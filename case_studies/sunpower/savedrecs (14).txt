AB In this study, silver pastes containing different sizes of glass frits were employed to form the front-side electrodes in order to examine the size effect of the glass frits on the interfacial microstructures between the front-side silver contacts and the n-type silicon emitter layers, which will subsequently affect the electrical performance of silicon solar cells. The interfacial microstructures at the Ag/Si interfaces were investigated by advanced electron microscopy techniques. The transfer length method (TLM) was used to measure the specific contact resistivity of silver electrodes screen-printed on the n-type silicon substrates. The particle size of the glass frits was found to strongly affect the interfacial microstructures and therefore resulted in different specific contact resistivities (rho (c)) of the fabricated silver ohmic contacts. Nanosized glass frits showed excellent etching ability during engineered thermal treatments. The samples made with silver pastes containing microsized glass frits showed a thick residual glass layer at the Ag/Si interface, while the silver paste with nanosized glass frits was found to form an interface with less glass residue, which led to lower resistance after otherwise identical processing.

AB Moth-eye structures were fabricated on monocrystalline silicon and monocrystalline silicon P-N junction solar cell surface respectively, using anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane as a mask by means of UV nanoimprint lithography. A nano-scale pattern of porous alumina membrane mask was transferred to the UV-curable precursor with high fidelity by a fabrication process conducted at room temperature and normal atmosphere. The antireflection film reduced the surface reflection to about 4% in the wavelength of 425-1200 nm for silicon and improved the conversion efficiency by 19% for solar cells. The moderate fabrication condition made the method suitable for applications in different kinds of solar cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solar energy can be harvested either by deriving directly from sunlight or by indirect methods. A variety of technologies have been developed to harness solar energy. Among them, utilisation of solar energy by solar cell is an important and effective method and has a high potential in the commercial market. Based on the techniques and materials used to fabricate solar cell, the solar cells are classified into three generations. First generation solar cells are the larger, silicon based photovoltaic cells. The disadvantages of these solar cells are limited availability of silicon, requires expensive manufacturing technologies and higher energy photons are wasted as heat. The second generation solar cells are called thin film solar cells, which are significantly cheaper than previous generation cells but have lower efficiencies. The third generation solar cells are still in the research phase, but the results are promising and encouraging. Generally, third generation cells include nanocrystalline solar cells and dye sensitised solar cells, they do not have the p-n junction as in traditional solar cells. Third generation solar cells provide a technically and economically credible alternative concept to present day p-n junction solar cells. In the present study, the technology of the dye sensitised solar cell is introduced with a short description about the operating principle of the cell. After this, a more detailed study is carried out about the dye sensitised solar cell, taking into account the key steps involved in photovoltaic energy conversion and also the other important fundamental operational aspects of the solar cell physics and chemistry.

AB Currently, a conventional two-step method has been used to generate black silicon (BS) surfaces on silicon substrates for solar cell manufacturing. However, the performances of the solar cell made with such surface generation method are poor, because of the high surface recombination caused by deep etching in the conventional surface generation method for BS. In this work, a modified wet chemical etching solution with additives was developed. A homogeneous BS layer with random porous structure was obtained from the modified solution in only one step at room temperature. The BS layer had low reflectivity and shallow etching depth. The additive in the etch solution performs the function of pH-modulation. After 16-min etching, the etching depth in the samples was approximately 200 nm, and the spectrum-weighted-reflectivity in the range from 300 rim to 1200 nm was below 5%. BS solar cells were fabricated in the production line. The decreased etching depth can improve the electrical performance of solar cells because of the decrease in surface recombination. An efficiency of 15.63% for the modified etching BS solar cells was achieved on a large area, p-type single crystalline silicon substrate with a 624.32-mV open circuit voltage and a 77.88% fill factor.

AB Ultraviolet-visible to near-infrared quantum cutting (QC) materials are a promising tool to enhance the efficiency of conventional crystalline silicon solar cells. The spectroscopic properties of Tb3+-Yb3+ co-doped ZrO2 nanocrystals are presented, and the QC mechanisms in these nanocrystals are investigated. The materials were fabricated using the sol gel method and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray absorption near edge structure, and luminescence spectroscopy. The incorporation of Yb3+ ions into the host induced a crystalline phase change of ZrO2 from monoclinic to tetragonal to cubic symmetry and influenced the Tb valence state. The T3+ visible emission, excitation intensity (monitored by the Tb3+:D-5(4) emission), decay time of the Tb3+:D-5(4) emitter level, and down-conversion (DC) emission intensity increased with Yb3+ concentration. Furthermore, a sublinear dependence of the DC intensity on the excitation power at the Tb3+:D-5(4) level indicated the coexistence of two different QC mechanisms from Tb3+ -> Yb3+. The first one is a linear process in which one Tb3+ ion transfers its energy simultaneously to two Yb3+ ions, known as cooperative energy transfer, and the second one is a non-linear process involving an intermediated virtual level in the Tb3+ ion.

AB This paper reports a new environmental friendly silver front contact paste for crystalline silicon solar cells. Quasi-spherical and high-dispersive silver particles were prepared from silver nitrate in hot ethylene glycol. Polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP) as a protective agent was added into the reduction system. Moreover, Bi-based glass frit powders with glass transition temperature (T-g) of 385 degrees C were prepared by traditional melting route. The silver front contact paste for crystalline silicon solar cells was prepared using the as-prepared superfine silver particles and Bi-based glass frit powders. The microstructures of the conductive silver thick films were investigated, which indicated that the wetting behavior and etching effect of the glass frit on silicon nitride and silicon were efficient. Besides, silver particles were sintered well with the help of the glass frit during firing processing. The fabricated solar cell containing the Bi-based glass frit as an inorganic binder showed higher Fill Factor (FF) and electrical conversion efficiency (E-ff) when compared with those of the solar cell fabricated with commercial Pb-based glass frit. In short, synthesis of silver particles in hot liquid polyols is a useful method for preparing superfine and high-dispersive particles. Moreover, the Bi-based glass frit could be a suitable substitute for Pb-based glass frit for preparing environmental friendly front-side silver paste for crystalline silicon solar cells.

AB Continued development of high-efficiency multi-junction solar cells requires growth of lattice-mismatched materials. Today, the need for lattice matching both restricts the bandgap combinations available for multi-junctions solar cells and prohibits monolithic integration of high-efficiency III-V materials with low-cost silicon solar cells. The use of III-V nanowires is the only known method for circumventing this lattice-matching constraint, and therefore it is necessary to develop growth of nanowires with bandgaps > 1.4 eV. Here we present the first gold-free gallium arsenide phosphide nanowires grown on silicon by means of direct epitaxial growth. We demonstrate that their bandgap can be controlled during growth and fabricate core-shell nanowire solar cells. We further demonstrate that surface passivation is of crucial importance to reach high efficiencies, and present a record efficiency of 10.2% for a core-shell single-nanowire solar cell.

AB Resonant dielectric structures are a promising platform for addressing the key challenge of light trapping in thin-film solar cells. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate efficiency enhancements in solar cells from dielectric nanosphere arrays. Two distinct amorphous silicon photovoltaic architectures were improved using this versatile light-trapping platform. In one structure, the colloidal monolayer couples light into the absorber in the near-field acting as a photonic crystal light-trapping element. In the other, it acts in the far-field as a graded index antireflection coating to further improve a cell which already included a state-of-the-art random light-trapping texture to achieve a conversion efficiency over 11%. For the near-field flat cell architecture, we directly fabricated the colloidal monolayer on the device through Langmuir-Blodgett deposition in a scalable process that does not degrade the active material. In addition, we present a novel transfer printing method, which utilizes chemical crosslinking of an optically thin adhesion layer to tether sphere arrays to the device surface. The minimally invasive processing conditions of this transfer method enable the application to a wide range of solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

AB Using pulsed-laser deposition method, crystalline ZnSe nano-needles have been grown on catalyst-coated silicon (100) substrates. The crystalline ZnSe nano-needles with the middle diameters of about 20-80 nm, and the lengths ranging from 100 to 600 nm can be grown densely on 300-400 degrees C substrates. The as-grown ZnSe nano-needles were well crystalline and base-grown. They are potential electron-capturing materials in polymer/inorganic hybrid solar cells for their properties of good electron-conductance and high ratio surface area. Based on the ZnSe nano-needle cathode, a five-layer composite structure of polymer/inorganic hybrid solar cell has been designed and fabricated. The absorption spectra of the blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), ZnSe nano-needles and the combination of P3HT: PCBM and ZnSe nano-needles were examined by ultraviolet-visible-infrared spectrophotometer, respectively. The absorption bands of the combination of P3HT:PCBM and ZnSe nano-needles fit well with the solar spectral distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A solar-driven hybrid generation system (HGS) in an integrated design is successfully fabricated, which consists of a silicon thin-film solar cell (STC), thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and a heat collector. STC absorbs parts of the solar energy and directly converts it into electric energy. The undesired waste heat from STC and parts of the solar energy are collected by the heat collector and conducted to TEG to produce thermoelectric conversion. The structure and the performance of HGS are discussed. A numerical simulation is also performed on TEG to obtain the distribution of heat flux using finite element method (FEM). The results show that the performances of TEG and STC are synchronously enhanced due to the integrated design. Especially the heat flux on the hot side of TEG integrated in HGS increases by more than tenfold. The total generated power of 393 mW is obtained in HGS, which is twice larger than that of single STC. The developed HGS is a promising power system which can effectively broaden the use of the solar spectrum and increase the power output in solar conversion. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We adopt a economical and original method to fabricate self-textured gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO) front contacts for hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) single-junction solar cells. This technique involves an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) and a dc sputtering process. The electro-optical characteristics of the textured GZO films are mainly controlled by the haze of organosilicon underlayers deposited by the APPJ. The films exhibit an average optical transmittance of about 80% and resistivity below 9.91 x 10(-4) Omega cm. Moreover, compared with flat solar cells, textured cells fabricated on moderate GZO front contacts show 7.9 and 10.9% enhancements in conversion efficiency and short-circuit current density, respectively.

ID POROUS SILICON; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; ARRAYS; GROWTH; SI(100)
AB Low-cost fabrication methods enabling the morphological control of silicon nanowires are of great importance in many device application fields. A top-down fabrication method, metal-assisted chemical etching, is proved to be a feasible solution. In this paper, some novel approaches based on metal-assisted chemical etching, alkaline solution etching, and electrochemical anodic etching are presented for fabricating micro-and nano-structures, which reveal the anisotropic characteristics of metal-assisted chemical etching in silicon. A new model is proposed to explain the motility behavior of Ag particles in metal-assisted chemical etching of silicon. It is shown that Ag particle forms a self-electrophoresis unit and migrates into Si substrate along [100] direction independently. Diameter and length control of silicon nanowires are achieved by varying Ag deposition and etching durations of metal-assisted chemical etching, respectively, which provide a facilitation to achieve high-aspect-ratio silicon nanowires at room temperature in a short period. These results show a potential simple method to microstructure silicon for devices application, such as solar cells and sensors.

AB Silicon-based films such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H), and hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H) can be deposited by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HW-CVD). The HW-CVD technology differs from conventional plasma-enhanced (PE)-CVD in a number of technological aspects, such as soft activation, high growth rates, and low system costs. To evaluate the HW-CVD technology for thin film deposition in solar industry an in-line hot-wire CVD system was used to deposit a-Si:H films for passivation of crystalline silicon solar cells as well as for the fabrication of thin film silicon solar cells. The HW-CVD system consists of seven vacuum chambers including three hot-wire systems with maximum deposition areas of 500 mm by 600 mm for each hot-wire activation source. The deposition processes were investigated by applying design of experiment to identify the effects and interactions of the process parameters on the deposition characteristics and film properties. The process parameters investigated were silane flow, deposition pressure, substrate temperature, film thickness, as well as temperature, diameter and number of wires, respectively. Growth rates up to 2.5 nm/s were achieved for a-Si:H films. Intrinsic a-Si:H films for passivation of different crystalline solar cell types yielded carrier lifetimes of more than 1000 mu s for film thickness values below 20 nm. For n-doped a-Si:H films prepared with PH3 as dopant gas, electrical resistivity is in the range of 10(2) Omega cm. P-doped a-Si:H films prepared with B2H6 as dopant gas show electrical resistivity of about 105 Omega cm. Crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells with intrinsic thin layer (HIT cells) exhibit energy conversion efficiencies of more than 17% when fabricated with intrinsic HW-CVD amorphous silicon films as passivation layers.

AB Because of its thermal and morphological stability and optical and electrical properties, tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum(Alq(3)) is one of the most widely used electron transporting materials in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). The search for substitutes for this compound constitutes an important field of research in organic electronics. We report on a study of a new rare-earth tetrakis 8-hydroxyquinoline complex. Synthesis of tris complexes with rare-earth metals and 8-hydroxyquinoline resulted in unstable compounds. However, the inclusion of an additional quinoline group stabilized these compounds. Li[RE(q)(4)] (where RE = La3+, Lu3+ and Y3+ and q = 8-hydroxyquinoline) were synthesized and then used as the electron-transporting and emitting layer in OLEDs. Thin films were deposited in a high-vacuum environment by thermal evaporation on quartz and silicon substrates. Optical characterization of the RE complexes revealed emission in the 510-525 nm range, the same as that observed for Alq(3), while absorption was observed at wavelengths of 382 nm for the Y/La complexes and 388 nm for the Lu complex. The OLEDs were fabricated with an indium tin oxide layer (ITO) as the anode, (N,N'-bis (1-naphtyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine) NPB as the hole-transporting layer (25 nm), Li[RE(q)(4)] as the electron-transporting and emitting layer (40 nm) and aluminum as the cathode (120 nm). The electroluminescence (EL) spectra showed a broad band from 520 to 540 nm and green-colored emission associated with the 8-hydroxyquinoline ligand. There was an interesting dependence of the maximum energy peak position and half-width of the emission band in the EL spectra on the atomic radius of the RE ion used. The best luminance for the OLEDs produced in this study was achieved with the Li[RE(q)(4)] compound. The optical and electrical properties of this OLED were comparable to those of similar devices based on Alq3. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the electronic band structures of Ge/Si core-shell nanowires (CSNWs) and devise a way to realize the electron quantum well at Ge core atoms with first-principles calculations. We reveal that the electronic band engineering by the quantum confinement and the lattice strain can induce the type-I/II band alignment transition, and the resulting type-I band alignment generates the electron quantum well in Ge/Si CSNWs. We also find that the type-I/II transition in Ge/Si CSNWs is highly related to the direct to indirect band gap transition through the analysis of charge density and band structures. In terms of the quantum confinement, for [100] and [111] directional Ge/Si CSNWs, the type-I/II transition can be obtained by decreasing the diameters, whereas a [110] directional CSNW preserves the type-II band alignment even at diameters as small as 1 nm. By applying a compressive strain on [110] CSNWs, the type-I band alignment can be formed. Our results suggest that Ge/Si CSNWs can have the type-I band alignment characteristics by the band structure engineering, which enables both n-type and p-type quantum-well transistors to be fabricated using Ge/Si CSNWs for high-speed logic applications.

AB The most straightforward route to reducing the cost of c-Si photovoltaics is to make cells thinner. However, as cell thickness is reduced, light absorption is compromised. This necessitates the use of light trapping mechanisms to mitigate reduction in absorption. In this paper, we present a novel method to fabricate a high efficiency solar cell on a 10 mu m thick silicon membrane. The method involves in-house fabrication of 10 mu m thick membranes and integration of optically efficacious inverted pyramid texture with feature size and pitch on the order of the solar wavelength via a resist-free laser-writing method.

ID FILM SOLAR-CELLS
AB To achieve desired voltage output, conventional solar panels have been fabricated using tab ribbons and soldering techniques to form the serial cell interconnection. This method is also adapted in CIGS and other thin film solar cells. Limitations of this interconnect technology has challenges relating to yield, reliability, and costs related to manufacturing processes and power loss due to grid shading along with cell packing density. Alternative cell interconnection methods have been under development. Several of these CIGS cell interconnection methods are evaluated including the use of silver loaded electrically conductive adhesive to attach the ribbon, shingle overlap and wire overlay type approaches. It is shown that the replacement of the traditional tab and string interconnect used by the silicon wafer module production by a higher packing density module design with low grid coverage can result in an increase in module performance by over 20%.

AB Ohmic contacts to n-type crystalline silicon created by local laser firing was studied in this paper. A novel metal stack of Al-Sb-Ti was fired through a dielectric layer or opposite doped amorphous silicon layer. Specific contact resistances of less than 1.9 m Omega cm(2) and 0.31 m Omega cm(2) using a pseudo transfer length method and a vertical test structure, respectively, are demonstrated. Recombination loss due to laser damage was consistent with an extracted local Surface Recombination Velocity (SRV) similar to 20,000 cm/s similar to values for laser fired base contact for p-type crystalline silicon. Hetero-junction devices were fabricated with laser fired back contact and proof-of-concept efficiencies of 14.4% on front silicon hetero-junction and 13.1% on interdigitated back contact silicon hetero-junction (IBC-SHJ) cells were achieved. This localized base contact technique will enable low cost back contact patterning and innovative design for n type crystalline solar cells.

AB A damage-free Si doping method using chemical vapor deposition of pure boron (PureB) layers is investigated for p(+) doping of solar cell emitters. After PureB deposition the layer is thermally diffused into the Si and evaluated by determining the dopant profile, sheet resistance and effective carrier lifetime. It was found that dopant profiles and sheet resistance could be controlled by optimizing the thickness of the initial PureB layer and the subsequent annealing conditions. Compared to a boron ion implanted sample of the same sheet resistance, samples fabricated with the PureB method showed higher effective lifetime of about 300 mu s as compared to 75 mu s. In addition to providing defect-free junctions, PureB deposits selectively on silicon and not on silicon oxide, and may therefore be attractive for novel cell architectures.

DE bifacial; electroplating; non-photolithographic patterning; passivation;

AB In this work we propose and demonstrate a novel and cost-effective method to fabricate bifacial cells with conventional homojunction architecture. The method combines benefits of lithography-less, self-aligned patterning during deposition of antireflective coating (ARC) and simultaneous metallization of both surfaces aided by electroplating. We have fabricated a conventional diffused n(+) pp(+) junction bifacial solar cell on a monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) substrate using this method. Electrochemically grown nickel is used to simultaneously form front and back electrodes. The bifacial solar cell fabricated with an un-optimized process has a front and rear efficiencies (under AM1.5G one sun illumination) of 12% and 8.66%, respectively. Part of the low performance of the cell is attributed to poor quality of the passivation layer and the post deposition annealing to reduce pinholes in deposited SiNx layer to prevent parasitic plating.

AB Effects like quantum confinement, multiexciton per incident photon and Stokes shift have prompted extensive research of silicon at nanoscale dimensions for potential application in next generation photovoltaics. Such effects are highly size-dependent, implying that a viable fabrication method and thorough understanding of size-related properties are essential for device applications. In this report, we present new results on fabrication and characterization of silicon nanocrystals (Si-NCs) for application in solar cells. Si-NCs were fabricated by Inductively Coupled Plasma CVD (ICPCVD) using SiO2/SiOx<2 superlattice approach. HRTEM imaging shows that ICPCVD is an excellent route for realizing tight size-controlled Si-NCs. Optical absorption measurements showed the optical bandgap tunability of Si-NCs. Stokes shift in absorption and emission was observed which could be exploited for down-shifter application in photovoltaics. Charge conduction mechanisms in the devices were studied. Ohmic behavior was observed in the low voltage regime (V-S < 0.59 V) whereas Trap Assisted Tunneling was observed in high voltage regime (1.03 V < V-S < 4 V).

AB Hybrid organic-inorganic heterojunction solar cells based on silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics owing to potentials for low fabrication cost and high efficiency. The SiNW array, fabricated by a simple metal-assisted wet chemical etching method, produces a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, hence allowing efficient light harvesting and charge collection via the formation of a core-sheath p-n junction. However, previously reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are approximately capped at 10%, which is largely depicted by the interface defect densities that limit the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor (FF). In this work, we introduce a solution-processed, intermediate 1,1-bis[(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC) layer to mitigate the interface recombination loss for hybrid heterojunction solar cells consisted of SiNWs and conjugate polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). A record PCE of 11.0% is achieved in contrast to 9.6% from a reference counterpart without TAPC, which represents an enhancement factor of 14.2% ascribed to noticeable improvement in the V-oc and FF. The result is further supported by examining indicators for the interface quality via a suppressed dark saturation current and an enhanced minority carrier lifetime which exhibits an increase from 84 mu sec without TAPC to 87 mu sec with TAPC.

AB We demonstrate a genetic method to fabricate large-area nano-structure III-V solar cells with conformal epitaxial growth on pre-patterned substrate. The design, simulation, fabrication, and characterization of a nano-structure gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cell device are presented. The optical simulation illustrates that the nano-pyramid array is able to suppress the reflection and enhance the absorption in a wide spectrum range. The IV characterization shows that the short circuit current of the nano-pyramid GaAs solar cell with 200 nm thick junction is as high as 18.5 mA/cm(2), which is more than triple of the planar cell. Our results suggest this nano-structure thin film absorber could significantly reduce epitaxial growth cost and increase yield, thus provides a pathway towards high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells.

Surface morphologies of films (5-27.5 nm) after annealing treatment with 260 degrees C and 400 degrees C were analyzed. The results showed that annealing temperature has important impact on self-assembled nanoparticles arrays. The tuning function of SiNx dielectric film was also analyzed. The absorption peak generates a redshift with the maximum range about 100 nm in the absorption spectrum, and the peak widths become wider with the increase of thickness of SiNx dielectric film for the same particle size distribution of Ag nanoparticles arrays.

AB The surface plasmon resonances induced light coupling is widely recognized as a promising way of enhancing the light absorption in photovoltic devices. This is achieved by enhanced localized electromagnetic field in the vicinity of metal surface or the strong light scattering effects from metal nanoparticles integrated on the front surface of as-fabricated solar cells. In this paper, the colloidal gold nanoparticles(Au NPs), synthesized by modified Turkevich and Frens method, were integrated onto the inverted nanopyramid silicon solar cell via a dip coating method. A 7% increase in short-circuit current density of solar cell was observed for 15 minutes dip coating. As a result, a 4.6% increase in overall efficiency was achieved. However,the dense surface coverage of Au NPs resulted in decreased fill factor.

AB Amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/amorphous silicon-germanium (a-SiGe:H) superlattices were deposited by 13.56MHz plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method using a mixture of SiH4, GeH(4)and H-2. The superlattice materials consist of alternating layers of a-Si:H and a-SiGe:H. The a-Si:H layers were used as barrier material and a-SiGe:H layers were used as well material. It was found that the optical bandgap was controlled by changing the thickness of the barrier layer of a-Si:H (2-10nm). Based on these results, fabricated the pin-type a-Si:H based solar cells of superlattice structures in different thickness for barrier and well layers. The various values of open-circuit voltage (V-oc), short-circuit current density (J(sc)), and conversion efficiency were measured under 100 mW/cm(2)(AM 1.5) solar simulator irradiation. In the fabricated structure, we achieved a higher conversion efficiency ( = 4.52%) than general a-Si:H solar cell ( = 2.10%) and a-SiGe:H solar cell ( = 3.06%).

TI Single-Crystalline Silicon Solar Cell with Selective Emitter Formed by
   Screen Printing and Chemical Etching Method: A Feasibility Study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY

ID TECHNOLOGY; EFFICIENCY
AB A new method for fabricating crystalline silicon solar cells with selective emitters is presented. In this method, shallow trenches corresponding to metal contact area are first formed by screen printing and chemical etching, followed by heavy doping over the whole front surface of the silicon wafer. After a polymer mask is pasted by aligned screen-printing to cover the shallow trenches, the silicon wafer is etched such that the heavy doping remains at the shallow trench area, while other areas become lightly doped. With the presented method, two screening printing steps are required for obtaining a selective emitter structure on a solar wafer. Compared with existing etch-back methods, the presented one is believed to be able to easily conform with present industrial process. Experimental results show that optical responses at the short and long wavelengths were both improved by applying the proposed selective emitter technique to fabricate solar cells with an a-Si: H film deposited on the back surface. The selective emitter cell with a-Si: H back surface deposition had improvements of 1.66 mA/cm(2) and 1.23% absolute in J(sc) and conversion efficiency, respectively, compared to the reference cell that had a homogeneous emitter and no a-Si: H on the back surface.

AB We report a facile fabrication method for the fabrication of functional large area nanostructured polymer films using a drop casting technique. Reusable and tapered silicon molds were utilized in the production of functional polymers providing rapid fabrication of the paraboloid nanostructures at the desired structural heights without the requirement of any complex production conditions, such as high temperature or pressure. The fabricated polymer films demonstrate promising qualities in terms of antireflective, hydrophobic and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) features. We achieved up to 92% transmission from the single-side nanostructured polymer films by implementing optimized nanostructure parameters which were determined using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method prior to production. Large-area nanostructured films were observed to enhance the Raman signal with an enhancement factor of 4.9 x 10(6) compared to bare film, making them potentially suitable as freestanding SERS substrates. The utilized fabrication method with its demonstrated performances and reliable material properties, paves the way for further possibilities in biological, optical, and electronic applications.

AB We report a novel plasmonics silicon solar cell design, with the possibility of lower cost and higher efficiency. The proposed solar cells consist of radial p-n junction silicon nanopillars array in combination with plasmonics metal nanoparticles on its surface. Simple and solution processible methods such as metal assisted electroless chemical etching (MACE) and Spin on Dopant (SOD) techniques were used for the fabrication of the described solar cells. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown aluminum oxide (Al2O3) was employed as an emitter surface passivation layer. Despite having the high surface to volume ratio of the nanopillar arrays textured surface, we observed an open circuit voltage (V-OC) and the short circuit current density (J(SC)) as high as 572mV and 29.9mA/cm(2) respectively, which leads to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in excess of 11.30%, for the optimized structure of the solar cells described herein. Unlike the optical performance, the electrical performance of the aforementioned solar cells, degrade with the increase in nanopillar height beyond 400 nm. Upon the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles to the previously fabricated nanopillar arrays, the power conversation efficiency of the combined structure was observed to decrease to 10.79%. This can be attributed due to a reduced open circuit voltage in spite of having a higher fill factor.

ID ARRAYS; DESIGN
AB Achieving a broadband antireflection property from material surfaces is one of the highest priorities for those who want to improve the efficiency of solar cells or the sensitivity of photo-detectors. To lower the reflectance of a surface, we have decided to study the optical response of a top-flat cone shaped silicon grating, based on previous work exploring pyramid gratings.
   Through rigorous numerical methods, such as Finite Different Time Domain or Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis, we then designed several structures theoretically demonstrating an antireflective character within the middle infrared region. From the opto-geometrical parameters such as period, depth and shape of the pattern determined by numerical analysis, these structures have been fabricated using controlled slope plasma etching processes. Afterwards, optical characterizations of several samples were carried out. The reflectance of the grating in the near and middle infrared domains has been measured by Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometry and a comparison with numerical analysis has been made. As expected, those structures offer a fair antireflective character in the region of interest. Further numerical investigations led to the fact that patterning the top of the cone could enlarge the antireflective domain to the visible region. Thus, as with the simple cone grating, a comparison of the numerical analysis with the experimental measurements is made.
   Finally, diffracted orders are studied and compared between both structures. Those orders are critical and must be limited as one wants to avoid crosstalk phenomena in imaging systems.

AB A novel method to fabricate ultra-low reflective Si surfaces with nanoscale hierarchical structures is developed by the combination of AlOOH or boehmite nanoflakes nested on plasma-etched Si nanopillars. Using CF4 plasma etching, Si surfaces are nanostructured with pillar-like structures by selective etching with self-masking by fluorocarbon residues. AlOOH nanoflakes are formed by Al thin film coating with various thicknesses and subsequent immersion in boiling water, which induces the formation of nanoscale flakes through the hydrolysis reaction. AlOOH nanoflakes are formed on Si nanopillared surfaces for hierarchical structures, which are coated with a low-surface-energy material, resulting in a higher water wetting angle of over 150 degrees and a very low contact angle hysteresis of less than 5 degrees, and implying a self-cleaning surface. Reflectance reduced to 5.18% on average on hierarchical nanostructures in comparison to 9.63% on the Si nanopillar surfaces only. We found that Si nanopillars reduced reflection for wavelengths ranging from 200 to 1200 nm while AlOOH nanoflakes reduced reflection for wavelengths longer than 600 nm.

Rutile phase TiO2 nanoparticles were directly used as starting material to prepare film and led to a simple preparation process. It was found that several different microstructures existed in the sample and changed with the varied positions from the center to the edge of the film when the concentration of the TiO2 suspension is 0.06 mol/l, the deposition time is 30 min, the flow rate is 1 l/min and the temperature is 150 degrees C. The surface texturing shows apparent distinction as the concentration of the TiO2 suspension decreased to 0.03 mol/l and 0.01 mol/l.

AB A novel perpendicularly aligned CdTe array with cauliflower-like morphology was fabricated on a Ni substrate using a simple electrochemical synthesis method. The samples were characterized by XRD, EDX and FESEM, and the results demonstrate that a high-purity, uniform cauliflower-like CdTe array was obtained. Rod lengths can reach to 3.0 mu m, with nanoparticles stacking along the rod growth direction, keeping the diameter at 1.5 mu m. A schematic diagram of the possible growth process and evolution from CdTe seed nuclei to the cauliflower-like CdTe array was proposed. The device based on the aligned array-on-Ni configuration demonstrates excellent photoelectrical properties, which is ascribed to the large absorption coefficient of the material and also suggests good electronic structure quality of the cauliflower-like rods. The technique described is applicable to fabricate highly aligned cauliflower-like semiconductor arrays on other conductive substrates.

AB Light trapping structures are a promising approach to increase light absorption in ultrathin absorbers of interest for photovoltaic applications. To be integrated within real systems, their fabrication approach need to be simple and scalable, insuring that the gain in efficiency is worth the extra manufacturing steps. Here, we optimize through simulation using a RCWA code, a variety of 1D and 2D structures that can be fabricated with such simple and scalable techniques. In particular, we investigate the effect 1D and 2D gratings fabricated by Nanoimprint Lithography, onto Bragg mirrors that could be made using simple liquid process approaches. The optimized structures exhibit a significant gain in absorption with almost twice as much absorption in the wavelength range 0.5 to 1 micron, compared to a bare absorbing film of GaAs chosen as our reference. We also identify the various phenomena behind the absorption peaks observed and study the angular dependency of absorption with these structures.

AB Nitrogen doped amorphous silicon carbide (N-doped a-SiC) thin films were fabricated by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PeCVD) method using mixed solution of tetramethylsilane (TES) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) as a liquid source. Chemical composition of N-doped a-SiC thin film was Si:C = 1:4 and sp(2)-bonded carbon ratio was 0.75. N-doped DLC were multi-phase structure including a-SiC phase, sp(2) clusters and a-Si clusters. Optical gap and resistivity of the film were 1.68 eV and 4.32x10(4) Omega cm, respectively. From photocurrent measurement under UV exposure, it was clarified that the film functioned as n-type semiconductor materials with 4.87% of quantum yield, which was on the same level as that obtained at anatase-type titanium oxide prepared by sol-gel method.

AB Texturization is a useful method to enhance the optical absorption of monocrystalline silicon wafers by light-trapping effect in solar cell processing. In present study, a series of textured wafers with various pyramid sizes ranging from 200 nm to 10 mu m were fabricated by modified wet-chemical method and characterized. The results show that there is little difference in the reflectance with the pyramid sizes from 1 to 10 mu m, which is consistent with the ray-tracing simulation results. However, the light-trapping function of the 200 nm sample below the geometrical optics limit is much weaker. The solar cells fabricated from the 1 mu m samples own the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.17% due to a better coverage of metal finger lines than the larger ones, and the 200 nm samples have the lowest efficiency of 10.53%.

AB We report a simple and effective vapor deposition method for directly growing ultra-long, laterally aligned, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod arrays only on the side edges of a bare silicon (Si) substrate without using any catalysts and precursors. The growth on the top surface of the substrate is restrained by controlling the flow of source vapor in a tube furnace through the chemical vapor solid process. The optimized growth parameters have been thoroughly investigated and identified. Direct growth of laterally aligned ZnO nanowire arrays on the desired surface of the substrate is successfully achieved. A vapor solid mechanism with source vapor flow rate control has been proposed to explain the synthesis: ZnO nanodots first form on the bare Si substrate side edges due to the local large binding energy and high zinc (Zn) vapor concentration, and then nanorods epitaxially grow from the nanodots. In addition, the lateral, ultra-long ZnO nanorods grown on orthogonal silicon microelectrodes are achieved and could be expected to find important applications in a bottom-up way of fabricating the next generation nanoelectronics.

TI One-Step Fabrication of Hierarchically Structured Silicon Surfaces and

SO JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS

DT Article
ID NANOWIRES
AB Fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructures is a key issue for optical devices, fluidic devices, and solar cells because of their unique functionalities such as antireflection and superhydrophobicity. Here, we report a novel one-step process to fabricate patternable hierarchical structures consisting of microstructures and one-dimensional nanostructures using a sacrificial layer. The layer plays a role as not only a micromask for producing microstructures but also as a nanomask for nanostructures according to the etching time. Using this method, we fabricated patterned hierarchical structures, with the ability to control the shape and density of the nanostructure. The various architectures provided unique functionalities. For example, our sacrificial-layer etching method allowed nanostructures denser than what would be attainable with conventional processes to form. The dense nanostructure resulted in a very low reflectance of the silicon surface (less than 1%). The nanostructured surface and hierarchically structured surface also exhibited excellent antiwetting properties, with a high contact angle (>165 degrees) and low sliding angle (<1 degrees). We believe that our fabrication approach will provide new insight into functional surfaces, such as those used for antiwetting and antireflection surface applications.

AB Upgraded metallurgical grade (UMG) silicon has been researched both on the purification methods and its material properties for years, indicating that it is the most promising choice as low-cost feedstock for photovoltaics. In this work, UMG multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) prepared by cold crucible refining and electron beam melting was investigated. Solar cells based on such silicon wafers were fabricated in a 156 x 156 mm(2) production line and their photovoltaic properties were characterized. Compared with the conventional mc-Si solar cells fabricated in the same commercial production line, the UMG mc-Si solar cells with two busbars presented higher average open circuit voltage (V-oc) and average fill factor (FF), which were 628 mV and 78.6 % separately. Although the UMG mc-Si solar cells showed a lower shot-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 32.7 A/cm(2) in the average and an early reverse breakdown voltage at around 11 V which was due to higher impurities content. The average conversion efficiency of the UMG mc-Si solar cells reached 16.14 %, and the highest conversion efficiency was up to 16.31 %. In addition, the UMG mc-Si solar cells presented relatively low light induced degradation (LID) due to the material properties. Consequently, in consideration of low cost, our UMG mc-Si solar cells substantially met the requirements of commercial manufacturing and had a great potential application for photovoltaic industry.

AB An effective and economical fabrication process for the synthesis of nanopore-type "black silicon", that significantly decreases reflectivity of silicon wafer surfaces, is reported using a room temperature one-step Ag-assisted chemical etching method. The effects on the surface morphology and the corresponding surface reflectivity of the concentration of the silver catalyst (500, 50, and 5 mu M), the HF and H2O2 concentration in the silicon etchant, the HF:H2O2 ratio, and etching time have been investigated. Lower reflectivity is a balance between sufficient silver catalyst to create large numbers of nanopores on a silicon surface and excessive silver that brings deeply etched channels that would potentially short-circuit a solar cell junction. The lowest relative effective reflectivity (0.17% over a range of 300-1000 nm) occurs with a silver ion concentration of 50 mu M, however, with the silver ion concentration decreases to 5 mu M surfaces with a low relative effective reflectivity (2.60%) and a short nanopore length (<250 nm) can be obtained with 10 minute etching time, indicating that this method can be used as a simple (one-pot), low cost (low silver concentration), energy efficient (room temperature), method for the synthesis of anti-reflection layers for silicon-based solar cell applications.

AB Broadband and omnidirectional light harvesting is important in photovoltaic technology because of its wide spectral range of radiation and the sun's movement. This study reports the fabrication and characterization of zinc oxide (ZnO) dandelions on Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) solar cells. The fabrication of dandelions involves the combination of self-assembled polystyrene (PS) nanospheres and the hydrothermal method, which is one of the simplest and cheapest methods of fabricating a three-dimensional, closely packed periodic structure. This study also investigates the optimization on dimension of the PS nanospheres using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method. This study uses an angle-resolved reflectance spectroscope and a homemade rotatable photo I-V measurement to investigate the omnidirectional and broadband antireflections of the proposed dandelion structure. Under a simulated one-sun condition and a light incident angle of up to 60 degrees, cells with ZnO dandelions arrays enhanced the short-circuit current density by 31.87%. Consequently, ZnO dandelions are suitable for creating an omnidirectionally antireflective coating for photovoltaic devices.

AB The p-type quasi-mono wafer is a novel type of silicon material that is processed using a seed directional solidification technique. This material is a promising alternative to traditional high-cost Czochralski (CZ) and float-zone (FZ) material. Here, we evaluate the application of an advanced solar cell process featuring a novel method of ion implantation on p-type quasi-mono silicon wafer. The ion implantation process has simplified the normal industrial process flow by eliminating two process steps: the removal of phosphosilicate glass (PSG) and the junction isolation process that is required after the conventional thermal POCl3 diffusion process. Moreover, the good passivation performance of the ion implantation process improves V-oc. Our results show that, after metallization and cofiring, an average cell efficiency of 18.55% can be achieved using 156 x 156 mm p-type quasi-mono silicon wafer. Furthermore, the absolute cell efficiency obtained using this method is 0.47% higher than that for the traditional POCl3 diffusion process.

AB We presented a method to use SiO2/SiNx:H double layer antireflection coatings (DARC) on acid textures to fabricate colored multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells. Firstly, we modeled the perceived colors and short-circuit current density (J(sc)) as a function of SiNx:H thickness for single layer SiNx:H, and as a function of SiO2 thickness for the case of SiO2/SiNx:H (DARC) with fixed SiNx:H (refractive index n = 2.1 at 633 nm, and thickness = 80 nm). The simulation results show that it is possible to achieve various colors by adjusting the thickness of SiO2 to avoid significant optical losses. Therefore, we carried out the experiments by using electron beam (e-beam) evaporation to deposit a layer of SiO2 over the standard SiNx:H for 156 x 156 mm(2) mc-Si solar cells which were fabricated by a conventional process. Semisphere reflectivity over 300 nm to 1100 nm and I-V measurements were performed for grey yellow, purple, deep blue, and green cells. The efficiency of colored SiO2/SiNx:H DARC cells is comparable to that of standard SiNx:H light blue cells, which shows the potential of colored cells in industrial applications.

AB This paper presents the preparation and characterization of nanostructured TiO2 films designated to the integration of antireflective (AR) layers into the fabrication process of the silicon solar cells. The nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) layers have been obtained by the anodization of the Ti layer deposited by sputtering technique on glass substrates and silicon wafers. The obtained TiO2 films were optically characterized using the Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) and the values of the refractive index are in a range of 1.66-1.76 at 632 nm radiation wavelength. The transmittance of 90 urn TiO2 thin films deposited on transparent substrate, evaluated by the spectrophotometry method, is over 70%. The TiO2 band gap of 3.3 eV was evaluated from the spectral transmittance characteristic. Silicon solar cells with various AR coatings of TiO2, SiO2 and SiO2 - TiO2 have been fabricated. The optoelectrical characterization proved that the output maximum power (P-max) for the solar cell with a 90 urn TiO2 layer is with 28% greater than P-max for the solar cells with SiO2 as AR layer and with 15.5 % greater than P-max for the solar cells having a two-layer antireflective coating of SiO2 - TiO2.

AB We demonstrate the fabrication of n-GaN: Si/p-GaN:Mg nanowire arrays on (111) silicon substrate by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method. The nanowires were grown by a newly developed two-step growth process. The diameter of as-grown nanowires ranges from 300-400 nm with a density of 6-7 x 10(7) cm(-2). The p-and n-type doping of the nanowires is achieved with Mg and Si dopant species. Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) indicates that the nanowires are relatively defect-free. The room-temperature photoluminescence emission with a strong peak at 370 nm indicates that the n-GaN: Si/p-GaN: Mg nanowire arrays have potential application in light-emitting nanodevices. The cathodoluminscence (CL) spectrum clearly shows a distinct optical transition of GaN nanodiodes. The nano-n-GaN:Si/p-GaN:Mg diodes were further completed using a sputter coating approach to deposit Au/Ni metal contacts. The polysilazane filler has been etched by a wet chemical etching process. The n-GaN: Si/p-GaN: Mg nanowire diode was fabricated for different Mg source flow rates. The current-voltage (I-V) measurements reveal excellent rectifying properties with an obvious turn-on voltage at 1.6 V for a Mg flow rate of 5 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute).

AB Radial heterojunction photodiodes based on a silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs)-zinc oxide (ZnO) core-shell structure is demonstrated in this report. The heterojunction can be constructed by spin-coating ZnO nanoparticles onto SiNWs and a low temperature post-annealing process (<270 degrees C). The photodiode displays typical diode rectifying characteristics with an ideality factor of as low as 1.28, and shows an excellent photoresponse in both visible and near infrared regions in which a peak value of 0.54 A/W at zero bias was attained. The sensitivity is superior to that of previously reported devices fabricated with vacuum-deposition methods. In contrast, the planar silicon-ZnO junction only displays the peak photoresponsivity of 0.34 A/W. The superior performance of radial junction is ascribed to the highlight-harvesting capability, large interfacial area and efficient charge carrier collection arising from the core (SiNWs)-shell (ZnO) structure. Here, high temperature processes are dispensable by using facile solution-processed techniques, which avoid thermal minority lifetime degradation of silicon and simplify the fabrication process of the photodiodes.

ID ZNO FILMS; AL
AB Anodic-aluminum-oxide (AAO) template lithography and atomic layer deposition (ALD) antireflection coating techniques have often been applied for the fabrication of wide-angle antireflection structures on silicon solar cells. In this study, an AAO template was fabricated as a mask to block the high density plasma dry etching from the crystalline silicon to form nanostructures on the surface of the crystalline silicon wafer. Then, a 55-nm-thick aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) film was deposited on the silicon nanostructures using the ALD method. The results show that the application of a nanostructured AZO film can decrease the average reflectivity of the crystalline silicon to 0.83% in the wavelength range from 400 to 850 nm for an incident angle of 8 degrees. The conversion efficiency of the nanostructured silicon solar cell can be enhanced from 6.93% to 8.37%. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1116/1.4767837]

AB Nanocrystalline ZnS:Mn thin films were fabricated by a chemical bath deposition route on glass, silicon, and quartz substrates using a weak acidic bath, in which citrate ions acts as a nontoxic complexing agent for zinc ions and thioacetamide acts as a source of sulfide ions at 60 degrees C. The composition of films were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction pattern and transmission electron microscopy image confirm that the films have nanocrystalline nature. The band gap energy of ZnS: Mn films is blue-shifted by about 0.3 eV with respect to the bulk value (3.67 eV), probably due to the quantum size effect as expected from the nanocrystalline nature of the ZnS: Mn thin films. The dispersion and optical constants of the films were determined. These parameters changed with the deposition time.

AB A Ge:Si solar cell under a silicon solar cell can lead to as much as a 5.5% absolute efficiency gain for a multi-junction solar module at 30 x concentration. This work demonstrated short circuit current densities that were 93% of the model prediction and open circuit voltages that were 92% of the model predictions for 88% Ge content, Ge:Si solar cells below Si at 30 suns. Silicon solar cells can absorb few photons in the wavelength range above 1150 nm due to the effect of the absorption coefficient. One possible method to enhance the absorption of long wavelength photons is to apply a Ge solar cell below Si. However, this method is industrially impractical due to the high cost of Ge substrates. In this work, a low cost Ge:Si solar cell grown on silicon with strong long wavelength light sensitivity will be demonstrated. This work starts with an all epitaxial growth design, analyzes the performance limits, examines the trade-offs between solar cell performance, Ge composition and material quality and concludes with the pathways to higher efficiency. The high quality Ge:Si layers with Ge content above 85% were achieved on Si substrates using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology. Three high Ge content Ge:Si solar cells were designed, fabricated and analyzed. The encouraging results experimentally prove that low cost Ge:Si solar cells grown on Si can have high performance below Si. This has been achieved as a direct result of low dislocation density step graded Ge:Si buffers developed in this research. In this paper, the pathway to achieve low cost and high efficiency Ge:Si low band gap solar cells grown on silicon is described. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
