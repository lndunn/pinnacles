AB Texturization of mono-crystalline silicon for solar cell fabrication is still a key issue due to consumption of large amount of costly isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in conventional NaOH/KOH solution. The need of IPA arises due to the improvement in the uniformity of pyramidal structures and elimination of spots caused by bubbles sticking on the wafer surface during the texturization process. We investigated a new texturization technique for mono-crystalline silicon solar cells with tribasic sodium phosphate (Na3PO4, 12H(2)O) Solution with much less amount of IPA. The proposed texturization method of this paper is cost effective due to reduction in the consumption of expensive IPA. The cost comparison of our novel texturization approach with conventional NaOH texturization has also been reported in this paper. We are reporting for the first time such a novel approach of using tribasic sodium phosphate for texturization of mono-crystalline silicon surface with which solar cells of efficiency 14-14.8% are fabricated with more than 90% yield.

AB A novel growth technology of microcrystalline silicon (pc-Si:H) thin films has been developed using short-pulsed VHF plasma CVD method [K. Nomoto, et al., Short-pulse VHF plasma-enhanced CVD of high-deposition-rate a-Si:H films, in: Proceedings of the 14th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition, 1997, pp. 1226-1230]. The homogeneity of crystallinity in a film over square meter was improved by using this technology. We applied this technology to intrinsic layers of pc-Si:H single solar cell, and confirmed that the homogeneity of cell's characteristics on a large-scale substrate was improved. And using this novel fabrication technology to intrinsic layers of a-Si:H/mu c-Si:H tandem thin-film Si solar cell, initial conversion efficiency of 12.1 %, corresponding to about I I % stabilized conversion efficiency was obtained with a large-scale substrate size of 925 mm x 560 mm.

AB Solar cells have been made from hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films. The films including Si nanoparticles by 3 % in volume fraction have been found to possess the best properties. In order to find the method to control this volume fraction, the flow of Si nanoparticles in the source gases H-2 and SiH4 is examined for a chemical vapor deposition reactor by use of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. For the operating conditions considered here, the flow of nanoparticles has a promising property; the flux distribution of nanoparticles on the wafer is uniform, in particular, for smaller nanoparticles. The flux is nearly proportional to d(3)(-3.5), where d(3) is the diameter of nanoparticles. The flux is independent of the flow rate of carrier gas and is proportional to the total pressure.

AB The hydrogenation of crystalline Si by methods used to passivate defects in Si solar cells has been studied by infrared spectroscopy. For these experiments, floating-zone Si that contained Pt impurities that act as traps for H was used as a model system in which H could be directly detected. In this model system, the concentration and indiffusion depth of H were determined for different hydrogenation treatments so that their effectiveness could be compared. The postdeposition annealing of a hydrogen-rich SiNx surface layer was found to introduce H into the Si bulk with a concentration of similar to 10(15) cm(-3) under the best conditions investigated here.

DE spherical Si; solar cell; dropping method; decompression state
AB A spherical Si solar cell with a reflector cup was successfully fabricated by a dropping method at decompression state. In the dropping method, melted Si droplets were instilled at decompression state (0.5 x 10(5) Pa) to reduce crystal growth rate, dominating crystal quality such as dislocation density in crystal grains, Spherical Si solar cells were fabricated using the spherical Si crystals with a diameter of 1 mm and then mounted on a reflector cup. The current-voltage measurement of the solar cell shows an energy conversion efficiency of 11.1% (short-circuit current density (J(sc)): 24.7 mA center dot cm(-2), open-circuit voltage: 601 mV, fill factor: 74.6%). Minority carrier diffusion length determined by surface photovoltage method was 98 mu m. This value can be enhanced by the improvement of crystal quality of spherical Si crystals. These results demonstrate that spherical Si crystals fabricated by the dropping method has a great potential for substrate material of high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells.

AB Spherical Si solar cells were fabricated based on multicrystalline Si spheres produced by a dropping method. The thermal history of Si spheres were calculated by numerical simulation. The simulation result reveals that heat transfered by convection is greater than heat transfered by radiation. Considering the calculation results, Si spheres were dropped in the free-fall tower at low pressure state (0.2 x 10(5) - 0.5 x 10(5) Pa) to slow heat transfer by convection. After dash etching for 60 min, low pressure Si spheres have less etch pits, i.e., 80% for etch pit density and 8% for etch pit-area ratio compared to normal one. Furthermore, the conversion efficiency was improved from 6.57% (normal pressure spherical Si solar cell) to 9.56% (low one), which is 45% relative increase. The improvement is due to decrease of undercooling and increase of crystal growth duration. These results demonstrate that the dropping method at low pressure state is useful for fabricating high performance spherical Si solar cells.

AB Anti-reflection (AR) thin film with high and low reflective index layers was successfully fabricated by a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly method. For the deposition of high refractive index layer, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and titanium(IV) bis (ammonium lactato) dihydroxide (TALH) were alternatively assembled and then, annealed at 200 degrees C for 5h. The average thickness of (PDDA/TALH) was determined to be 3.0 +/- 0.15 nm and the refractive index was n = 2.2 at 550 nm. Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were assembled on high refractive index layer for the deposition of low refractive index layer. The average thickness of (PAH/PAA) was determined to be 4.6 +/- 0.1 nm and the refractive index was n = 1.51 at 550 nm. The prepared AR thin film was assembled from 21 bilayers of PDDA/TALH and 20 bilayers of PAH/PAA and the thickness control was achieved with nano-scale precision. The thickness and surface roughness of AR thin film were 155 +/- 3 and 6.5 nm, respectively. This AR thin film showed the maximum transmittance (99%) and the minimum reflection (0.04%) around 550 nm in wavelength. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electronic properties of poly-Si thin films fabricated by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) were improved by annealing in H2O or D2O vapors. Hall mobility was improved from 4.45 cm(-2)/V s to 25.1 cm(-2)/V s after 1 h D2O vapor treatment at 300 degrees C, i.e., nearly the same value as after optimized plasma hydrogenation. Unlike the hydrogen plasma treatment, annealing did not introduce disorder into the material, judged by the width of Raman LO-TO band. Water vapor treatment is a novel approach to improvement of thin films properties, with potentially low cost suitable for mass production of solar cells, but its mechanism is not yet clear.

In order to improve the hole injection from the a-Si:H bottom cell, we insert a thin conductive p-a-Si:H layer between the n-mu c-Si:H and p-a-SiC:H layers. We deposit all layers by the photo-CVD method. Due to ion-damage free characteristics, we could obtain high quality films. We measure the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic and activation energy in order to characterize the fabricated tunnel junction. We have applied this n-p-p tunnel junction to a pe-Si:H multilayer/a-Si:H tandem solar cell and achieved 9.24% energy conversion efficiency whereas only 7.84% efficiency was obtained for a tandem solar cell with no p-a-Si:H insertion layer.

X-ray pole figure measurements confirmed that the Si sphere includes twin crystals. The spherical Si solar cells were fabricated using Si spheres. The spherical Si solar cells consisting of almost the same number of crystal grains exhibited various performance characteristics, because no clear correlation between the X-ray pole figure measurements indicating the grain number and the solar cell performance characteristics was confirmed. An X-ray rocking curve and a Dash etching method for the spherical Si solar cells indicated that the short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage of the solar cells depend on the crystallinity of intragrains.

AB An array-antenna-type very high frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF-PECVD) system based on a multisubstrate deposition technique has been developed for the large area (> 1 m(2)), high-throughput and low-cost production of thin-film silicon solar cells. A hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) solar cell fabricated at around 20 Pa showed an initial efficiency of 7.44% for a deposition rate of 0.32nm/s with evaporated Ag as the back contact. The uniform formation of each layer was observed, and the quantum efficiency spectrum after exposure to air indicates high-stability high-quality film formation. The advantage of the novel array antenna method is discussed in terms of the material property as well as production cost.

AB We have developed a highly stabilized hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell with extremely low Si-H, bond density in the i layer using a triode-plasma CVD method. Si-H-2 bond density decreased from 1.7 to 0.6 at.%, and correspondingly the degradation ratio of the cell efficiency decreased from 13% to 10% in comparison to the conventional diode system. It was also found that the hydrogen dilution mainly affects Si-H bond density rather than Si-H, bond density in the films. Further optimization for the TCO/p interface results in the stabilized cell efficiency of 9.22%. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solar cells and optical detection devices often incorporate antireflective surfaces to reduce undesired reflection and enhance optical absorption. This letter reports a "black silicon" structure of antireflective porous silicon fabricated by using electrochemical etching. The sample has a gradient-index multilayer structure, i.e., the refraction indices of the structure increase from the top (near the air) to the bottom (near the Si substrate). Reflectance below 5% is obtained over a broad wave number range (3000-28000 cm(-1)) and the depression mechanism of the optical reflectance is analyzed by simulating the structure with the transfer matrix method. The simulated result fits the measured spectra well. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

AB We have investigated the crystal growth mechanism of spherical Si fabricated by a dropping method. The Si spheres were classified into two categories by surface morphology. The grain size of a Si sphere with a smooth surface is larger than that C with a rough surface. To investigate the crystal growth mechanism of the spheres, Si samples with various crystal sizes were observed. Si sample size is related to Si droplet size of, which influences the ease of solidification. Large Si droplets take longer to solidify than small Si droplets. Si samples 4, 2 and 1 mm in diameter correspond to the initial. intermediate and final stages of crystal growth, respectively. In the Si sample 4 turn in diameter, a disk of (111) plane crystals is observed. This result suggests that the initial crystal growth of the Si spheres consisting of large grains involves the formation of a disk of (111) plane Si crystals. The crystal growth mechanism for a Si sphere 1 mm in diameter is proposed.

AB The effects of hydrogen passivation oil spherical Si solar cells are investigated. The spherical Si solar cells fabricated from Si spheres produced by a dropping method are multicrystal line Si with dislocations and grain boundaries. In order to inactivate the defects, H-passivation with RF plasma was performed. The short-circuit Current density and the open-circuit voltage of spherical Si solar cells increased after H-passivation, consequently, the conversion efficiency was enhanced. Current-voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency indicated the bulk passivation effect of recombination centers. Moreover, the minority carrier diffusion length (L-n) of the solar cell was estimated by the Surface photovoltage method. L-n increased from 14.6 to 30.5 mu m upon H-passivation. Laser-beam-induced Current (LBIC) analysis indicated that the crystal defects Such as dislocations and grain boundaries were made electrically inactive by H-passivation.

AB We have carried Out a systematic Study of photodegradation of tailored nanostructure Si solar cells deposited by controlling their medium range order (MRO). The nanostructure of Si films can be precisely tailored by changing the thickness of their sublayers deposited under different hydrogen dilutions. Raman spectroscopy reveals that MRO rapidly improves with increasing high-hydrogen-dilution sublayer thickness up to 2 nm, while the short range order (SRO) changes slowly. The degradation ratio of the solar cells fabricated by this method can be reduced to less than 5% and such cells show ail excellent stabilization efficiency. We have observed the direct correlation between MRO and the degradation ratio of the solar cells.

AB High-quality (110)/(101)-oriented epitaxial beta-FeSi2 films were fabricated on Si (111) substrate by the sputtering method. The critical feature was the formation of a high-quality thin beta-FeSi2 template buffer layer on Si (111) substrate at low temperature. It was demonstrated that the template is very important for the epitaxial growth of thick beta-FeSi2 films and for the blocking of Fe diffusion into the Si at the beta-FeSi2/Si interface. Hall effect measurements for beta-FeSi2 films showed n-type conductivity, with residual electron concentration around 2.0 x 10(17) cm(-3) and mobility of 50-400 cm(2)/V s. A prototype thin-film solar cell was fabricated by depositing n-beta-FeSi2 on p-Si (111). Under 100mW/cm(2) sunlight, an energy conversion efficiency of 3.7%, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.45V, a short-circuit current density of 14.8 mA/cm(2) and a fill factor of 0.55, was obtained.

By the application of an ultrasonic system one can obtain a film with the lower surface roughness and the higher quality. The electrical resistivity of the electroplated Ni/Cu was investigated for vacuum annealing at various temperatures.
   Contact resistance of the Ni/Cu structure on n(+)Si was measured using the Transmission Line Model (TLM) method. An optimum specific contact resistance of 2x10(-5) Omega cm(2) Was obtained for layers annealed at 400 degrees C for 10 minutes. SEM, XRD and EDX analyses were used to investigate the surface morphology, structure and composition of deposited films.

ID OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; LIFETIMES
AB The minority carrier diffusion length as a function of carrier density has been extracted from the spectral response of the open-circuit voltage of silicon solar cells, which has been measured with the quasi-steady-state spectral photovoltage technique, QSSV(oc)-lambda. The method can determine a relative internal quantum efficiency for a broad range of voltages, and therefore, of carrier injection levels. From the internal quantum efficiency, the diffusion length is derived using standard procedures. High-efficiency solar cells fabricated on p-type multicrystalline silicon of four different resistivities have been used in this investigation. While the analysis of the spectral response of the short-circuit current did not show any injection dependence of the diffusion length, the analysis of the spectral response of the voltage, on the contrary, unveiled that the diffusion length can have a strong dependence on carrier density, even at very low injection levels.

In order to improve the quality of silicon spheres, we developed a novel seeding crystallization technique for the solidification of silicon droplets in high-speed dropping. High-pure silicon powders were used as seeding source material. They were embedded into the silicon droplets by floating and confining within a specific region on the dropping route. Experimental results demonstrated that this method is very effective on improving the crystalline quality and on reducing the defects and dislocations of the silicon spheres. A solar call module having about 4x lens concentrator was developed without polishing the spheres. A conversion efficiency of 11.3% under AM1.5, 100 mW/cm(2) sunlight was achieved from single sphere with size of 1.0 mm in diameter.

ID ALUMINUM-INDUCED CRYSTALLIZATION
AB Research is underway at UNSW aiming at the realization of efficient and inexpensive polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cells on glass. The idea behind the program is to significantly lower the cost of PV electricity by (i) making the solar cells from a thin film of crystalline silicon, (ii) using electron-beam evaporation for silicon deposition, (iii) using glass as the supporting material, and (iv) creating large-grained poly-Si absorber layers by means of a seed layer. We chose e-beam evaporation of silicon because it provides a much higher deposition rate than all other low-temperature Si deposition methods. Due to the inherent cost constraints of PV, we have limited our work from the outset to non ultra high vacuum conditions. So far, three different solar cells have been developed in the course of the program: EVA, ALICE and ALICIA. In this paper it is shown that good progress is being made towards efficient evaporated poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass. From the results achieved so far it is already clear that silicon evaporation in a non-UHV environment is capable of producing device-grade poly-Si thin-films for solar cells. Interestingly, this conclusion applies to materials fabricated with each of the three approaches investigated by us (SPC, SPE, IAD).

AB We have developed a new material that can be used for encapsulation of a-Si modules fabricated on TCO coated glass substrates. This is a polymer based material which can be sprayed on the back side of the module. The encapsulation is done by curing it at 600-700C for a period of two hours. The material is transparent over a wavelength region of 300nm - 2000nm (transmission > 95%) and can withstand temperature range -30 degrees C to 100 degrees C without any change of property. The efficacy of this type of encapsulation has been tested on a number of single and double junction modules. It has been found that after encapsulation the initial wattage of the modules increase by 5-6%. This may be due to relaxation of the cell structure deposited on the glass substrate during the curing of the encapsulant. This type of encapsulation has also been tested by exposure to atmosphere. It has been seen that for light soaked modules there is virtually no environmental degradation of the encapsulated modules. Thus we have been able to develop a cheap and comparatively simple encapsulation method for a-Si modules deposited on glass substrates.

TI Development of a phosphorus spray diffusion system for low-cost silicon

ID RAPID THERMAL-DIFFUSION
AB Phosphoric acid was used an n-type doping source to make an emitter for silicon solar cells. This paper reports on a cold spray method to coat phosphoric acid on the silicon wafer without any additional complicated and corrosive heating system. The key spray parameters such as belt speed, flow rate of the carrier gas, and concentration of phosphoric acid are optimized to get uniform and reproducible sheet resistance for the emitter. The diffusion process has been studied by firing silicon wafers that are spray-coated with phosphoric acid. screen printed solar cells have been fabricated using the emitter formed by the spray coating. The effects of the emitter on cell performance have been investigated and compared with those of the conventional POCl3-diffused emitter. screen printed/spray- diffused cells give impressive cell efficiencies of similar to 16.6% on 1 Omega cm float zone wafers, which is nearly equal to those of POCl3 emitter cells (similar to 16.9% ). Compared with the POCl3 emitter cell, the spray-diffused cells show slightly lower quantum efficiency at the short-wavelength response and slightly higher emitter saturation current density (similar to 3.59 x 10(-13) A/cm(2)) compared with (2.73 x 10(-13) A/cm(2)). Further optimization can eliminate this small difference in efficiency.

AB This paper reports on recent improvements in the fabrication of 5 to 15-mu m-thick self-standing porous Si seed films for monocrystalline epitaxy. A multiple three-step anodizing method allows us to separate multiple self-standing porous films from a single 4-in. Si wafer with only one mounting step. So far, we have separated up to three self-standing porous films with diameters of 85 mm (limited by our etch setup) with one continuous anodizing process. The porous films are used as seeding layers for monocrystalline Si epitaxy. Solar cells fabricated from 38-mu m-thick monocrystalline silicon films show independently confirmed efficiencies up to 13.6%. (c) 2006 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Fabrication of texturing antireflection structures in solar cells by
   using the defocusing exposure in optical lithography
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID SILICON
AB In this paper, we demonstrate a simple method, combining optical lithography and reactive ion etching processes to fabricate antireflective pyramid structures for solar cell applications. By tuning the defocusing distance and exposure dosage of an optical stepper, the optimized pyramid structure in resist can be obtained. After conventional etching processes, the reflection of silicon substrate can be reduced to less than 2% in the spectra regime from 300 to 800 nm. The arrangement of pyramid structures is designed in hexagonal close-packed structures for different directions of sunray. In contrast with previous works, reflectance of texturing structures is affected by optical lithography processes rather than etching processes in our works. The exposure parameters can be easily fine-tuned in an optical stepper. Therefore, high performance of texturing structures in solar cells with a large area and high reproducibility can be achieved. This method is also suitable for the fabrication of antireflective structures on various kinds of solar cell materials by transferring the pyramid resist to underlying materials.

AB beta-FeSi2 is an attractive semiconductor owing to its extremely high optical absorption coefficient (alpha > 10(5) cm(-1)), and is expected to be an ideal semiconductor as a thin film solar cell. For solar cell use, to prepare high quality beta-FeSi2 films holding a desired Fe/Si ratio, we chose two methods; one is a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method in which Fe and Si were evaporated by using normal Knudsen cells, and occasionally by e-gun for Si. Another one is the facing-target sputtering (FTS) method in which deposition of beta-FeSi2 films is made on Si substrate that is placed out of gas plasma cloud. In both methods to obtain beta-FeSi2 films with a tuned Fe/Si ratio, Fe/Si super lattice was fabricated by varying Fe and Si deposition thickness. Results showed significant in- and out-diffusion of host Fe and Si atoms at the interface of Si substrates into beta-FeSi2 layers. It was experimentally demonstrated that this diffusion can be suppressed by the formation of template layer between the epitaxial beta-FeSi2 layer and the substrate. The template layer was prepared by reactive deposition epitaxy (RDE) method. By fixing the Fe/Si ratio as precisely as possible at 1/2, systematic doping experiments of acceptor (Ga and B) and donor (As) impurities into beta-FeSi2 were carried out. Systematical changes of electron and hole carrier concentration in these samples along variation of incorporated impurities were observed through Hall effect measurements. Residual carrier concentrations can be ascribed to not only the remaining undesired impurities contained in source materials but also to a variety of point defects mainly produced by the uncontrolled stoichiometry. A preliminary structure of n-beta-FeSi2/p-Si used as a solar cell indicated a conversion efficiency of 3.7%.

AB Si-wafers for solar cells were cast in a size of 50 x 46 x 0.5 mm(3) by a direct casting method. A graphite mold coated by boron nitride (BN) powder was used in order to prevent the reaction between carbon and the molten silicon. Without any coating, the reaction of the Si melt to the graphite mold was very severe. In the case of BN coating, SiC was formed in the shape of tiny islands on the surface of the Si wafer by the reaction between the Si-melt and the carbon of the graphite mold at high temperature. The grain size was about 1 mm. The efficiency of the Si solar cell was about 0.5% under AM 1.5 conditions. It was lower than that of a Si solar cell fabricated with a common single- (sc, 3.0%) and polycrystalline (pc, 1.0%) Si wafer, which showed much lower efficiency than that of other commercial pc- or sc-Si solar cell (10-15%).

AB Spherical Si solar cells were fabricated based on polycrystalline Si spheres with a diameter of 1 mm produced by a dropping method. To decrease the cooling rates of Si spheres by decreasing the convection heat transfer to ambient, the Si spheres we re dropped in a free-fall tower at a pressure of 0.2 atm. The conversion efficiency of low-pressure spherical Si solar cells was higher than that of normal-pressure spherical Si solar cells. Both Si spheres were polycrystals that consisting of crystal grains of about 200 pm. The distribution between electric active defects and the crystal quality were characterized by electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By EBIC measurements, the lowpressure spherical Si solar cells were clearly observed to have the lower recombination sinks than the normal-pressure spherical Si solar cells. By TEM, the dislocation density in the low-pressure spherical Si solar cells was observed to be more reduced than that in the normal-pressure spherical Si solar cells. The dislocation density in the low-pressure Si spheres decreased because the reduction in the stress generated in the crystal grain.

AB Spherical Si solar cells are fabricated using polycrystalline Si spheres with a diameter of 1 mm produced by a high-speed dropping method. The distribution and types of electrically active defects in spherical Si solar cells have been directly characterized using electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Many recombination sink areas in grains and grain boundaries can be directly observed with EBIC in low-efficiency cells. The electrically active defects in grains are stronger recombination sinks than grain boundaries. The electrically active defect areas confirmed using EBIC were selectively etched with a Dash etching solution. TEM images revealed that the area showed a high dislocation density. These results suggest that the dislocations in grains deteriorate the performance of spherical Si solar cells.

AB Bulk and surface passivation by silicon nitride has become an indispensable element in industrial production of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells. Microwave PECVD is a very effective method for high-throughput deposition of silicon nitride layers with the required properties for bulk and surface passivation. In this paper an analysis is presented of the relation between deposition parameters of microwave PECVD and material properties of silicon nitride. By tuning the process conditions (substrate temperature, gas flows, working pressure) we have been able to fabricate silicon nitride layers which fulfill almost ideally the four major requirements for mc-Si solar cells: (1) good anti-reflection coating (refractive index tunable between 2.0 and 2.3); (2) good surface passivation on p-type FZ wafers (S-eff < 30 cm/s); (3) good bulk passivation (improvement of IQE at 1000nm by 30% after short thermal anneal); (4) long-term stability (no observable degradation after several years of exposure to sunlight). By implementing this silicon nitride deposition in an inline production process of mc-Si solar cells we have been able to produce cells with an efficiency of 16.5%. Finally, we established that the continuous deposition process could be maintained for at least 20h without interruption for maintenance. On this timescale we did not observe any significant, changes in layer properties or cell properties. This shows the robustness of microwave PECVD for industrial production.

AB A simple method of synthesizing nanomaterials and the ability to control the size and position of them are crucial for fabricating nanodevices. In this work, we developed a novel ammonia aqueous solution method for growing well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays on a silicon substrate. For ZnO nanorod growth, a thin zinc metal seed layer was deposited on a silicon substrate by thermal evaporation. Uniform ZnO nanorods were grown on the zinc-coated silicon substrate in aqueous solution containing zinc nitrate and ammonia water. The growth temperature was as low as 60-90 degrees C and a 4-in. wafer size scale up was possible. The morphology of a zinc metal seed layer, pH, growth temperature, and concentration of zinc salt in aqueous solution were important parameters to determine growth characteristics such as average diameters and lengths of ZnO nanorods. We could demonstrate the discrete controlled urowth of ZnO nanorods using sequential, tailored growth steps. By combining our novel solution method and general photolithography, we selectively grew ZnO nanorod arrays on a patterned silicon substrate. Our concepts on controlled ZnO nanorod growth using a simple solution method would be applicable for various nanodevice fabrications.

AB A silver contact with polysilicon fabricated on glass substrates was investigated both experimentally and theoretically by means of measured and 2D-simulated C-V characteristics. The in situ phosphorus-doped polysilicon layer is grown by a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) technique and crystallized in a vacuum by thermal annealing. The measured C-2-V characteristics of the Schottky contact at two frequencies reveals a linear behaviour at the 10 kHz curve and a distinct non-linear behaviour at the 300 kHz one. Extraction of the frequency independent capacitance by the Kevin method allows the determination of the values of doping concentration (N-D = 5 x 10(18) cm(-3)) and Schottky barrier height (phi(b) = 0.65 eV). The 2D-numerical simulation code of the Schottky contact C-V characteristics is also developed by considering that the inter-granular traps density N-T is localized in the grain boundaries. The effects of the film doping concentration and the trap states density are investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE spherical silicon; solar cell; concentration
AB A spherical Si solar cell with a semi-light-concentration system was successfully fabricated using a spherical Si crystal produced by a dropping method. The dropping method has great potential for low-waste and low-cost fabrication because the Si spheres can be made directly from dropping melted Si without the cutting and polishing processes of Si ingots. The fabricated Si spheres were generally multicrystalline due to the crystal growth through homogeneous crystal nucleation in containerless states. Spherical Si solar cells were fabricated using a Si sphere with a diameter of I mm as a solar cell substrate and then mounted on a reflector cup with a hexagonal aperture to complete the semi-light-concentration system. The current-voltage (J-V) measurement of the cell demonstrated an energy conversion efficiency of 10.4%. The key parameters for achieving higher efficiency are discussed with J-V data analysis, and quantum efficiency and laser-beam-induced current measurements.

AB The emitter-junction dopant-impurity profile has the most significant influence on solar cell efficiency for both laboratory and industrial production purposes. Optimization of the emitter profile., including the junction depth and surface concentration, before solar cell fabrication, therefore, controls the targeted cell efficiency. Several expensive and sophisticated methods are available for determining the dopant-impurity profile of the emitter junction like secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and spreading resistance probe (SRP). However, for the first time, we have used a simple method based on anodic oxidation and the Hall Effect to develop and optimize a controlled phosphorous diffusion process for achieving higher cell efficiency in solar cell industry, This method is a cost-effective and highly reliable one for regular diffusion process monitoring in any crystalline silicon solar-cell fabrication process. It can also drastically reduce the process rejection loss due to bad diffusion. Based on the optimized dopant profile, we have fabricated cells with better spectral response in the shorter-wavelength region. Also, the illuminated T-V characteristics were observed at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for our standardization purpose.

AB An impedance analysis method is introduced that enables the reliable determination of the doping concentration and the built-in potential of nonideal semiconductor p-n diodes featuring poor values for the shunt resistance, the series resistance, and/or the diode saturation current. The sample doping concentration on the lightly doped side of the p-n junction and the built-in potential are determined using the classic 1/C-2 vs V representation. The small-signal capacitance C for each reverse bias voltage V is directly extracted from the measured frequency dependence of the sample's impedance Z. A crucial feature of the method is the determination of the diode's series resistance and shunt resistance for each reverse bias voltage used. The method is verified using high-quality p-n junction diodes fabricated in silicon wafer substrates and its capabilities are demonstrated on nonideal p-n junction diodes fabricated in polycrystalline silicon thin films on glass substrates.

AB Heavily B-doped silicon ribbons were prepared by modified silicon sheets from powder (SSP) technique using 9 N purity electronic-grade silicon powder. Utilizing the SSP ribbons as substrates, crystalline silicon thin film (CSiTF) solar cells have been fabricated by direct epitaxy method. As-prepared CSiTF solar cells were characterized by illuminated and dark I-V characteristic measurement, Suns-V-oc measurement, quantum efficiency (QE) and reflectance measurement. The results show that the CSiTF solar cells have poor performance with typical efficiency eta only about 4.25%, and nearly all the characteristic parameters are far away from the ideal values. By detailed analysis and discussion on the measured results, it was found that grain boundary (GB) recombination in the active layers and electrical leakage at the edge of the PN junctions play a major role in deteriorating the performance of the CSiTF solar cells, which lead to higher dark saturation current Is and lower parallel resistance R-sh, respectively. By improving the preparation process, such as optimization of the epitaxy process, use of remote plasma hydrogen passivation (RPHP), optimization of the metallization and use of double layer anti-reflection (DLAR) coatings, etc., all the characteristic parameters of the CSiTF solar cells have been greatly improved, and the best efficiency value increased to 8.02%.

AB High-efficiency 4 cm(2) untextured screen-printed solar cells were achieved on cast multicrystalline silicon. These cells were fabricated using a simple manufacturable process involving POCl3 diffusion for emitter, PECVD SiNx: H deposition for a single-layer antireflection coating and rapid co-firing of Ag grid, Al backcontact, and Al-BSF in a belt furnace. An optimized process sequence contributed to effective impurity gettering and defect passivation, resulting in high average bulk lifetimes in the range of 100-250 mus after the cell processing. The contact firing contributed to good ohmic contacts with low series resistance of < 1 Omegacm(2), low backsurface recombination velocity of <500 cm/s, and high fill factors of similar to0.78. These parameters resulted in 16.9% and 16.8% efficient untextured screen-printed cells with a single layer AR coating on heat exchanger method (HEM) and Baysix mc-Si. The identical process applied to the untextured float zone wafers gave an efficiency of 17.2%. The same optimized co-firing cycle, when applied to HEM mc-Si wafers with starting lifetimes varying over a wide range of 4-70 mus, resulted in cell efficiencies in the range of 16.5%-17%.

ID SILICON FILMS; RATIO
AB Poly-Si films were produced using a metal-induced growth technique by sputtering from an n-type Si target onto a 50 nm thick Co seed-layer at 625degreesC. Silicon grew heteroepitaxially on the CoSi2 layer formed due to the reaction between the sputtered Si atoms and Co at the beginning stage of deposition. A 5 mum thick Si film with grain features up to 1 mum was produced on the thin and flexible tungsten substrate by using a two-step sputtering method. The films also have a natural texture structure on the surface that is strongly recommended in thin-film solar cells in order to obtain high current density by increasing incident light trapping. After post-sputtering annealing at 700degreesC, the measured minority carrier lifetime for poly-Si film was 1.33 mus which shows the film to be suitable for photovoltaic applications. To explore the photovoltaic applications by using MIG poly-Si films, Au/n-Si Schottky photodiodes were fabricated due to the process simplicity. The effects of different parameters, which include film doping density, active-layer thickness, Si film surface conditions and hydrogenation, were studied. It was found that with the increasing of doping density, the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) increased while short-circuit current density (J(sc)) decreased. Increasing the poly-Si active-layer thickness tended to improve the light absorption with an increased J(sc), but the V-oc was decreased due to a higher value of reverse saturation current. Because the metal/semiconductor interface condition facilitates the carrier transport in Schottky devices, the earlier study of modifying the Si surface by polishing showed an improved V-oc. The overall photo response was further improved by plasma hydrogenation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of hydrogen passivation on spherical Si solar cells are investigated. The spherical Si solar cells fabricated from Si spheres produced by a dropping method are multicrystalline Si including dislocations and grain boundaries. In order to inactivate the defects, H-passivation was done by R.F. plasma. The short circuit current density and the open circuit voltage of spherical Si solar cells increased after H-passivation, consequently, the conversion efficiency was enhanced. Current voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency indicated the bulk passivation effect of recombination centers. Laser beam induced current analysis indicated that the crystal defects such as dislocations and grain boundaries were electrically inactive by H-passivation.

AB This paper shows that direct low-frequency (LF) deposition of SiN films at 425 degrees C by PECVD followed by a conventional screen-printed contact firing cycle is more effective than a high-frequency (HF) SiN film deposited at 300 degrees C in passivating both bulk defects and the emitter surface. The emitter saturation current density (J(oe)), was found to be higher for LF SiN compared to the HF SiN just after deposition. J(oe) values for LF SiN reduced dramatically after contact firing to 100-200 fA/cm(2), well below the J(oe) for HF SiN passivated emitters. Solar cells fabricated on float zone (FZ) Si and mc-Si grown by the Heat Exchanger Method (HEM) yielded efficiencies as high as 17.2% and 16.8%, respectively, when coated with LF SiN. The enhanced cell performance is corroborated by a higher short wavelength IQE response in FZ and HEM cells and a higher post hydrogenation lifetime in HEM mc-Si cells coated with LF SiN.

AB Metal-induced growth (MIG) of microcrystalline Si (pc-Si) thin films has been proposed and studied due to potentially reduced process cost and decrease in the thermal budget. Large grain size Si films were produced by using Ni or Co as seed layers. The optimization of the process is very important in order to fabricate device quality mu c-Si thin films. In this paper, three important process optimizations are reported and discussed. Two-step sputtering controls the sputtering power and deposition rate at different stages of Si film deposition to produce large grain Si films with < 220 > preferred orientation together with improved J(sc) and V-oc for Schottky solar cells. A double seed layer method uses a thin Co layer on top of a Ni layer to reduce the Ni diffusion into the Si films, which decreased leakage current and increased the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Oxygen level and resulting thermal donor effect was suppressed by filtering the sputtering gas to 50 ppb oxygen level. The total charge state density in the Si film was reduced so that the J(sc) was improved due to less oxygen impurity in the Si film. With the optimized condition (two-step sputtering, 5 nm-Co/25 nm-Ni double seedlayer, using an oxygen filter and annealing of the Si film at 800 degrees C in forming gas (15% H-2), Au/n-Si (5 mu m) Schottky junction solar cells showed a J(sc) and V-oc of 12 mA/cm(2) and 0.215 V, respectively. By passivating the MIG pc-Si surface with hydrogenated nanocrystalline Si (nc-Si:H), the V-oc was improved to 0.31V. Note that Schottky solar cells were used for convenience and may not be the final device of choice.

AB Microcrystalline Si (pc-Si) thin films deposited at relatively low temperature by using the metal-induced growth (MIG) method have the potential for less metal impurity contamination and relative large grains with preferred crystal orientation in the < 220 > direction. Au/n-Si Schottky junction and P-N junction devices were fabricated using pc-Si films deposited under different process conditions. Electrical properties studied by using dark current (I-V), temperature dependence of current-voltage (I-V-T) and C-V analysis are important to reveal the current transport and understand the effects of the process conditions on the device performance. Single-stage sputtering Si deposition gave a Schottky junction device with a high degree of non-ideality and low barrier height. With a two-step sputtering process, in which the sputtering power and deposition rate were properly controlled, the device characteristics were largely improved since the Si grain size increased dramatically. Hydrogenation of the Si film by electron cyclotron resonance plasma treatment further improved the device characteristics in both ideality factor and barrier height. I-V-T testing revealed tunneling in current transport which was attributed to the high oxygen level and resulting thermal donor effect. By filtering the oxygen in the sputtering gas, the total charge state density was 3 times lower and tunneling was suppressed, especially in the high temperature region. Regarding the P-N junction devices, the similar I-V-T results implies that current transport in MIG Pc-Si devices was mainly controlled by the bulk Si film instead of the device junction.

AB Production technologies for light-weight, large-area and flexible solar cells are reviewed. Roll-to-roll processes including an originally developed stepping-roll deposition process are used to fabricate large-area hydrogenated amorphous silicon-based solar cells in succession on plastic film substrates. A unique monolithic device structure for the insulating film substrates having through-hole contacts was developed and applied to simplify the production processes and to generate high voltage using connection in series. Newly developed deposition methods of (1) plasma excitation frequency controlled chemical vapor deposition, (2) low substrate temperature selective reactive sputtering, and (3) large-area uniform transparent conductive oxide film deposition are reviewed. Finally, our recently developed 4 m-long, light-weight, large-area building-integrated modules are introduced.

AB We have investigated p- and n-type microcrystalline Si1-xCx (muc-SiC) thin films fabricated by a plasma chemical vapor deposition method using an excitation frequency of 40.68 MHz in comparison with those fabricated with conventional 13.56-MHz excitation. The muc-SiC films were deposited employing a new carbon source of C2H6 gas on a glass substrate at a low substrate temperature. Differences in structural, optical and electrical properties of the muc-SiC films that occur with the increase in the excitation frequency are discussed. Regarding muc-SiC deposited with 40.68-MHz excitation and reduced total gas flow rate, the optical energy gaps and dark conductivities simultaneously increase due to an increase in the unintentionally introduced oxygen concentration rather than to an increase in the carbon content.

AB Hot Wire Cell (HW-Cell) method has been developed in order to grow microcrystalline silicon (muc-Si:H) thin films. The influence of various deposition parameters on the structural and electrical properties of the films was investigated to improve film quality. It was found that the concentrations of O and C atoms in muc-Si:H films could be reduced from the order of 10(21) cm(-3) to the order of 10(20) cm(-3) by decreasing the partial pressure of SiH4 from 100 mTorr to 3 mTorr. Then, a novel 2-step growth method was proposed in order to reduce the incubation layer in the initial growth of muc-Si:H i-layer. By using this method, J(sc) largely increased (10.11 --> 18.32 mA/cm(2)), and as a result, the conversion efficiency of 3.9% could be achieved. The influence of the incubation layer on solar cell performances was also investigated by a numerical analysis. To date, a conversion efficiency of 5.3% (V-oc: 0.48 V, J(sc): 20.56 mA/cm(2), F.F.: 0.54, active area: 0.086 cm(2), AM1.5) was obtained for tic-Si:H solar cells with an i-layer thickness of 1.0 mum. Furthermore, high-rate depositions were investigated and a maximum deposition rate of 11.5 nm/s could be achieved. muc-Si:H solar cells fabricated at a high deposition rate of 1.5 nm/s showed a conversion efficiency of 2.8% (V-oc: 0.42 V, J(sc): 12.31 mA/cm(2), F.F.: 0.54, active area: 0.086 cm(2), AM1.5).

AB In order to realize a polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin film solar cell with low cost and high efficiency, high-quality poly-Si is indispensable. We fabricated a high-quality poly-Si film by using aluminum induced crystallization (AIC) as a method of crystallizing amorphous silicon. AIC is a method of crystallizing amorphous silicon by heat treatment below the eutectic temperature (577degreesC). Using AIC poly-Si film as the seeding layer and atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD), continuous columnar poly-Si with large grain size was achieved. Deposition of the poly-Si thin film onto AIC poly-Si films was carried out using APCVD. Crystallinity and electronic property of the deposited films was evaluated. Comparably high Hall mobility of more than 80 cm(2)/Vs was successfully obtained.

AB The poly-Si film was deposited by using the metal-induced growth (MIG) method on tungsten substrates. By making Au/n-Si Schottky photo-diodes, doping density effect was studied by using three different doping level Si sputtering targets. Increasing the Si target resistivities from 0.02Omega-cm to 50Omega-cm, open-circuit-voltage (V-oc) decreased from 0.22V to 0.14V while short-circuit-current density (J(sc)) increased from 1.55mA/cm(2) to 2.42mA/cm(2). C-V results revealed a high charge density in the device, which may be due to the oxygen thermal donor effects. Using an oxygen filter for the sputtering gas effectively reduced the charge densities and increased the J(sc) value. The p/n junction solar cells were fabricated by using ion implantation at 10(13) similar to10(14)cm(-2) dose and 100 similar to200keV. The cells with wider emitter layer by double-ion implantation gave higher J(sc) and V-oc values. Passivation of the Si film by using hydrogenation improved the J(sc), V-oc and spectral response of the solar cells.

ID ARGON DILUTION
AB Dilution by At of silane plasma has been reported to increase the stability of a-Si:Hfilms. A critical question is whether Ar diluted i-layers offer higher stabilized solar cell efficiencies than the conventional hydrogen dilution method. We have fabricated a-Si:H p-i-n solar cells with RF-PECVD i-layers by Ar dilution of silane. Ar dilution ratio (ADR, Ar/SiH4), RF power, pressure, and i-layer thickness were varied. At low ADR < 20, such solar cells show comparable initial efficiencies and stability as those devices having H-2-diluted i-layers of similar thickness. For cells made with ADR > 20, the initial efficiency decreases dramatically with further increase in Ar dilution, and light soaking causes only mild changes in efficiencies. The stabilized efficiencies of cells made with high ADR are inferior to the cells produced with low ADR or cells prepared by H-2 dilution. Further, V-oc of solar cells made with high ADR (> 50) decreases substantially in ambient, indicating a porous microstructure susceptible to oxidation. While thermal annealing improves the V-oc, a full recovery of V-oc is made by accelerated light soaking.
   The combination of high power and high ADR can lead to nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) growth, although nucleation is much more difficult to attain by the Ar dilution method compared to hydrogen dilution. We have succeeded in fabricating p-i-n solar cells with nc-Si:H i-layers prepared by the Ar dilution approach. The double dilution by Ar and hydrogen of silane (Ar+H-2+SiH4) can result in nc-Si:H i-layers with enhanced long wavelength spectral response compared to devices incorporating nc-Si:H i-layers grown by H-2 dilution only. The nc-Si:H solar cells with Ar+H-2 diluted i-layers exhibit no light-induced degradation.
   Using energetic Ar-rich plasma, in a process much simpler than the traditional nc-Si:H technique, doped a-Si:H thin layers can be prepared to form excellent tunnel junctions for multi-junction solar cells. We demonstrate such a novel, non-contaminating tunnel junction in tandem a-Si/a-Si and a-Si/nc-Si solar cells entirely fabricated in a single-chamber RF-PECVD system.
