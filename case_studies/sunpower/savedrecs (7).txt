AB This paper presents a facile approach for the rapid and maskless fabrication of hierarchical structures by multi-beam laser interference. In the work, three-and four-beam laser interference lithographies were proposed to fabricate ordered multiscale surface structures instead of six or more beam interference with a complicated system setup. The pitch and shape of hierarchical structures can be controlled by adjusting the parameters of incident light. The experiment results have shown that the hierarchical anisotropy and isotropy surface structures can be fabricated by this method with the control of the parameters of each incident beam, which is in accordance with the theoretical analysis and computer simulations.

AB Metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) is a simple, low-cost and versatile method of fabricating various silicon nanostructures. Due to the etching anisotropy of monocrystalline silicon, i.e. its different crystal orientation has different number of silicon back bonds needed to be broken in the etching, process, the obtained silicon nanostructures are morphology variable. It has been demonstrated that, by choosing the species or morphologies of catalyst, adjusting the etchant composition or concentration, changing the doping species and level of the silicon substrate, or introducing extra physical fields, MACE method can be used to prepare various desired silicon nanostructures. This review summarizes the most recent contributions in the fabrication of designable monocrystalline silicon nanostructure by MACE. In order to provide a relatively complete comprehension of the MACE, the fundamental principle and basic manipulation process of a conventional MACE, as well as the main influence factors on the etching effects are given; and the common applications of MACE in silicon etching are briefly reviewed. This article also presents some new developed improved MACE technologies and their potential applications in the extended field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three porous silicon (PS) samples with different porosities by electrochemical anodization are fabricated. Then, TiO2 nanoparticles are deposited on PS by two methods, spin coating and electron beam gun. I-V characteristics of all samples show diode behavior. Our result showed that transient current decreases with increasing porosity for PS/Si samples while increases for TiO2/PS/Si samples in both deposition methods. The reason could be due to filling pores by TiO2 nanoparticles and reduction of resistivity on PS surface. Also, our result showed that transient current increases highly for samples which were deposited by electron beam gun with respect to spin coating. The reason could be that in spin coating method TiO2 sol with high viscosity was used and causes that TiO2 nanoparticles cannot easily penetrate into PS pores. But in electron beam gun method TiO2 nanoparticles reaches to PS surface as a few atoms and can easily penetrate into PS pores. Ideality factor of our samples reduces after TiO2 deposition. Also, ideality factor of samples which were deposited by electron beam gun decreases with respect to spin coating, since transient current and I-V curve slop increase in electron beam gun.

AB This paper reports the design, fabrication and characterization of broadband antireflection coatings for silicon-based solar cells, using a graded-index technique and a novel dual-beam pulsed laser deposition method. A graded refractive index was realized by mixing two different optical materials, silicon and soda-lime glass, in a way that the composition of the mixture changes gradually from silicon (that of the solar cell) to glass (that of the outside protective glass) along the coating thickness direction following pre-designed refractive-index profiles. In this study, two different refractive-index profiles were fabricated, linear and Southwell profiles, on silicon substrates. In order to emulate a protective cover glass for solar-cells, coatings with an additional 400 nm-thick outer glass layer were also fabricated. The antireflection coatings showed reflectance of 2.2-5.5% (mostly around 4%) for a wavelength range of 4001000 nm, and for the Southwell profile with a top glass layer, the reflectance was found to be between 2.2% and 4%, which is believed to be close to the theoretically best antireflection performance of a solar cell with a cover glass. Finite-difference time-domain simulations were also performed and the numerical results were in line with the measurement results. Because these coatings are based on silicon and glass and can be fabricated by the one-step pulsed laser deposition procedure, it can simplify the solar-cell structure considerably. The fabricated antireflection coatings may be also used for many other optical applications, such as thin-film optical attenuator and some optical sensors, and the presented pulsed laser deposition method is capable of fabricating a variety of high-performance optical coatings, which cannot be fabricated by other methods.

AB Aluminium induced texturing (AIT) method has been used to texture glass substrates to enhance photon absorption in microcrystalline thin film Si solar cells. In this process, a thin Al film is deposited on a glass substrate and a non-uniform redox reaction between the glass and the Al film occurs when they are annealed at high temperature. After etching the reaction products, the resultant glass surface presents a uniform and rough morphology. In this work, three different textures (sigma(rms) similar to 85, similar to 95, similar to 125 nm) have been achieved by tuning the dc sputtering power and over them and over smooth glass, pin micro crystalline silicon solar cells have been fabricated. The cells deposited over the textured substrates showed an efficiency improvement in comparison to the cells deposited over the smooth glass. The best result was given for the glass texture (sigma(rms)similar to 125 nm that led to an average efficiency 2.1% higher than that given by the cell deposited on smooth glass.

AB fImmiscible polymer blends tend to undergo phase separation with the formation of nanoscale architecture which can be used in. a variety of applications. Different wet chemistry techniques already exist to fix the resultant polymeric structure in predictable manner. In this work, an all-dry and plasma-based strategy is proposed to fabricate thin films of microphase-separated polyolefin/polyether blends. This is achieved by directing (-CH2-)(100) and (-CH2-CH2-O)(25) oligomer fluxes produced by vacuum thermal decomposition of poly(ethylene), and poly(ethylene oxide) onto silicon substrates through the zone of the glow discharge. The strategy enables mixing-of thermodynamically incompatible macromolecules at the molecular level, whereas electron-impact initiated radicals serve as. cross-linkers to arrest the subsequent phase separation at the,nanoscale. The mechanism of the phase separation as well as the morphology of the films is found to depend on the ratio between the oligomeric fluxes. For polyolefin-rich matures, polyether molecules self-organize by nucleation and growth into spherical domains with average height of 22 rim and average diameter of 170 nm. For equinumerous fluxes and for mixtures with the prevalence of polyethers, spinodal decomposition is detected that results in the formation of bicontinuous structures, with the characteristic domain size and spacing ranging between 5 x 10(1) - 7 X 10(1) nm and 3 X 10(2)-4 X 10(2) nm, respectively. The method is shown to produce films with tunable wettability and biologically nonfouling properties.

AB Phototransistors based on organic photoactive materials combine tunable light absorption in the spectral region from Ultraviolet to near-infrared with low-temperature process ability over large areas on flexible substrates. However, they often exhibit low photoresponsivity because of low molar extinction coefficient of photoactive components. We report a simple, yet highly efficient solution method for enhancing the performance of organic phototransistors using ruthenium complex 1 (Ru-complex 1). An air-stable n-type organic semiconductor, N,Ni-bis(2-phenyl ethyl)-perylane-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (BPE-PTCDI), has been deposited on a silicon wafer and a transparent polyimide (PI) substrate vacuum. The BPE-PTCDI phototransistors functionalized with Ru-complex 1 exhibit similar to 5000 times higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) than that of pristine BPE-PTCDI phototransistors, owing to the metal ligand charge transfer (MLCT) from Ru-complex 1, to the active component of the device. In addition, a large 10 X 10 phototransistor array (2.5 X 2.5 cm(2)) has been prepared on a transparent PI substrate, showing distinct light mapping. The fabricated phototransistor array is highly flexible and twistable and works well under tensile and compressive strains. We believe that our simple method will pave a viable way for improvements in the photoresponsivity of organic semiconductors for applications in wearable organic optoelectronic devices.

AB Many advanced technologies have relied on the availability of single crystals of appropriate material such as silicon for microelectronics or superalloys for turbine blades. Similarly, many promising materials could unleash their full potential if they were available in a single crystal form. However, the current methods are unsuitable for growing single crystals of these oftentimes incongruently melting, unstable or metastable materials. Here we demonstrate a strategy to overcome this hurdle by avoiding the gaseous or liquid phase, and directly converting glass into a single crystal. Specifically, Sb2S3 single crystals are grown in Sb-S-I glasses as an example of this approach. In this first unambiguous demonstration of an all-solid-state glass. crystal transformation, extraneous nucleation is avoided relative to crystal growth via spatially localized laser heating and inclusion of a suitable glass former in the composition. The ability to fabricate patterned single-crystal architecture on a glass surface is demonstrated, providing a new class of micro-structured substrate for low cost epitaxial growth, active planar devices, etc.

AB In this study, we have synthesized TiO2 nanorods (NRs) on silicon and porous silicon (PS) substrates by hydrothermal method. The PS substrates with different porosities were fabricated by electrochemical anodization on silicon. According to the field emission electron microscopy images, TiO2 NRs grown on PS substrates have a better growth compared to those grown on silicon. Also increasing substrate porosity leads to an increase in density of the NRs. Atomic force microscopy observation demonstrates that porous layer formation due to etching of silicon surface leads to an increase of its roughness. Results indicate surface roughness evolution with porosity increasing enhances TiO2 nucleation on substrate and thus increases TiO2 NRs density. We propose a growth mechanism to explain how we can control the local surface chemical potential and thus the nucleation and alignment of TiO2 NRs by surface roughness variation. Also, photoluminescence studies show a red-shift in band gap energy of NRs compared to that of common bulk TiO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The nanoscale engineering of silicon can significantly change its bulk optoelectronic properties to make it more favorable for device integration. Phonon process engineering is one way to enhance inter-band transitions in silicon's indirect band structure alignment. This paper demonstrates phonon localization at the tip of silicon nanowires fabricated by galvanic displacement using wet electroless chemical etching of a bulk silicon wafer. High-resolution Raman micro-spectroscopy reveals that such arrayed structures of silicon nanowires display phonon localization behaviors, which could help their integration into the future generations of nano-engineered silicon nanowire-based devices such as photodetectors and solar cells.

AB This paper presents a dislocation and saturation of current density analysis by varying the amount of rear-side Al. The fabrication process optimizes an aluminum-alloyed emitter using a screen printing number and varying the co-firing on n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers using a suitable industry method. N-type silicon materials have high diffusion-lengths due to the reduced recombination activities of metal impurities and other nonmetallic defects compared with p-type silicon and this fulfills the requirement for innovative solar cells. To utilize the advantage of the n-type silicon wafers for manufacturing simple and industrially feasible high-efficiency solar cells, we adopted screen-printing and co-firing of aluminum (Al) alloyed n(+)n p(+) solar cells featuring a rear Al-p(+) emitter easily fabricated through the screen-printing process. We achieved a back surface field (BSF) that was 7 mu m in thickness by applying 13.14 mg/cm(2) of Al paste in by printing on both sides and heating the material in an high temperature infra-red (IR) furnace at a peak temperature of 756.5 degrees C. In the furnace, the temperature increased at a rate of 70.82 degrees C/sec with an efficiency of 17.36%, saturation current density J(01) of 7.16 x 10(-9) mA/cm(2) and J(02) of 3.55 x 10(-5) mA/cm(2), respectively.

AB Due to its abundance, scalability, and nontoxicity, Cu2O has attracted extensive attention toward solar energy conversion, and it is the best performing metal oxide material. Until now, the high efficiency devices are all planar in structure, and their photocurrent densities still fall well below the theoretical value of 14.5 mA cm(-2) due to the incompatible light absorption and charge carrier diffusion lengths. Nanowire structures have been considered as a rational and promising approach to solve this issue, but due to various challenges, performance improvements through the use of nanowires have rarely been achieved. In this work, we develop a new synthetic method to grow Cu2O nanowire arrays on conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates with well-controlled phase and excellent electronic and photonic properties. Also, we introduce an innovative blocking layer strategy to enable high performance. Further, through material engineering by combining a conformal nanoscale p-n junction, durable protective overlayer, and uniform catalyst decoration, we have successfully fabricated Cu2O nanowire array photocathodes for hydrogen generation from solar water splitting delivering unprecedentedly high photocurrent densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and stable operation beyond 50 h, establishing a new benchmark for metal oxide based photoelectrodes.

TI Use of antireflection layers to avoid ghost plating on Ni/Cu plated
   crystalline silicon solar cells
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS

AB Screen printing is a method commonly used for making electrodes for crystalline silicon solar cells. Although the screen-printing method is fast and easy, screen-printed electrodes have a porous structure, high contact resistance, and low aspect ratio. On the other hand, plated electrodes have low contact resistance and narrow electrode width. Therefore, the plating method could be substituted for the screen-printing method in crystalline silicon solar cells. During the plating process, ghost plating can appear at the surface when the quality of the passivation layer is poor, causing an increase in the recombination rate. In this paper, light-induced plating was applied to the fabrication of electrodes, and various passivation layers were investigated to remove ghost plating in crystalline silicon solar cells. These included, (1) SiNx deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), (2) a double SiNx layer formed by PECVD, (3) a double layer with thermal silicon oxide and SiNx deposited by PECVD, and (4) a double layer comprising SiNx and SiOx formed by PECVD. For the plated solar cells, a laser was used to remove various antireflection coating (ARC) layers and phosphoric acid was spin-coated onto the doped silicon wafer prior to laser ablation. Also, a screen-printed solar cell was fabricated to compare plated solar cells with screen-printed solar cells. As a result, we found that a thermal SiO2/PECVD SiNx layer showed the lowest pinhole density and its wet vapor transmission rate was characterized. The solar cell with the thermal SiO2/PECVD SiNx layer showed the lowest J(02) value, as well as improved V-oc and J(sc). (C) 2016 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB Sonochemistry offers a simple route to nanomaterial synthesis with the application of ultrasound. The tiny acoustic bubbles, produced by the propagating sound wave, enclose an incredible facility where matter interact among at energy as high as 13 eV to spark extraordinary chemical reactions. Within each period - formation, growth and collapse of bubbles, lies a coherent phase of material formation. This effective yet highly localized method has facilitated synthesis of various chemical and biological compounds featuring unique morphology and intrinsic property. The benign processing lends to synthesis without any discrimination towards a certain group of material, or the substrates where they are grown. As a result, new and improved applications have evolved to reach out various field of science and technology and helped engineer new and better devices. Along with the facile processing and notes on the essence of sonochemistry, in this comprehensive review, we discuss the individual and mutual effect of important input parameters on the nanomaterial synthesis process as a start to help understand the underlying mechanism. Secondly, an objective discussion of the diversely synthesized nanomaterial follows to divulge the easiness imparted by sonochemistry, which finally blends into the discussion of their applications and outreach.

AB A method of fabricating anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) with the capability of manipulating its stored charge is reported. This method involves the use of a pulsed current source to anodise aluminium layers instead of the typically used constant current/voltage source, with the test structures experiencing positive and negative cycles periodically. By tuning the positive cycle percentage, it is demonstrated that the effective stored charge density can be manipulated in a range from -5.2 x 10(11) to 2.5 x 10(12) q/cm(2) when the AAO is formed over a 12 nm SiO2 layer. An investigation of the stored charge distribution in the dielectric stacks indicates a positive fixed charge at the SiO2/Si interface, a negative fixed charge at the AAO/SiO2 interface and a positive bulk charge within the AAO layer. The effective stored charge density and interface states were found to be affected by annealing conditions and it is suggested that oxygen annealing can reduce the bulk positive charge while post-metallisation anneal is most effective in reducing silicon interface defects. Charge manipulation using pulsed anodisation is shown to reduce carrier recombination on boron-diffused silicon surfaces highlighting the potential of the process to be used to tune the electrical properties of dielectric layers so that they can reduce surface recombination on silicon surfaces having different dopant polarity and concentrations.

AB Planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell promises low cost solution manufactured solar cells with the efficiency of single crystal silicon cells. However, it is still a great challenge to fabricate high quality perovskite films by solution method. Here, we demonstrate a simple method to control the morphology of perovskite film deposited on the top of a PEDOT: PSS coated ITO glass. The key to the process is to induce a change at the stage of the nucleation of intermediate phase, leading to the homogenous high density nucleation of the particles without preferred orientation instead of the sparse nucleation of the needle shaped crystals by a solvent treatment using a solvent which is miscible with the solvent of the perovskite precursor solution, but less soluble to the precursors of PbI2 and CH3NH3I. The morphology of the intermediate phase determines the morphology of final perovskite film. Planar inverted heterojunction perovskite solar cells fabricated using the perovskite films deposited by the method as the absorb layer show a reproducible efficiency of 13.1%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Selective-area nanopillar-textured solar cells were fabricated by using a convenient method to overcome the problem of metal contacts on the nanopillars surfaces. A Ti/Ag electrode layer was deposited onto the planar surface after phosphorous doping, and then the nanopillars were fabricated on the surface by using cesium chloride (CsCl) self-assembly lithography. With this method, nanopillars of approximately 150 nm average diameter and heights from 120 to 480 nm [corresponding inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching time from 15 to 75s] were fabricated on silicon surface as an antireflection layer. Compared with the solar cell with nanopillar arrays covering the entire front surface, the selective-area nanopillars device exhibited better electrode contacts, and consequently better performance: the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) improved from 12.38 to 15.58%. The heights of the nanopillars also had a significant effect on the PCE of the solar cells, for which the nanopillars of 240 nm height produced the solar cell with the best performance.

AB An effective light trapping method for substrate-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film solar cells is the use of a back reflector (BR) of high roughness, e.g., 'hot silver', which is deposited at temperatures higher than 450 degrees C. In this work, textured silver-aluminum (Ag-Al) BR films were fabricated by depositing Ag on Al film at Ag-deposition temperatures (T-Ag) ranging from 25 to 350 degrees C. The surface morphology and roughness of Ag-Al films were strongly affected by T-Ag. The Al and Ag films were formed entirely of Ag2Al alloy at T-Ag of 330 degrees C or higher, while the Ag-Al films maintained a double-layered structure at 290 degrees C or below. Although the films did not undergo alloying at T-Ag of 290 degrees C, the Ag-Al films have a well-developed surface structure with high diffuse-reflectance, compared to Ag films deposited at the same temperature. The conversion efficiency of an a-Si:H thin film solar cell on a flexible stainless steel substrate increased from 7.63% to 8.44% as T-Ag was increased from 25 to 290 degrees C, as a result of more effective light scattering by Ag-Al BRs, producing increased short-circuit current. However, at higher TAg, Ag-Al alloy films with sharp crystallite edges were formed, and were not appropriate as BRs. The present work clearly shows that double-layered Ag-Al films fabricated at temperatures as low as 290 degrees C could be useful back reflectors for substrate-type thin film solar cells.

AB Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising low-cost alternative to silicon-based photovoltaic solar cells. Thus, this study was initiated with the aim of combining the unique physical and chemical properties of both SWCNTs and metal oxide nanostructures (such as ZnO-NR) for assembling novel building blocks for solar cells and light energy harvesting devices. DSSCs based on ZnO nanorods/single-walled carbon nanotubes (ZnO-NR/SWCNT) nanocomposite were prepared by the hydrothermal and spin coating method. The photoelectric performances of the DSSCs with various SWCNT loadings up to 1.00 wt% were compared. A gradual increase in the power conversion efficiency (eta) was observed up to SWCNT loading of 0.50 wt%, at which the power conversion efficiency of fabricated cells increased to 3.4% compared to 1.97% without SWCNTs. However, further increases in SWCNTs loadings significantly reduced cell performance. Furthermore, the maximum dye absorption intensity was attained at the SWCNT loading of 0.50 wt%. Compared to the DSSC with ZnO-NR electrode, the photocurrent voltage (J-V) characteristics of the DSSC with 0.50 wt% SWCNTs loading showed an increase in the short-circuit photocurrent (J(sc)) of 38% leading to an increase in (eta) by a factor of approximately 1.7.

AB CdS/Si multi-interface nanoheterojunction has been fabricated by depositing CdS nanocrystals (nc-CdS) on the silicon nanoporous pillar array (Si-NPA) using a chemical bath deposition method. Utilizing the reducibility of Si-NPA, Cd nanocrystals (nc-Cd) are incorporated into the Si-CdS interface. The structures of CdS/Si multi-interface nanoheterojunction with incorporation of nc-Cd into the interface (CdS:Cd/Si-NPA) has been concluded. The upper layer is a continuous CdS thin film, the intermediate layer is the interface region constructed by randomly and alternately dispersed nc-CdS and nc-Si with small amount of nc-Cd, and the bottom layer is the unfilled silicon nanoporous layer grown on sc-Si substrate. An obvious photovoltaic effect is observed in the prototype photovoltaic device based on CdS:Cd/Si-NPA. Compared with the previous work, the increased energy conversion efficiency has been ascribed to the incorporation of nc-Cd into the Si-CdS interface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A nanoforest of black silicon was prepared using a method combining aluminum-induced crystallization (AIC) and reactive-ion etching (RIE). During the AIC period, a rough layer, incorporating AISix intermetallics, was formed. This layer acted as an etch mask for the RIE step. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed to further analyze the formation of black silicon. Compared to Si3N4 and polysilicon, the black silicon exhibits a high degree of infrared absorption for wavelengths of about 3 to 5 mu m and 8 to 14 mu m, respectively. In addition, black platinum overlaid on the base of black silicon further improves the infrared absorption. This nanostructure forests of black silicon could be incorporated into the fabrication process for gas detectors, photovoltaic devices, and imaging applications to improve the infrared absorption characteristics.

AB Nanostructured silicon hybrid solar cells are promising candidates for a new generation photovoltaics because of their light-trapping abilities and solution processes. However, the performance of hybrid organic/Si nanostructure solar cells is hindered because of carrier recombination at surface and poor coverage of organic material poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PE-DOT:PSS) on nanostructures. Here we demonstrate low-pressure-assisted coating method of PEDOT:PSS on surface modified silicon nanotips with broadband light-trapping characteristics to improve interface property and to achieve high-efficiency hybrid solar cells through a solution process. The approach enhances the effective minority-carrier lifetime and the coverage of PEDOT:PSS on the surface of nanostructures. Hybrid solar cells fabricated with surface-modified nanotips exhibit a high fill factor of 70.94%, short-circuit current density of 35.36 mA/cm(2), open-circuit voltage of 0.528 V, and power conversion efficiency of 13.36%. The high efficiency and the high fill factor are achieved because of conformal coating of PEDOT:PSS via a low-pressure-assisted coating process, excellent light harvesting without sacrificing the minority-carrier lifetime, and efficient charge separation/collection of photogenerated carriers.

AB Over the past years significant focus has been given on fabricating nanomaterials with unique shapes and structures. This article presents a new configuration for Si nanoparticles that have a hollow structure, whose shell contains mesopores. These structures were obtained through a simple chemical method by using SiCl4 with Zn as the reactant and solvent. The coupling effects between the buoyancy, surface tension, and diffusion of ZnCl2 are responsible for the formation of the hollow structures, with a high production rate and quality. Characterization of the resulting powders, through X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, illustrated that the diameter of the hollow Si nanospheres ranged from 150 nm to 300 nm, while nitrogen adsorption and density functional theory calculations indicated that their surface area was 193.498 m(2)/g and mesopores 2-4 nm in diameter existed in their shell.

AB In this paper, we report quasi-inverted nanopyramids (QIP) for light-trapping in ultrathin c-Si by a cost-effective wet chemical method. The QIP is fabricated by a well-known two-step Ag assisted chemical etching method followed by a post nanostructure rebuilding (NSR) process, lowering the surface area to similar to 3.0 times for suppressing surface recombination losses. The comparable average absorptance value of 43 mm c-Si with double-sided QIP to that of 182 mm c-Si with double-sided conventional pyramid in the spectral range of 300-1100 nm demonstrates an over 4.2-fold reduction in material usage. Finally, a simulation model is proposed to explain the superiority of our QIP compared with the periodic inverted pyramid (IP) structure of the same size, presenting a promising method to the mass production of high-efficiency ultrathin c-Si HIT solar cells.

AB Silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) have been fabricated at wafer-scale with Au nanoparticles as catalysts at 500 degrees C using a chemical-vapor- deposition (CVD) method combined with a high-speed rotation wafer-disk. High resolution TEM and SAED patterns were used to characterize the microstructures of the grown Si-NWs. Single crystalline Si-NWs appear self-oriented on Si (100) substrates along the < 111 > growth axis. The nanowires have a uniform diameter of 50 nm and varying lengths and densities depending on the rotation speed of the wafer substrate. The effects of wafer-rotation speed on the growth of Si-NWs are discussed. Due to a reduced boundary layer thickness, fast mass transport leads to both an enhanced growth rate and density of the Si-NWs. Moreover, the density of the Si-NW array is optimized to achieve a low reflectance loss for their further application in tandem solar cells as the light-trapping layer.

AB Developing highly efficient perovskite solar cells in a simple and rapid fashion will open the window for their potential commercialization. Semi-transparent devices are of great interest due to their attractive application in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). In this study, efficient perovskite solar cells with good transparency in the visible wavelength range have been developed by a facile and low-temperature PCBM-assisted perovskite growth method. This method results in the formation of a perovskite-PCBM hybrid material at the grain boundaries which is observed by EELS mapping and confirmed by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, transient photocurrent (TP) measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PCBM-assisted perovskite growth method involves fewer steps and therefore is less expensive and time consuming than other similar methods. The semitransparent solar cells developed using this method exhibited power conversion efficiency (PCE) ranging from 12% to 4% depending on the average visible transmittance (AVT) ranging from 3% to 35%. The as-fabricated semitransparent perovskite solar cell with an active layer thickness of only about 150 nm, which is only less than half the active layer thickness of a typical perovskite solar cell, provided a PCE as high as 9.1% with an AVT of 18% and more than 12% with an AVT of 3%.

AB In this paper, we have demonstrated a simple and cost effective HF-vapor phase etching method to fabricate the broadband quasi-omnidirectional antireflective surface on glass substrate. Both-sides etched sodalime glass substrates under optimized conditions showed a broadband enhancement in the transmittance spectra with maximum transmittance as high as similar to 97% at 598 nm. FESEM results confirmed the formation of a graded nanoporous surface, which lowers it refractive index. The etched surface exhibited excellent AR property over a wide range of incidence angles (8 degrees-48 degrees), which is attributed due to the formation of graded porosity. Silicon solar cell covered with plain glass showed Isc of 0.123A and efficiency of 8.76%, while it showed I-sc of 0.130A and efficiency of 9.2% when it was covered by etched glass. Furthermore, it exhibited an excellent anti-soiling property as compared to plain glass. All these results show its strong potential in the photovoltaic application.

AB Patterning is fundamental to advancing most technologies. Although the challenge for electronic integrated circuits continues to be reduced feature size other applications have different requirements and challenges. This review contributes insights from silicon photovoltaics where patterning is required for selective doping etching and metallisation. Earlier silicon solar cell devices extensively used optical lithography to fabricate devices in the laboratory with high device efficiencies being achieved. However industrial cell fabrication has largely relied on uniformly doped silicon layers and lower resolution screen-printing for metal electrode formation because optical lithography is considered too expensive and slow. This has resulted in the average energy conversion efficiencies of industrially produced cells remaining on average 5% lower than the value of 25% reported in 1999 for cells patterned with optical lithography. Motivated by the goal of bridging this efficiency gap many new polymer patterning methods which do not require the formation of a qualified mask have been developed for different silicon solar cell designs. These polymer patterning methods fall into two general classes; (i) where the polymer mask is directly printed on the cell surface; and (ii) where a pattern is formed in a polymer layer using printers or lasers to effect the patterning. Many of the methods which are reviewed in this paper although developed with specific photovoltaic requirements in mind may also find applications in other fields of research and technology.

AB In this work, a simple method to form small random pyramid texturing (0.5-2 mu m size) is proposed to enhance the surface passivation of commercial p-type Cz-Si wafers. Small pyramid texturing was generated with chemical nano-masking for anisotropic etching. The surface recombination velocity obtained after the passivation of the thermal oxide layer reduced from 65 and 10 cm s(-1) for the large pyramids (10-15 mu m size) and small pyramid (0.5-2 mu m) texturing respectively. The solar cell fabricated with large pyramid texturing resulted in an efficiency of 17.82% with a current density (J(SC)) of 36.91 mA cm(-2), an open circuit voltage (V-OC) of 620 mV whereas small pyramid texturing resulted in an efficiency of 18.5% with J(SC) of 37.6 mA cm(-2) and V-OC of 628 mV. The low surface recombination velocity increases the V-OC by 8 mV. The small pyramid textured wafers are found to enhance the quantum efficiency performance in both short and long wavelength regions.

AB A new type of n-p-n transistor photovoltaic device based on CdS/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT)/n-Si configuration was fabricated in a facile process. CdS quantum dots were deposited on fluorine-doped tin-oxide glass using a chemical bath deposition method, and MWNT film was coated on n-type Si substrate by airbrushing. The materials used for the n-p-n transistor solar cells were characterized by multiple techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman, Ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer, and I-V characteristic measurements. The CdS layer acts as a good n-type material for the transistor solar cells. The thickness of the CdS layer can be controlled by the chemical bath deposition time to achieve different photovoltaic responses. I-V characteristic measurements show that the efficiency increases with increasing the thickness of the CdS thin layer. Compared with the tandem solar cells based on (p/n)-(p/n) semiconductor junctions, our n-p-n transistor solar cell has a simple structure without using tunnel junctions or wafer bonding schemes for interconnecting the cells.

AB Organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) are currently under the spotlight as promising materials for new generation low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell technology. Within a few years of intensive research, the solar energy-to-electricity power conversion efficiency (PCE) based on OHP materials has rapidly increased to a level that is on par with that of even the best crystalline silicon solar cells. However, there is plenty of room for further improvements. In particular, the development of protocols to make such a technology applicable to industry is of paramount importance. Vapor based methods show particular potential in fabricating uniform semitransparent perovskite films across large areas. In this article, we review the recent progress of OHP thin-film fabrication based on vapor based deposition techniques. We discuss the instrumentation and specific features of each vapor-based method as well as its corresponding device performance. In the outlook, we outline the vapor deposition related topics that warrant further investigation.

AB Bottom-up, chemical methods to control the morphology of semiconductor nanostructures are a promising complement to the top-down fabrication techniques that currently dominate the semiconductor industry. Among bottom-up techniques, nanowire (NW) growth using the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism has received great attention. In this Highlight article, we review our recent progress toward understanding the microscopic processes that govern VLS NW growth, doping, and dopant modulation. Quantitative measurements of Si NW growth rates and P dopant profiles under a range of synthetic conditions are interpreted with a kinetic analysis of VLS growth that includes the microscopic reactions of incorporation, evaporation, and crystallization. The analysis allows us to identify synthetic conditions that yield both diameter-independent growth rates and abrupt, diameter-independent dopant transitions. The optimized conditions allow precise, sub-10 nm morphology to be encoded along the growth axis of Si NWs, enabling the bottom-up chemical nanofabrication of complex structures that are typically fabricated by high-resolution, top-down lithography.

SO ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

ID CONTACT RESISTANCE; MISMATCH LOSSES; ARRAYS
AB Industrial wafer-silicon (Si) solar cells fabricated under nominally-identical process conditions on similar-quality wafers have efficiencies spreading over a wide range. This efficiency dispersion significantly increases the cost of Si photovoltaic (PV) systems. Cell efficiency uniformization, i.e. all the cells come out within a small range of a target efficiency, is critical for low-cost Si PV. In this work, Si cell parameters susceptible to process and material variations are investigated by numerical simulation to evaluate their effects on cell efficiency, including emitter diffusion temperature, wafer resistivity and minority carrier lifetime, front electrode width and height, and antireflection layer thickness. The most popular industrial Si cell structure is established in simulation for this study. As the emitter diffusion temperature affects its contact resistivity, sheet resistance, and recombination, these parameters are isolated to reveal their individual effect on cell efficiency. Resistive losses in the emitter are identified as the primary reason for the efficiency dispersion. It is found that a narrow efficiency range of +/- 0.5% absolute can be achieved if the emitter diffusion temperature is confined to a 13 degrees C window, while other parameters vary within their normal windows. Possible methods to minimize temperature variation in emitter diffusion are proposed. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB The opportunity for substantial efficiency enhancements of thin film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) solar photovoltaic (PV) cells using plasmonic absorbers requires ultra-thin transparent conducting oxide top electrodes with low resistivity and high transmittances in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Fabricating ultra-thin indium tin oxide (ITO) films (sub-50 nm) using conventional methods has presented a number of challenges; however, a novel method involving chemical shaving of thicker (greater than 80 nm) RF sputter deposited high-quality ITO films has been demonstrated. This study investigates the effect of oxygen concentration on the etch rates of RF sputter deposited ITO films to provide a detailed understanding of the interaction of all critical experimental parameters to help create even thinner layers to allow for more finely tune plasmonic resonances. ITO films were deposited on silicon substrates with a 98-nm, thermally grown oxide using RF magnetron sputtering with oxygen concentrations of 0, 0.4 and 1.0 sccm and annealed at 300 degrees C air ambient. Then the films were etched using a combination of water and hydrochloric and nitric acids for 1, 3, 5 and 8 min at room temperature. In-between each etching process cycle, the films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, 4-point probe (electrical conductivity), and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. All the films were polycrystalline in nature and highly oriented along the (222) reflection. Ultra-thin ITO films with record low resistivity values (as low as 5.83 x 10(-4) Omega-cm) were obtained and high optical transparency is exhibited in the 300-1000 nm wavelength region for all the ITO films. The etch rate, preferred crystal lattice growth plane, d-spacing and lattice distortion were also observed to be highly dependent on the nature of growth environment for RF sputter deposited ITO films. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of the ITO films are discussed with respect to the oxygen ambient nature and etching time in detail to provide guidance for plasmonic enhanced a-Si: H solar PV cell fabrication.

AB We report on fabrication of organic-inorganic perovskite thin films using a hybrid method consisting of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of lead iodide and spin-coating of methylammonium iodide. Smooth and highly crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 thin films have been fabricated on silicon and glass coated substrates with fluorine doped tin oxide using this PLD-based hybrid method. Planar perovskite solar cells with an inverted structure have been successfully fabricated using the perovskite films. Because of its versatility, the PLD-based hybrid fabrication method not only provides an easy and precise control of the thickness of the perovskite thin films, but also offers a straightforward platform for studying the potential feasibility in using other metal halides and organic salts for formation of the organic-inorganic perovskite structure.

AB In this paper, the interface between Si nanoholes (SiNHs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is investigated and improved to achieve high-efficiency SiNH/PEDOT: PSS hybrid solar cells. The high-density SiNHs are fabricated using short-time Ag deposition before metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) method. Also, a polymer coverage method is explored to overcome the difficulty of PEDOT: PSS infiltration into SiNHs. PEDOT: PSS is mixed with co-solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to have better polymer infiltrate into SiNHs via two-step coating process. This technique significantly improves the interface between SiNHs and PEDOT: PSS; the greatly reduced contact angle from 90 degrees to 16 degrees at the interface of Si and PEDOT: PSS has established this fact. In addition, the minority carrier lifetime is dramatically increased from 31.52 to 317.20 ms. The property improvement enables the SiNH/PEDOT: PSS hybrid solar cell with high J(sc) of 36.80 mA cm(-2), V-oc of 0.524 V, FF of 66.50%, and thus PCE of 12.82%. Also, the SiNH structures have an excellent light-trapping effect, which contributes to very low average total reflectance of 3%, due to internal multiple reflections caused by subwavelength features. At an angle of incidence up to 60 degrees, the specular reflectance maintains at as low as 1%; even at a large angle of 70 degrees, the reflectance is still below 10%. This work provides a feasible solution process to fabricate SiNH structure and to improve organic/Si hybrid solar cells in energy and cost-effective manner.

AB A semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) interlayer between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and n-Si was used for high performance organic-Si hybrid photoVoltaic (PV) devices. The s-SWCNTs films with different thickness were utilized to investigate the PV effect on PEDOT:PSS/Si device performance. The surface potential of Si substrate with s-SWCNTs was dramatically reduced, which increased the compatibility between Si and PEDOT:PSS. In addition, s-SWCNTs with good semiconducting properties, guaranteed the charge transfer between Si and PEDOT:PSS. Therein, the electrical contact was dramatically improved with addition of s-SWCNTs interlayer, which led to increased fill factor. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.14% was achieved with an optimized thickness of s-SWCNTs layer. The s-SWCNTs interface layer was fabricated by a simple solution processed method, which was easily coupled with organic-Si solar cells to enhance the PCE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work approaches the problem of increasing the growth rate of device quality a-Si:H by using the simplest case, a standard RF-PECVD system and pure silane as feedstock gas. Starting from plasma conditions which provided a high-quality material at very lowdeposition rates, the silane flow and the applied power (RFP) were proportionally increased. As a result, the growth rate showed an almost linear increase with the RFP. An exhaustive analysis of the material obtained revealed the existence of a wide window in which the structural/optoelectronic properties remain unchanged. Within this window, a-Si:H p-i-n solar cells were fabricated in order to verify the applicability of the procedure proposed to the development of device structures. The initial results showed an excellent behaviour of the solar cells at higher growth rates, without any relevant detriment in the collection capability and fill factor. Thus, the constant power-to-flow ratio is presented as an easy and reliable method to reduce the deposition time which, additionally, could be applied to any variant of plasma CVD system.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) sheets have a strong tendency to aggregate, and their interfaces can impose limitations on the electrical conductivity, which would hinder practical applications. Here, we present a blown bubble film method to assemble GO sheets with a uniform distribution over a large area and further interconnect individual GO sheets by transforming the bubble film into graphitized carbon. A conventional polymer was used to facilitate the bubble blowing process and disperse GO sheets in the bubble. Then, the bubble film was annealed on a Cu substrate, resulting in a highly transparent reduced GO (RGO) carbon hybrid structure consisting of RGO patches well adhered to the carbon film. We fabricated RGO carbon/Si solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 6.42%, and the assembled RGO patches hybridized with carbon film can form an effective junction with Si, indicating potential applications in thin film electronic devices and photovoltaics.

DE Al nanoparticle arrays; surface plasmon; solar cells; light-trapping
ID METAL NANOPARTICLES
AB Metal nanoparticles with low cost and high performance have good potential applications in light-trapping of solar cells. In this paper, a three-dimensional model is proposed to simulate the light absorption of microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si: H) thin film solar cells. The effects of spherical and hemispherical Al nanoparticle arrays located on the front surfaces of solar cells are investigated, and the particle radius and array period are optimized by the finite element method. The results show that the optimal Al nanoparticle arrays can enhance broadband absorption in thin film solar cells. For spherical particle arrays, the key parameter that influences light absorption in solar cells is period/radius ratio (P / R) or particle surface coverage. When P / R = 4-5, the optimum integrated absorption enhancement (E-abs) is over 20% under AM1.5 illumination compared with the solar cell without nanoparticles. The value of E-abs is small and decreases with the increase of P / R when P / R > 5, and E-abs is less than zero when P / R < 3 because of the parasitic absorption and backward scattering from the mental nanoparticles. When P = 5 00 nm and R = 1 20 nm, the spectral absorption rate as a function of wavelength shows broadband absorption including four distinct peaks, which are attributed to quadrupole plasmon resonance mode, dipole resonance mode and waveguide mode respectively according to the electric field distribution in the solar cell. For hemispherical particle arrays, the maximum value of E-abs is 24.5%, which is higher than that of the solar cell with optimized spherical particle arrays. This is due to the high coupling efficiencies of the particles, so that most of the scattered light is directly coupled into the substrate. However, the value of E-abs is very sensitive to the hemispherical particle radius. As the radius decreases, the scattering cross-section and scattering efficiency of the particle decrease dramatically. As the radius increases, the dipole plasmon resonance wavelength rapidly shifts towards longer wavelength (red shift). Both of these are detrimental to absorption enhancement of solar cells. Thus we conclude that spherical Al particle arrays are more preferable in actually fabricating the light-trapping of solar cells.

AB Laser speckle pattern is a granular structure formed due to random coherent wavelet interference and generally considered as noise in optical systems including photolithography. Contrary to this, in this paper, we use the speckle pattern to generate predictable and controlled Gaussian random structures and quasi-random structures photo-lithographically. The random structures made using this proposed speckle lithography technique are quantified based on speckle statistics, radial distribution function (RDF) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). The control over the speckle size, density and speckle clustering facilitates the successful fabrication of black silicon with different surface structures. The controllability and tunability of randomness makes this technique a robust method for fabricating predictable 2D Gaussian random structures and black silicon structures. These structures can enhance the light trapping significantly in solar cells and hence enable improved energy harvesting. Further, this technique can enable efficient fabrication of disordered photonic structures and random media based devices.

AB This work demonstrates the fabrication of silicide/silicon based solar cell towards the development of low cost and environmental friendly photovoltaic technology. A heterostructure solar cells using metallic alpha phase (alpha-phase) aluminum alloyed iron silicide (FeSi(Al)) on n-type silicon is fabricated with an efficiency of 0.8%. The fabricated device has an open circuit voltage and fill-factor of 240 mV and 60%, respectively. Performance of the device was improved by about 7 fold to 5.1% through the interface engineering. The alpha-phase FeSi(Al)/silicon solar cell devices have promising photovoltaic characteristic with an open circuit voltage, short-circuit current and a fill factor (FF) of 425 mV, 18.5 mA/cm(2), and 64%, respectively. The significant improvement of alpha-phase FeSi(Al)/n-Si solar cells is due to the formation p(+-)n homojunction through the formation of re-grown crystalline silicon layer (similar to 5-10 nm) at the silicide/silicon interface. Thickness of the regrown silicon layer is crucial for the silicide/silicon based photovoltaic devices. Performance of the alpha-FeSi(Al)/n-Si solar cells significantly depends on the thickness of alpha-FeSi(Al) layer and process temperature during the device fabrication. This study will open up new opportunities for the Si based photovoltaic technology using a simple, sustainable, and los cost method.

AB Silicon nitride coating deposited by the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method is the most widely used antireflection coating for crystalline silicon solar cells. In this work, we employed double-layered silicon nitride coating consisting of a top layer with a lower refractive index and a bottom layer (contacting the silicon wafer) with a higher refractive index for multicrystalline silicon solar cells. An optimization procedure was presented for maximizing the photovoltaic performance of the encapsulated solar cells or modules. The dependence of their photovoltaic properties on the thickness of silicon nitride coatings was carefully analyzed. Desirable thicknesses of the individual silicon nitride layers for the double-layered coatings were calculated. In order to get statistical conclusions, we fabricated a large number of multicrystalline silicon solar cells using the standard production line for both the double-layered and single-layered antireflection coating types. On the cell level, the double-layered silicon nitride antireflection coating resulted in an increase of 0.21%, absolute for the average conversion efficiency, and 1.8 mV and 0.11 mA/cm(2) for the average open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density, respectively. On the module level, the cell to module power transfer factor was analyzed, and it was demonstrated that the double-layered silicon nitride antireflection coating provided a consistent enhancement in the photovoltaic performance for multicrystalline silicon solar cell modules than the single-layered silicon nitride coating.

AB Herein, we report the growth and characterization of Sn-doped ZnO nanowires on silicon substrate by noncatalytic facile thermal evaporation process. The grown nanowires were further characterized in terms of their structural, morphological and electrical properties. The detailed characterizations revealed that the nanowires are grown in high density and possessing well-crystallinity and wurtzite hexagonal phase. To examine the electrical properties, a heterojunction diode based on n-Sn-doped ZnO/p-Si assembly was fabricated. The electrical properties of the fabricated heterojunction diode were examined at low temperature range (77 K-295 K) in both the forward and reverse bias conditions. The study of low temperature dependence of current-voltage characteristics of the heterojunction diode shows that both the quality factor and Schottky barrier height depend on temperature. However, adopting a simple approach that uses a Gaussian distribution of barrier heights, the mean barrier height of similar to 0.73 eV, at the range of low temperatures was found and compared to that of similar to 1.2 eV obtained recently by the authors for the same diode at the range of higher temperatures from similar analysis. An apparent discrepancy found between the results of barrier height extracted from C-V analysis and those from I-V analysis is attributed to adopting different theoretical approaches based on different physical grounds.

AB A high surface area and low reflection textured surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate with plasmonic gold nanodroplets fabricated by wet etching and island lithography was reported in the present study. Specifically, four textured substrates, planar, pyramid, nanopillar, and nanopillar-on-pyramid, were fabricated. The fabricated structures were simulated using the finite-difference time-domain method and the results agreed with the reflection and dark-field scattering measurements. Although the SERS signals varied in different measured regions because of the random nanostructure, the SERS substrates with nanopillar-on-pyramid structure always have the stronger enhancement factor than the SERS substrates with only pyramids or nanopillars. Based on the atomic force microscope and reflection measurements, the nanopillar-on-pyramid structure provided a large surface area and multiple reflections for SERS enhancement, which was about 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the planar substrate. Our results can be applied to fabricate the inexpensive, large surface area, and high SERS enhancement substrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aluminium induced texture (AIT) method has been used for obtaining highly textured glass substrate suitable for silicon based thin film solar cell technology. Wet etch step parameters of AIT process have been varied and effect of different etchants and different etching times on morphological and optical properties has been analyzed. The resulting morphology features (shape, size distribution, inclination angle) have been optimized in order to obtain the best scattering properties. ZnO:Ga (GZO) films have been deposited by sputtering technique on AIT-processed glass. Two different ZnO surface morphologies have been obtained, strongly depending on the underlying glass substrate morphology induced by different etching times. Very rough and porous texture (arms 150 nm) was obtained on glass etched 2 min showing cauliflower-like structure, whereas a softer texture (arms 78 nm) was obtained on glass etched 7 min giving wider and smoother U-shaped craters. The effect of different glass textures on optical confinement has been tested in amorphous silicon based p-i-n devices. Devices fabricated on GZO/high textured glass showed a quantum efficiency enhancement due to both an effective light trapping phenomenon and an effective anti-reflective optical behaviour. Short etching time produce smaller cavities (<1 mu m) with deep U-shape characterized by high roughness, high inclination angle and low autocorrelation length. This surface morphology promoted a large light scattering phenomenon, as evidenced by haze value and by angular resolved scattering (ARS) behaviour, into a large range of diffraction angles, giving high probability of effective light trapping inside a PV device.

AB Host sensitized near-infrared emitting phosphor Na2YMg2(VO4)(3):Yb3+ was fabricated by a sol-gel method. Efficient broad emission is observed under ultraviolet excitation ranging from 240 nm to -400 nm and this luminescence originates from ligand-metal charge transfer of 2p of O2- to 3d of V5+. Under excitation of ultraviolet light in the broad absorption band, intense near-infrared emission of Yb3+-around 974 nm is observed for Yb3+ -doped Na2YMg2(VO4)(3). Through study of photoluminescence spectra, fluorescence decay curves and concentration-dependent luminescence, mechanism of energy transfer from VO4 group to Yb3+ was proposed to rationalize the downconversion process. This phosphor with performance of ultra-violet to near-infrared downconversion could have potential application in improving efficiency of silicon-based solar cell. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a novel method to improve the function of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The proposed method includes use of macro-porous silicon (PSi) as a photoanode for DSSC. The photoanode, PSi, was fabricated by a simple electrochemical anodization process. The effects of the obtained PSi-based photoanode on the DSSC performance are investigated by using photocurrent-voltage, UV-visible spectroscopy, and reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The results show that the macro-porous structure in the PSi-based photoanode not only increases internal surface area in the photoanode, but also functions as an anti-reflective/light-trapping layer. Macro-porous structure leads to the both enhancement of photoanode dye loading capacity and increasing the optical path length of the incident light inside the photoanode. This way, macro-porous structure plays an important role in the improvement of light harvesting efficiency. The optimal power conversion efficiency of 3.56 and 3.93 % (spin coated and sputtered TiO2 respectively) is obtained from the PSi-based DSSC, with 58 and 75 % improvement in the efficiency as compared to a fabricated conventional DSSC. The measurement results suggest that exploiting PSi in the structure of photoanode raises hopes for low-cost and high-performance production of hybrid Si/dye solar cells in the future.
