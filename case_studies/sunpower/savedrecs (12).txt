AB In this paper, device simulation and parameter optimization on crystalline silicon (c-Si) selective-emitter (SE) solar cell are performed by using PC2D two-dimensional simulator. On the basis of achieving perfect fitting to the measured I-V curve of a typical c-Si SE solar cell fabricated by screen printing phosphoric paste method, the effects of physical parameters of gridlines, base, selective emitter and back surface field layer on the optoelectronic performance of the SE solar cell are comprehensively and systematically investigated. Simulation results show that the base minority carrier lifetime, the front surface recombination velocity and the back surface recombination velocity are the three largest efficiency-affecting parameters. In the studied parameter range, when the base minority carrier lifetime rises from 50 mu s to 600 mu s, the cell efficiency increaes from 18.53% to 19.27%. Low front surface recombination velocity is the premise of making the optimization of selective emitter sheet resistance meaningful. To obtain an ideal efficiency, the back surface recombination velocity should be controlled to be under 500 cm/s. In addition, under different front surface recombination velocities, the maximum of cell efficiency is always achieved in a range of 50-90 Omega/square heavily doped region sheet resistance and 110-180 Omega/square lightly doped region sheet resistance. For different numbers of gridlines, when the radio of heavily doped region width to the gridline pitch equals 32%, the solar cell has the highest efficiency. Moreover, under the condition of low area radio of bas bar, increasing bus bar number appropriately can improve the efficiency. The efficiency of p-type SE solar cell reaches 20.45% after optimization.

AB In this paper, nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) were deposited on planar silicon and pyramidal silicon wafers by the magnetron sputtering method, and then these Ni NP-covered samples were etched in a hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and deionized water mixed solution at room temperature to fabricate a low reflective silicon surface. An alumina (Al2O3) film was then deposited on the surface of the as-etched pyramidal sample by atomic layer deposition to further reduce the reflectance. The morphologies and compositions of these samples were studied by using a field emission scanning electron microscope attached to an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The surface reflectance measurements were carried out with a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer in a wavelength range of 200-1100 nm. The SEM images show that the as-etched planar and pyramidal silicon samples were covered with many rhombic nanostructures and that some nanostructures on the planar silicon surface were ready to exhibit a flower-like burst. The reflectances of the as-etched planar and pyramidal silicon samples were 5.22 % and 3.21 % in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm, respectively. After being coated with a 75-nm-thick Al2O3 film, the etched pyramidal silicon sample showed an even lower reflectance of 2.37 % from 400 nm to 800 nm.

AB In this paper, we present our efforts on studying light trapping in thin-film silicon solar cells using photonic crystal (PC) based structures. Specifically, we propose a photonic backside texture combining periodic gratings and a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). The mechanisms of this integrated photonic design are theoretically studied and compared with conventional PCs. We experimentally fabricate the texture using lithographic and self-assembled method on thin-film single crystalline Si (c-Si) and micro-crystalline Si (mu c-Si) cells. We analyze the effects of the photonic textures on different cells and demonstrate the performance improvements. A numerical method is developed to explore the optimal multiscale textured surface and investigate light trapping limits in the wave optics regime. Using a detailed balance analysis, we show that it is possible to reach over 20% efficiency for 1.5 mu m Si cells through optimal device design and fabrication. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Si nanoparticles are produced from Si swarf which is a waste during slicing Si ingots to produce Si wafers for solar cell use. The beads mill method produces flake-like Si with scores of nanometers width from Si swarf. Subsequent photochemical dissolution with light longer than 560 nm wavelength in a 0.5 % HF solution results in sphere-shaped Si nanoparticles of 1-7 nm diameter. Si nanoparticles dispersed in ethanol show blue photoluminescence at similar to 400 nm (3.1 eV) under UV irradiation, indicating band-gap widening due to the quantum confinement effect. The band-gap energy of most of the Si nanoparticles is estimated to be 2.5-3.3 eV from the PL spectra, corresponding to the Si nanoparticle size of 1.9-3.2 nm. On the other hand, Si nanoparticles produced by immersion in the HF solution in the dark show much weaker blue photoluminescence. These results demonstrate that the Si dissolution reaction is greatly enhanced by photo-generated holes.

AB Silicon surface structures with excellent antireflection property arouse wide interest. Chemical and physical methods such as femtosecond, nanosecond, and picosecond laser processing, wet-chemical etching, electrochemical etching, and reactive ion etching have been developed to fabricate them. However, the methods can only produce a quasi-ordered array of sharp conical microspikes on silicon surface. In this paper, we present a method to fabricate periodic silicon antireflection surface structures using direct four-beam laser interference lithography (LIL). With 1 atm ambient atmosphere of SF6 and the laser fluence of the four beams irradiated on the silicon surface at 0.64 J cm(-2), the periodical conical spikes were generated. Changing the polarization directions of the opposite incident beam pairs in a four-beam LIL system could convert conical spikes structure into an array of holes. Antireflection in a wide spectral range was measured by a spectrophotometer from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The average reflectance of this periodic black silicon surface is less than 3.5%.

AB We have developed a mass production process of Si quantum dots using photo-induced chemical etching method with oxidation and etching agents and have investigated its optical properties. Average size of the fabricated Si quantum dots was estimated to be 2 nm. Absorption peaks of the fabricated quantum dots were observed in the short wavelength regions, e. g., 200 - 350 nm. On the other hand, in the case of raw sludge, absorption was not observed in the UV-visible wavelength regions due to the narrow energy band gap (e.g., 1.12 eV). The calculated energy band gap of fabricated Si quantum dots was calculated to be 3.5 eV by the modified Kubelka-Munk function. Blue emission peaks around 475 nm wavelengths were observed due to the quantum confinement effect. When the emission peak was fixed, two excitation peaks were observed in 340 nm and 380 nm, respectively, which seemed to be due to the energy band gap widening and/or surface coating with an ultrathin layer.

AB We report the fabrication of broadband antireflective silicon (Si) nanostructures fabricated using spin-coated silver (Ag) nanoparticles as an etch mask followed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching process. This fabrication technique is a simple, fast, cost-effective, and high-throughput method, making it highly suitable for mass production. Prior to the fabrication of Si nanostructures, theoretical investigations were carried out using a rigorous coupled-wave analysis method in order to determine the effects of variations in the geometrical features of Si nanostructures to obtain antireflection over a broad wavelength range. The Ag ink ratio and ICP etching conditions, which can affect the distribution, distance between the adjacent nanostructures, and height of the resulting Si nanostructures, were carefully adjusted to determine the optimal experimental conditions for obtaining desirable Si nanostructures for practical applications. The Si nanostructures fabricated using the optimal experimental conditions showed a very low average reflectance of 8.3%, which is much lower than that of bulk Si (36.8%), as well as a very low reflectance for a wide range of incident angles and different polarizations over a broad wavelength range of 300 to 1,100 nm. These results indicate that the fabrication technique is highly beneficial to produce antireflective structures for Si-based device applications requiring low light reflection.

The Langmiur Blodgett technique is introduced to fabricate gold nano-membranes on the photovoltaic solar cells. Textured structures on the indium tin oxide films are created with the nano-membrane, producing effective surface roughness for significantly improved light trapping. As a result, the quantum efficiency of the solar cell integrated with the nano-membrane textured indium tin oxide film is enhanced over a broadband wavelength range, which leads to a 13% enhancement on the photocurrent density and an 8% efficiency enhancement.

AB We fabricate silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) on the rear surface of thin film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) solar cells to enhance the light absorption using spin-coating Ag ink, which can produce Ag NPs by a simple, fast, and inexpensive method. Ink concentration and sintering temperature of the spin-coating Ag ink are optimized to maximize the light absorption in the solar cell by tuning the size and distribution as well as the surface coverage of the Ag NPs. The thickness of a SiNx spacer layer, which was embedded between the solar cell and the Ag NPs for electrical isolation, dependent optical properties of the solar cell is also systematically investigated. The thin film a-Si: H solar cell with a thin SiNx spacer layer and the Ag NPs showed great potential for realizing cost-effective high-efficiency solar cells. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America

ID ARRAYS; EFFICIENT
AB Surface area plays an important factor in the energy conversion performance of solar cells. It has also emerged as a critical factor in the evolution of high-performance micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and multifunctional microstructures most of which will benefit from integrated on-chip solar power. Presented here is the hierarchical fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes on non-planar 3-dimensional microstructures for enhanced performance of the photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The objective is to increase photoanode performance within a standard 1 cm(2) lateral footprint area by increasing the vertical surface area through the formation of TiO2 nanotubes on 3-D microstructures. In the interest of the seamless integration of DSCs into MEMS applications, careful attention is given to the processing methods of the 3-D surface enhanced photoanode. Bulk micromachining using wet-etching has been employed to fabricate 3-D microstructures in silicon. Anodization was used to form titania nanotubes within sputtered titanium thin films. Film quality, adhesion, and the formation of the nanotubes are discussed. Nanotubes with outer diameter dimensions of 180 nm, inner diameter of 75 nm, and heights of 340 nm on 15 mu m(2) x 15 mu m-deep micro-wells have been fabricated resulting in more than 7 times the increase in surface area over planar surfaces and a 20% reduction in surface spectral reflection.

AB Heterojunctions near infrared (NIR) photodetectors have attracted increasing research interests for their wide-ranging applications in many areas such as military surveillance, target detection, and light vision. A high-performance NIR light photodetector was fabricated by coating the methyl-group terminated Si nanowire array with plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated graphene film. Theoretical simulation based on finite element method (FEM) reveals that the AuNPs@graphene/CH3-SiNWs array device is capable of trapping the incident NIR light into the SiNWs array through SPP excitation and coupling in the AuNPs decorated graphene layer. What is more, the coupling and trapping of freely propagating plane waves from free space into the nanostructures, and surface passivation contribute to the high on-off ratio as well.

AB Solution processable inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are promising alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells because of their low cost roll-to-roll production and flexible device applications. In this work, we demonstrated that Cs2CO3 functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs-Cs2CO3) could be used as efficient electron-selective layers in inverted PSCs. Compared with Cs2CO3 buffered devices, the GQDs-Cs2CO3 buffered devices show 56% improvement in power conversion efficiency, as well as 200% enhancement in stability, due to the better electron-extraction, suppression of leakage current, and inhibition of Cs+ ion diffusion at the buffer/polymer interface by GQDs-Cs2CO3. This work provides a thermal-annealing-free, solution-processable method for fabricating electron-selective layer in inverted PSCs, which should be beneficial for the future development of high performance all-solution-processed or roll-to-roll processed PSCs.

AB Silicon (Si) nanostructures that exhibit a significantly low reflectance in ultraviolet (UV) and visible light wavelength regions are fabricated using a hydrogen etching process. The fabricated Si nanostructures have aperiodic subwavelength structures with pyramid-like morphologies. The detailed morphologies of the nanostructures can be controlled by changing the etching condition. The nanostructured Si exhibited much more reduced reflectance than a flat Si surface: an average reflectance of the nanostructured Si was approximately 6.8% in visible light region and a slight high reflectance of approximately 17% in UV region. The reflectance was further reduced in both UV and visible light region through the deposition of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) layer with a rough surface on the Si nanostructure: the reflectance can be decreased down to 2.5%. The enhancement of the antireflection properties was analyzed with a finite difference time domain simulation method.

AB We fabricate a Silicon thin film by metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEch). Generally, it is hard to make a large size silicon thin film. Here we demonstrate a low cost and simple method to lift off the silicon thin film from silicon wafer. Besides, the substrate is reusable, so we can fabricate many thin films from the same wafer. Thus, this method is competitive for commercial applications.

AB In this paper we investigate the properties of SWCNTs film-silicon vertical heterojunction fabricated by simple drop-casting method. The vertical heterojunction shows a good rectifying characteristic, which demonstrates a good Schottky contact, with a Schottky barrier height of 0.46eV. At high temperature, thermionic emission is the dominant transport mechanism, while tunneling begins to lead below 220K. I-V curve of the vertical heterojunction obeys exponential and power function at low and high voltage respectively. Compared to others, our device show better properties both at forward and reverse voltage, which may result from the thick SWCNTs film and directly film deposition method at high temperature.

AB By anisotropic etching, pyramids structured silicon can be prepared using sodium hypochlorite for monocrystalline solar cells. Their influence on the reflectance of the silicon surface was studied to optimize the etching and reduce the optical losses of silicon surface more effectively. However, currently the reflectance of the pyramids structured silicon surface can only be reduced to above 10% in the visible range, which is still too high for high efficiency solar cells. Porous pyramids structured silicon is a promising antireflection coating to solve the problem of high surface reflectance in silicon solar cells. In this paper, a promising method for fabricating porous pyramids compound structure on silicon surface was proposed. The silicon surface was first texturized in NaOCl/C2H5OH and then electrochemically etched in HF/C2H5OH solution. The average reflectance of the surface in the range of 500-900 nm was as low as 5%. The surfaces prepared under optimized condition were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Spectrophotometry.

AB A soft deposition method for incorporating surface plasmon resonant metal nanoparticles within photovoltaic devices was studied. This self-assembly method provides excellent control over both nanoparticle size and surface coverage. Films of spherical Ag nanoparticles with diameter of similar to 100 nm were fabricated by depositing size-selected aerosols on various substrates using electrophoresis. This novel deposition method opens the route to embed plasmonic nanoparticles in the intermediate reflector of a micromorph silicon tandem PV cell. We have for the first time fabricated working tandem cells of this type. Compared to a flat reference device the Ag particles enhanced the short-circuit current density due to improved light trapping. The enhancement is, however, limited by the sulfidation on the surface of Ag nanoparticles and a further optimization of the cell fabrication method is required to prevent a reduction of open-circuit voltage and fill factor.

ID SILICON NANOWIRES; RECOMBINATION
AB Nanowire-based solar cells are interesting structures for photovoltaic applications as they enhance properties such as light absorption, trapping efficiency and carrier collection. Consequently, the potential to decrease the cost of photovoltaic energy thanks to these structures is not negligible. However, up to now, their efficiency has been limited mainly because of the recombination at the interfaces and in the volume. The effective minority carrier lifetime is a key parameter which is strongly connected to volume, interface and surface recombination properties. In this work, we have used a purely electrical approach called reverse recovery transient (RRT) to perform measurements of minority carrier lifetime in core-shell nanowire-based solar cells under dark conditions. The structures are based on crystalline silicon nanowires grown on silicon wafers and embedded in a radial amorphous silicon shell. The electrical contacts for this hetero-junction structure are transparent conductive oxide for the front surface and aluminum for the backside. A planar solar cell has also been fabricated to be used as a reference. By comparing RRT measurement on the nanowire-based solar cell and on the planar reference solar cell with simulations, we extract the lifetime of the nanowires. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The nanorods were fabricated on p-type (111)-oriented silicon substrates and, all substrates were seeded with a TiO2 seed layer synthesized by radio-frequency reactive magnetron sputtering system. Chemical bath deposition (CBD) was carried out to grow rutile TiO2 nanorods on Si substrate at different annealing temperatures (350, 550, 750, and 950 degrees C). Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analyses showed the tetragonal rutile structure of the synthesized TiO2 nanorods. Optical properties were examined by photoluminescence spectroscopy. The spectra exhibit one strong UV emission peak which can be seen at around 390 nm for all of the samples. In the visible region, TiO2 demonstrated two dominant PL emissions centered at around 519 and 705 nm. The experimental results showed that the TiO2 nanorods annealed at 550 degrees C exhibited the optimal structural properties. Moreover, the CBD method enabled the formation of photosensitive, high-quality rutile TiO2 nanorods with few defects for future optoelectronic nanodevice applications.

AB We report the synthesis of PbF2:Er3+ particles using a hydrothermal method. The structure and upconversion emission properties of the products are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometer, Raman spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrometry. An increase in Er3+ concentration in the crystals changes the PbF2 structure from a mixed phase to a cubic phase and decreases the grain size to nanoscale levels. Enhanced upconversion efficiency is achieved after annealing resulted from the formation of the cubic phase and the increase of grain size. The optimal Er3+ concentration is found to be 4% after annealing, and applied to the back of a bifacial silicon solar cell, maximum external quantum efficiencies of 0.38% and 0.79% are respectively obtained under 0.77 W/cm(2) laser excitation (1560 nm) and AM1.5 + laser co-excitation.

AB The intensified research into n-type silicon solar cells over the last few years let the application of boron doped emitters in suitable cell concepts become the preferred method to form the necessary p-n-junction. In this study an alternative process to fabricate a boron doped emitter via diffusion from a PECV-deposited doping source is presented and optimized for n-type crystalline silicon solar cell concepts. Doping profiles with a high surface concentration in combination with low emitter saturation current density values are achieved for improved contact and passivation characteristics. The boron emitter profile is compatible with various contacting techniques i.e. screen printing and vapour deposited Al, allowing for low-resistant contacting with Ag/Al pastes or sputtered Al. The comparably low emitter saturation current density j(0E) of 44 fA/cm(2) allows for a V-OC of 666 mV, and thereby a cell efficiency of 19.7% is demonstrated on a large area (156.25 cm(2)) solar cell.

AB Kerfless wafering techniques offer a significant cost saving potential via the reduction of silicon consumption. In this paper, we examine thin single crystalline Si foils that were fabricated by a novel kerfless thermo-mechanical exfoliation method utilizing evaporated Al with regard to their suitability for solar cell applications. The foils are 50-80 mu m thick and smooth to visual inspection across the almost entire surface. We measure the effective minority carrier lifetimes of the foils and the remaining parent substrates by quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) and spatially resolved by dynamically calibrated steady state infrared carrier lifetime mapping (dynILM). We find lifetimes of above 120 mu s for kerfless exfoliated 0.5 Omega cm p-type float-zone (FZ) Si layers. With an additional etching step after exfoliation, we obtain effective lifetimes of above 200 mu s. The measurements reveal that there is no critical lifetime degradation due to exfoliation-induced surface features and thus the exfoliated layers are well-suited for high-quality solar cells.

AB We present a 3-step metal-assisted chemical etching (MAE) texturing technique to fabricate nanoporous Si (MAE nSi) using mono-and multi-crystalline silicon (mc-si) substrate. We show that only a very short etch back is necessary to obtain low reflectance. The angular distribution of the reflected light suggests that most of the losses due to the surface reflectance can be recovered after encapsulation and this has been validated in this work. We demonstrate that by using the texturing method shown in this work, very low reflectance can be achieved upon encapsulation. The substantial reduction in reflectance, for some of the textures, upon encapsulation may be partly attributed to the angular distribution of light reflected from the textured surface. Texturing is shown to result in a modest increase in the surface area. However, the increase in the surface recombination rate is smaller than the increase in the surface area, and typically significantly less than a factor of 3, when samples are passivated with atomic layer deposited Al2O3. This result suggests neither the local curvature nor the predominant crystallographic orientation causes additional recombination at the MAE nSi surface. The combination of low surface reflectance and low surface recombination of the MAE nSi makes it a very interesting candidate for solar cell applications. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB To push silicon solar cells up to their theoretical limit and, in the meantime, minimize the amount of active material employed, many researchers have proposed to fabricate silicon solar cells starting from substrates of 100 mu m or below. A considerable number of methods have been proposed to overcome the limitations of the standard sawing technique but, all of them present some drawbacks. One of these methods, the Slim-cut method, exploits the stress-induced by the deposition of a layer on top of a thick silicon substrate to separate a thin silicon foil. This process however did not solve the issues linked to the processing of freestanding foils.
   In this work we present a flow to process the Slim-cut foils into solar cells by minimizing the number of process steps performed on free-standing foils to just one step. The possibility to tune the thickness of the obtained silicon foil is investigated both by analytical calculations and experimental results. Moreover, a solution to remove the stress-inducing layer compatible with the flow is reported and lifetime measurements of samples bonded on glass demonstrate that the quality of the samples is high enough for the fabrication of solar cells.

AB To realize high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells it is crucial to develop light-trapping methods that can increase absorption of the near-bandgap light in the silicon material. That can be achieved using the far-field scattering properties of metal nanoparticles (MNP) sustaining surface plasmons. The MNT's should be inserted in the back of the cell, embedded in the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer which separates the rear mirror from the silicon layers. In this way, a plasmonic back reflector (PER) is constructed that can redirect light at angles away from the incidence direction and thereby increase its path length in the cell material.
   In this work, a novel technique is presented to fabricate PERs (composed of Ag min-or/TCO/MNPsiTCO) containing colloidal gold MNTS patterned with a self-assembly wet-coating method. The method allows the construction of long-range ordered arrays of MNPs with monodispeise size and shape using fast, scalable, low-cost and low-temperature (<120 degrees C) procedures.
   Colloidal IMNPs are synthesized with spherical shapes, so their scattering properties are analytically modeled with Mie theory. Such formalism allowed the computation of the preferential MNP sizes that provide the best scattering performance for light-trapping in amorphous and microcrystalline thin-film silicon solar cells.

AB Gadolinium and indium co-doped CdO thin films were prepared by a pulsed laser deposition method. The XRD and XPS results indicated that Gd3+ and In3+ ions occupied locations in the interstitial positions and/or Cd2+-ion vacancies in the CdO lattice. The FESEM images showed that the films were homogeneous and consisted of nanograins with a size range of 23-40 nm. The optical band gap of the CdO thin films can be engineered over a wide range of 2.72-3.56 eV by introducing Gd and In dopants. Such transparent semiconducting Gd and In co-doped CdO films were then grown on p-type Si substrates to fabricate n-CdO/p-Si heterojunction devices. The important junction parameters such as the series resistance (R-s), ideality factor (n) and Schottky barrier height (Phi(b)) were determined by analysing different plots from the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics. The obtained results indicated that the electrical properties of the heterojunction diodes were controlled by the dopant concentration. The p-Si/n-Cd1-x-yGdxInyO heterojunction diode showed the best values of open circuit voltage, V-oc = 1.04 V and short circuit current density, J(sc) = 11.4 mA cm(-2) under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm(-2), which was suitable for solar cell applications.

AB Hierarchically arranged nanostructures, configured in both nanopillars and nanoholes, have been fabricated via a low-cost approach that combines metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE), nanosphere lithography and conventional photolithography. By manipulating the catalyst morphology as well as the deposition method, different interesting nanostructures like nanowalls and nanograsses were fabricated at the galleries among the nanopillar blocks. Using a similar strategy, hierarchical negative structures (nanoholes) have also been successfully demonstrated. The successful construction of these diversified hierarchical nanostructures illustrates that MaCE could be employed as a feasible, low-cost method for multi-scale silicon micro/nano machining, which is highly desirable for widespread applications, including tissue engineering, optoelectronics, photonic devices and lab-on-chip systems.

AB TiO2-organic thin films were fabricated on SAMs-coated silicon substrate based on layer-by-layer self-assembly process and chemical bath deposition method by a hydrolysis of TiCl4 in acid aqueous solution. The influences of deposition time and solution pH value on structural properties and the thickness of TiO2 films were investigated. The results of UV-vis spectrum show the absorbance of aqueous solutions at 410 nm decreases gradually with increasing deposition time and solution pH value. The thickness of TiO2-organic thin film elevates as increasing deposition time and pH value. The deposition time has significant influence on the surface morphology of films, and when the time is 2 h, a continuous, density and homogeneous film is gained from SEM micrographs. The deposited films consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles are believed to be fully amorphous layers from the results of XRD. The major chemical compositions of thin films are titanium and oxygen as presented in EDS results, and O/Ti atomic ratio is close to the corresponding ratio of 2:1 for stoichiometric TiO2. The transmission infrared spectrum and UV/Vis spectrum of TiO2 film indicate excellent structure and optical properties of films.

AB We propose a novel nanostructure semiconductor which integrated the nanowire (NW) template and the zero dimensional quantum dot (QD) active region. We successfully fabricated InGaN quantum dots on the nonpolar facet of n-GaN NWs via a new self-catalyst method using In droplets. The resultant InGaN QDs were of a quadrangle shape. Their average width and height were 30 and 7 nm, respectively. HR-TEM analysis verified that the InGaN QDs were epitaxially grown on the m-plane facet of n-GaN NWs and had high crystalline quality without any defects. The low-temperature PL spectra of InGaN QDs indicated a prominent emission in the range of 387-425 nm which consisted of several overlapping sharp peaks owing to the different sizes of InGaN QDs. As a result, we expect that this unique InGaN QD growth method can be widely applied to other nanostructure semiconductor systems and that this newly integrated nanostructure semiconductor will be a very promising material for high-quality optoelectronic device applications.

TI Back-reflector design in thin-film silicon solar cells by rigorous 3D

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find an optimized thin-film amorphous silicon solar cell design by numerically optimizing the light trapping efficiency of a pyramid-structured back-reflector using a frequency-domain finite element Maxwell solver. For this purpose short circuit current densities and absorption spectra within the investigated solar cell model are systematically analyzed. Furthermore, the authors employ a topology simulation method to accurately predict the material layer interfaces within the investigated solar cell model. The method simulates the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that is typically used to fabricate thin-film solar cells by combining a ballistic transport and reaction model (BTRM) with a level-set method in an iterative approach. Predicted solar cell models are far more realistic compared to solar cell models created assuming conformal material growth. The purpose of the topology simulation method is to increase the accuracy of thin-film solar cell models in order to facilitate highly accurate simulation results in solar cell design optimizations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors perform numeric optimizations using a frequency domain finite element Maxwell solver. Topology simulations are carried out using a BTRM combined with a level-set method in an iterative fashion.
   Findings - The simulation results reveal that the employed pyramid structured back-reflectors effectively increase the light path in the absorber mainly by exciting photonic waveguide modes. In using the optimization approach, the authors have identified solar cell models with cell periodicities around 480 nm and pyramid base widths around 450 nm to yield the highest short circuit current densities. Compared to equivalent solar cell models with flat back-reflectors, computed short circuit current densities are significantly increased. Furthermore, the paper finds that the solar cell models computed using the topology simulation approach represent a far more realistic approximation to a real solar cell stack compared to solar cell models computed by a conformal material growth assumption.
   Research limitations/implications - So far in the topology simulation approach the authors assume CVD as the material deposition process for all material layers. However, during the fabrication process sputtering (i.e. physical vapor deposition) will be employed for the Al:ZnO and ITO layers. In the framework of this ongoing research project the authors will extend the topology simulation approach to take the different material deposition processes into account. The differences in predicted material interfaces will presumably be only minor compared to the results shown here and certainly be insignificant relative to the differences the authors observe for solar cell models computed assuming conformal material growth.
   Originality/value - The authors systematically investigate and optimize the light trapping efficiency of a pyramid nano-structured back-reflector using rigorous electromagnetic field computations with a 3D finite element Maxwell solver. To the authors' knowledge such an investigation has not been carried out yet in the solar cell research literature. The topology simulation approach (to the best of the authors' knowledge) has previously not been applied to the modelling of solar cells. Typically a conformal layer growth assumption is used instead.

AB We present a unique process for fabricating silicon nanorods wrapped with a graphitic material on a silicon substrate by the chemical vapor deposition method with no metal catalyst, as well as characterization of their intrinsic properties. First, well-ordered silicon nanorod axes were grown via an electroless metal deposition method, followed by chemical vapor deposition to wrap the axes with a carbon nanotube. Interestingly, the use of ethanol treatment before chemical vapor deposition prevents the formation of SiOx layers, which may be necessary as seed layers for carbon nanotube growth. Since this method for carbon nanotube growth does not involve a metal catalyst, the intrinsic properties of the Si NRs were well characterized. A few characterization methods (XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and EELS) were carried out to prove that the Si NRs were completely surrounded by CNTs. In addition, the conductance results (by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy) show that the charge carrier transport characteristics of the multiwall carbon nanotubes are found mainly in the outermost shell, and that the Si NR surface was well passivated by the multiwall carbon nanotube structure. This coaxial structure, which does not require a metal catalyst, represents a significant step forward for realizing applications for carbon nanotube devices.

AB A simple, fast, and cost-effective method was developed in this paper for the high-throughput fabrication of nanohole arrays on silicon (Si), which is utilized for antireflection. Wafer-scale polystyrene (PS) monolayer colloidal crystal was developed as templates by spin-coating method. Metallic shadow mask was prepared by lifting off the oxygen etched PS beads from the deposited chromium film. Nanohole arrays were fabricated by Si dry etching. A series of nanohole arrays were fabricated with the similar diameter but with different depth. It is found that the maximum depth of the Si-hole was determined by the diameter of the Cr-mask. The antireflection ability of these Si-hole arrays was investigated. The results show that the reflection decreases with the depth of the Si-hole. The deepest Si-hole arrays show the best antireflection ability (reflection < 9%) at long wavelengths (>600 nm), which was about 28 percent of the nonpatterned silicon wafer's reflection. The proposed method has the potential for high-throughput fabrication of patterned Si wafer, and the low reflectivity allows the application of these wafers in crystalline silicon solar cells.

AB Most of the photovoltaic industry uses wafer of single-crystal and poly-crystal silicon as a material of their photovoltaic (PV) modules. However, the cost of these modules is high due to the material and processing cost. Cuprous oxides (Cu2O)have several features that suitable for future photovoltaic applications. Cu2O can be prepared with simple methods at very low cost. Cu2O p-n homojunction solar cell is a device that converts sunlight to electrical energy, consists of two similar materials for its p-n junction, which is Cu2O. The p-type and n-type of Cu2O thin films are then fabricated to produce solar cells. Other layers aluminium and glass substrate coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) need to be added as a contact for electrons movement. In this study, p-type Cu2O, n-type Cu2O and p-n junction are prepared in order to become accustomed for solar cell applications. To achieve the optimum deposition conditions, p-n junction solar cell is prepared by two-steps electrochemical deposition process. The result from x-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that the peak is dominated by CuO (1, 1, 1). P-n junction is in between the p-type and n-type of Cu2O layer. Al has the thickness of 427.5nm. The second and the third layer are p and n type of Cu2O, which have the thickness of 106.9nm and 92.3nm, respectively. Finally the thickness of ITO layer is 131.1nm.An absorption experiment at AM1 light is performed in order to get the I-V curves, and in fact, to study the electrical solar cells p-n homojunction. Based on I-V curve test, the level of energy conversion of cell is 0.00141% with fill factor, FF 0.94813 which proved that Cu2O p-n homojunction solar cell can be fabricated and produced at very low cost and well function.

AB The optical absorption coefficient is a crucial parameter in determining solar cell efficiency under operational conditions. It is well known that inorganic nanocrystals are a benchmark model for solar cell nanotechnology, given that the tunability of optical properties and stabilization of specific phases are uniquely possible at the nanoscale. A hydrothermal method was employed to fabricate nanostructured copper oxides where the shape, size and phase were tailored by altering the growth parameters, namely the base media used, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time. The nano crystalline structures, phases, morphology, molecular vibrational modes, and optical properties were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and UV-vis spectroscopy. A significantly large optical absorption coefficient, of the order of twice that of Si in the visible range, was observed in a particular phase mixture of nanostructured copper oxides. An optical absorption coefficient of 7.05 10(+5) cm(-1) at 525 nm was observed in a particular nanostructured phase mixture of copper oxides which is appreciably larger than commercially pure CuO (1.19 10(+5) cm(-1)) and Si (1.72 10(+5) cm(-1)). A possible mechanism of formation of phase mixtures and morphology of copper oxides has also been discussed, which opens up a roadmap in synthesis of similar morphology nanostructures for efficient solar cells.

AB The object of this paper is to develop a high antireflection silicon solar cell. A novel two-stage metal-assisted etching (MAE) method is proposed for the fabrication of an antireflective layer of a micronanohybrid structure array. The processing time for the etching on an N-type high-resistance (NH) silicon wafer can be controlled to around 5 min. The resulting micronanohybrid structure array can achieve an average reflectivity of 1.21% for a light spectrum of 200-1000 nm. A P-N junction on the fabricated micronanohybrid structure array is formed using a low-cost liquid diffusion source. A high antireflection silicon solar cell with an average efficiency of 13.1% can be achieved. Compared with a conventional pyramid structure solar cell, the shorted circuit current of the proposed solar cell is increased by 73%. The major advantage of the two-stage MAE process is that a high antireflective silicon substrate can be fabricated cost-effectively in a relatively short time. The proposed method is feasible for the mass production of low-cost solar cells.

AB A novel type of plasmonic light trapping structure is presented in this paper, composed of metal nanoparticles synthesized in colloidal solution and self-assembled in uniform long-range arrays using a wet-coating method. The high monodispersion in size and spherical shape of the gold colloids used in this work allows a precise match between their measured optical properties and electromagnetic simulations performed with Mie theory, and enables the full exploitation of their collective resonant plasmonic behavior for light-scattering applications. The colloidal arrays are integrated in plasmonic back reflector (PBR) structures aimed for light trapping in thin film solar cells. The PBRs exhibit high diffuse reflectance (up to 75%) in the red and near-infrared spectrum, which can pronouncedly enhance the near-bandgap photocurrent generated by the cells. Furthermore, the colloidal PBRs are fabricated by low-temperature (< 120 degrees C) processes that allow their implementation, as a final step of the cell construction, in typical commercial thin film devices generally fabricated in a superstrate configuration.

AB In recent years, there has been growing consideration of renewable energy especially photovoltaic devices. A silicon (Si) based solar cell is the most popularly and frequently considered among the photovoltaic devices, but its bulk thickness issue lowers the performance and hinders widespread application due to the material cost. Also, this thick nature causes difference in length between minority carrier diffusion and sufficient light absorption. To mitigate the issues there have been many recent studies on Si photovoltaic devices adopting nanostructuring strategies to enhance the performance. Therefore, we report two different approaches on recent nanostructuring techniques for photovoltaic devices; bottom-up and top-down processes, which are composed of vapor-liquid-solid, solution-liquid-solid, reactive ion etching with Langmuir Blodgett and metal assisted chemical etching. Those fabrication processes enable the fabrication of nanostructures with a highly ordered and alignment structures leading to enhance the light absorption and have an appropriate thickness of Si substrate regressing Auger recombination. The fabricated nanowire and nanocone array structures outperform existing results with light absorption exceeding 90%.

AB In this work, single-crystalline p-type Cd3P2 nanowires (NWs) were synthesized on a Cd sheet via a facile chemical vapor deposition method. Then field-effect transistors and high-performance photodetectors were fabricated based on these NWs. It was found that hole mobility of a pristine Cd3P2 NW is around 2.94 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Meanwhile, high responsivity and photoconductive gain were observed on these devices across a broad spectral range covering UV-visible to NIR with high stability and reproducibility. Furthermore, hybrid organic inorganic n-type phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and p-type Cd3P2 NW heterojunction photodetectors were also fabricated, exhibiting much improved photocurrent and photoconductive gain, as compared to the device made of pristine Cd3P2 NWs. Intriguingly, the flexible hybrid photodetectors have been fabricated on plastic substrates and characterized under various bending conditions, demonstrating their excellent flexibility and robustness. The high performance and flexibility of the hybrid photodetectors are promising for further applications requiring large-area, high-sensitivity, and high-speed photodetectors with broad-spectrum photoresponse.

AB The fabrication of well-separated, narrow, and relatively smooth silicon nanowires with good periodicity is demonstrated, using non-close-packed arrays of nanospheres with precisely controlled diameters, pitch, and roughness. Controlled reactive ion etching in an inductively coupled plasma reduces the self-assembled nanospheres to approximately a tenth of their original diameter, while retaining their surface smoothness and periodic placement. A titanium adhesion layer between the silicon substrate and gold film allows much thinner catalyst layers to be continuous, facilitating the film liftoff and formation of the perforated pattern without influencing catalyzed etching of silicon. Using these methods, a periodic array of silicon nanowires with a large pitch and small diameter (e.g., a 490 nm pitch and 55 nm diameter) is created, a combination not typically found in the open literature. This approach extends the types and quality of silicon nanostructures that can be fabricated using the combined nanosphere lithography and metal-assisted chemical etching techniques.

AB We present a facile method to fabricate one-dimensional Si nanostructures based on Ag-induced selective etching of silicon wafers. To obtain evenly distributed Si nanowires (SiNWs), the fabrication parameters have been optimized. As a result, a maximum of average growth rate of 0.15 mu m/min could be reached. Then, the fabricated samples were characterized by water contact angle (CA) experiments. As expected, the as-etched silicon samples exhibited a contact angle in the range of 132A degrees-136.5A degrees, whereas a higher contact angle (145A degrees) could be obtained by chemical modification of the SiNWs with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). Additionally, Raman spectra experiments have been carried out on as-prepared nanostructures, showing a typical decreasing from 520.9 cm(-1) to 512.4 cm(-1) and an asymmetric broadening, which might be associated with the phonon quantum confinement effect of Si nanostructures.

AB In this work, a simple method of solution process to fabricate high density Silicon nanohole (SiNH) arrays on n-type wafer is experimented. SiNHs exhibit very low reflectance from range of wavelength 300 to 1100 nm irrespective of the angle of incidence, better than Si nanowires. The SiNH arrays have a strong light trapping effect between the nanostructures causes high absorption. We experimentally demonstrate high-efficiency organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells, Si/PEDOT:PSS with silicon nanoholes. Such SilPEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells exhibit high Jsc of 36.80 mA/cm(2), Voc of 0.52V, FF of 66.50%, and thus power conversion efficiency (peE) of 12.72%. SiNH arrays produce a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, hence allowing efficient light harvesting and charge collection via the formation of a core-sheath p-n junction.

AB This paper reports a patterning and metallization method for silicon solar cells fabrications. Patterning was achieved by the inkjet printing of a dye-based ink as a mask to protect the photoresist from UV-light initiated crosslinking. The patterned photoresist was used to facilitate the etching of a pattern in the underlying dielectric layer and also to act as a metal plating mask. This method resulted in fine point openings in the photoresist layer with a diameter of 15 Jim and line openings with a width of 30 Jim. Nickel/copper plated homogeneous emitter silicon solar cells with an efficiency of 18.2% on small size Cz wafers were fabricated using this method, may find applications in the metallization of future heterojunction, rear contact and PERC cells.

AB In the metallization technology for crystalline Si solar cell, it has been required to develop new material with low cost for high-temperature and highly-reliable interconnection. We have developed new method to fabricate fine metal alloy particles with narrow distribution of particle size from 0.5 to 10 mu m. We called it as Nanomized method. The fine particles are composed of uniform structure dispersed metal alloy in nanoscale level and do not include void in the particle. The metal alloy particles fabricated by conventional atomized method include void inside particle and non-uniformly dispersed alloy components. We confirmed reliability and mechanical strength. We produced bonding material from the mixture of Cu particles and Sn-based alloy particles. The bonding strength of die chip on Al electrode reached 80 MPa as a top data, 50 MPa in average. The bonding strength of Sn-based alloy particle fabricated from conventional atomized method deteriorated less than 8 MPa after 500 hours later at 300 degree C.

AB The present work demonstrates the fabrication of a-Si:H based thin film solar cells on Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) flexible substrate using Hot-Wire CVD technique. The intrinsic a-Si:H thin films deposited at process temperature (T-S) below 130 degrees C with certain hydrogen dilution show a five order photoconductivity gain. The electronic Density of states (DOS) of these films have been investigated by Constant Photocurrent Method (CPM) which reveals a good correlation between H-2 dilution of the silane gas during deposition, film microstructure and the electronic properties. Subsequently, p-i-n type solar cells were fabricated on PEN and glass substrates under similar deposition conditions of low TS and 40-50% H-2 dilution. The solar cell deposited on PEN shows an efficiency of 5.7% while the simultaneously deposited cell on glass substrate shows an efficiency of 6%.

AB In this paper, an one-step method to fabricate the black silicon with varying scale was introduced. This novel method was conducted at room temperature and completely compatible with the traditional process. This method was based on a standard Bosch deep reactive ions etching with a phase-delay producer. The relationship between the process parameter and the key physical factor was investigated and the practical reflectance of the black silicon was measured. The results showed the black silicon, produced by this method, had a very low reflectance and was easy to change the scale

AB Double cone nanostructures are proposed for the ultimate anti-reflectivity of encapsulated silicon solar cells. The proposed design consists of high aspect ratio silicon nanocones covered by a polymeric layer textured with inverted nanocone structures. Both nanocones and inverted nanocones effectively suppress Fresnel reflection at each interface by means of gradient index effect, while the inverted nanocones on the top surface provide enhanced mechanical robustness. Also, the proposed design is fabricated using methods compatible with large-scale replication, which have potential to be applied to the energy industry.

AB We present a low-cost method to fabricate large-area polycarbonate AR nanostructures to improve the luminous intensity and image clarity of a commercial 2.0-inch display panel in bright condition. The polycarbonate AR nanostructures were nanoimprinted by the graded-density nanoporous silicon template with nanoparticle-catalyzed etching. The average reflectivity of the AR film in visible wavelength region was reduced from 10.2% to 4.8% in the optimized case. After attaching on the display panel to reduce the light reflection on the substrate, the brightness enhancement and decrease of ambient light reflection were observed. Due to the enhancement of contrast ratio, the quality index of the Lena image test was improved from 0.85 to 0.92 under strong ambient illumination. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America

AB The authors have successfully developed "W-textured" ZnO:B-coated soda-lime glass substrates with higher haze value and lower reflectance and thus, improved light-trapping effect, especially, in the long wavelength region. In order to obtain higher efficiency the authors have applied here this technique to a white glass substrate which has higher transmittance. The authors have investigated the relationship between its refractive index on each side of the glass before RIE etching and the RMS roughness of ZnO:B layer coated by the MOCVD method (on either side of the glass) after etching. For the surface morphology of the ZnO:B layer deposited on the side of the RIE-etched white glass with lower refractive index, it was found, in this study, that it shows mountain-chain-like double texture with higher haze value. Whereas ZnO:B layers deposited on soda-lime glass (SLG) investigated in a previous study, have cauliflower-like morphology and lower haze values. By using the newly developed white glass substrates, a higher short-circuit current density J(sc) could be obtained corresponding to an improved spectral response, especially in the long wavelength regions ( > 500 nm). As a result, the a-Si:H/mu c-Si:H solar cell fabricated on this newly developed substrate has an initial efficiency of 13.2% which is higher than the one for substrates based on soda-lime glass. This shows that this newly developed W-textured substrate is a promising solution for the deposition of high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
