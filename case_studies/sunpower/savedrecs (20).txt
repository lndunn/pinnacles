AB In this work, we report on the results of using a Diamond-Like Carbon / Porous Silicon (DLC/PS) double layer as antireflection coating to enhance the performance of multicrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells. DLC layers were obtained by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) method. The properties of these layers were investigated in order to establish the optimum preparation conditions for solar cell applications. Then, thin films of combined porous silicon-DLC structure were fabricated for antireflection coating use. The spectral response of a solar cell based on multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) coated with a PS layer, formed by electrochemical process was enhanced compared to a cell without porous silicon layer as emitter. Further improvements are obtained by a deposition of a thin DLC film. The results of the solar cell parameters before and after porous silicon formation and DLC coating are discussed.

AB Hexagonally patterned SiO2 nanohole arrays having sub-10 nm of width were directly formed via carbothermal reduction of SiO2 with carbon-dissolved iron nanoparticles (NPs) (C(on iron NPs, s) + SiO2(s) <-> SiO(g) + CO(g)). Iron NPs prepared by hydroxylamine-mediated synthesis method resulted in not only nanoholes but also nanotrenches because the diameter of these iron NPs is suitable for the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) that further react with underneath SiO2 to produce nanotrenches. Higher yields of nanoholes were obtained by using larger-sized iron NPs (diameter: 3-8 nm) prepared from ferritins and by reducing the amount of active carbon precursor sources during the reaction, by which the growth of SWNTs were substantially suppressed. SiO2 nanohole arrays were then obtained from hexagonally self-arrayed iron NPs, which were fabricated using polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) micelles. In addition to the reactivity of carbothermal reduction, interparticular distance of the patterned iron NPs turned out to be a key factor to successfully form nanohole arrays. The interparticular distance was controlled by changing the composition of PS-b-P2VP micelles.

AB A new catalyst seeding method is presented, in which aerosolized catalyst nanoparticles are continuously self-assembled onto amine-terminated silicon substrates in gas phase to realize controllable synthesis of vertically aligned Mg-doped GaN nanorod arrays on n-type Si (111) substrates. The diameter, areal density, and length of GaN nanorods can be controlled by adjusting the size of Au nanoparticles, flowing time of Au nanoparticles, and growth time, respectively. Based on the synthesis of p-type GaN nanorods on n-type Si substrates, p-GaN nanorod/n-Si heterojunction diodes are fabricated, which exhibit well-defined rectifying behavior with a low turn-on voltage of similar to 1.0 V and a low leakage current even at a reverse bias up to 10 V. The controllable growth of GaN nanorod arrays and the realization of p-type GaN nanorod/n-type Si heterojunction diodes open up opportunities for low-cost and high-performance optoelectronic devices based on these nanostructured arrays.

Taguchi methods are employed to optimize the diameter control and to understand the influence of all processing factors on the growth. The < 100 > directions are found to be the preferred crystallographic orientation of the growing SiNWs (see figure).

TI Chirped porous silicon reflectors for thin-film epitaxial silicon solar

ID MIRRORS
AB The studies of porous silicon as a one-dimensional photonic crystal have led to solutions allowing the fabrication of broad photonic band gaps as large as several hundreds nanometers for various types of applications. In this work we demonstrate the use of the chirping process, i.e., the gradual increase in the spatial period of the structure, as it is used in image processing, to design porous silicon broad-band reflectors for thin-film silicon solar cells. Modeling of those layers is done using linear design method and a simulation software. Such chirped structures are fabricated by an anodization process. Samples are prepared on mono and multicrystalline silicon substrates with 15, 40, 60, and 80 layers. The reflectance spectra of such prepared porous reflectors are evaluated and the results show an increase in bandwidth of over 50% of the total width in comparison with the conventional, unchirped reflectors. We demonstrate clear advantages of introducing chirped multilayer structures over conventional ones. Although some understanding of chirping exists mainly in the field of image processing and photonics, detailed study of chirped porous structures as broad-band reflectors is needed for their implementation in thin-film epitaxial silicon solar cells. A record efficiency of almost 14% was reached for those types of reflectors on a large area 71 cm(2) epitaxial Si solar cell, giving a boost in efficiency of 0.6% absolute in comparison with the solar cells containing conventional reflectors.

AB Epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) is a suitable method which makes it possible to obtain thin layers for applications in the thin film solar cells technology. Due to the method it is possible to save the material which is used in production to make PV modules more economical. Moreover, an ELO layer is partly separated from the growth substrate by an SiO2 cover which prevents propagation of defects into the ELO layer from the substrate. It means that even poor quality silicon substrates can be used to fabricate good quality solar cells. Growing a continuous thin silicon layer on a specially prepared growth silicon substrate is the first step to obtain photovoltaic (PV) modules. The morphology as well as the layer quality and the density of defects depend on various factors: growth temperature, cooling Fate, growth time, atmosphere, substrate type, etc. This work presents an analysis of silicon ELO layers growth in different conditions using a horizontal LPE setup. The results can be used to determine the best conditions of growth in order to obtain optimal Si layers for PV applications. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface texturing of silicon can reduce the reflectance of-incident light and hence increase the conversion efficiency of solar cells. Comparatively lesser concentrated (10%) standard alkaline (NaOH/KOH) solution does not give good textured multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) surface, which could give satisfactory open-circuit voltage. This is due to grain-boundary delineation with steps formed between successive grains of different orientations. In this work an attempt has been made to obtain a well-textured mc-Si surface through three different approaches. The first two are with two different types of acid solutions and the third with concentrated alkaline NaOH. Solutions of HF-HNO3-CH3-COOH/H2O system with different concentrations of HF and HNO3 were used for texturing. The results on the effect of texturing of these three solutions on the surface morphology of very large area (125 mm x 125 mm) mc-Si wafer as well as on the performance parameters of solar cell are presented in this paper. Attempts have been made to study extensively the surface morphologies of mc-Si wafers in two effective regions of the isoetch curves of the HF:HNO3:diluent's system. Also we studied the reflectance, uniformity, spectral response, short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor and dark current-voltage of the cells fabricated using wafers textured with the three different methods. Short-circuit current of the solar cells fabricated using acid-textured wafers were measured to be in the range of 4.93 A. This value is 0.37 and 0.14 A higher than the short-circuit current values measured in the cells fabricated with isotextured and alkaline-textured wafers, respectively. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Large-area slantingly-aligned silicon nanowire arrays (SA-SiNW arrays) on Si( 111) substrate have been fabricated by wet chemical etching with dry metal deposition method and employed in the fabrication of solar cells for the first time. The formation of SA-SiNW arrays possibly results from the anisotropic etching of silicon by silver catalysts. Superior to the previous cells fabricated with vertically-aligned silicon nanowire arrays (VA-SiNW arrays), the SA-SiNW array solar cells exhibit a highest power conversion efficiency of 11.37%. The improved device performance is attributed to the integration of the excellent anti-reflection property of the arrays and the better electrical contact of the cell as a result of the special slantingly-aligned structure. The high surface recombination velocity of minority carriers in SiNW arrays is still the main limitation on cell performance.

AB We present a method to measure transient photovoltage at nanointerfaces using ultrafast electron diffraction. In particular, we report our results on the photoexcitation of carriers and their ensuing relaxations in a hydroxyl-terminated silicon surface, which is a standard substrate for fabricating molecular electronics interfaces. The transient surface voltage is determined by observing Coulomb refraction changes induced by the modified space-charge barrier within a selectively probed volume by femtosecond electron pulses. The results are in agreement with ultrafast photoemission studies of surface-state charging, suggesting a surface charge relaxation mechanism closely coupled to the bulk carrier dynamics near the surface that can be described by a drift-diffusion model. This study demonstrates an ultrafast diffraction method for investigating interfacial processes with both charge and structural resolutions.

AB A ITO/(p)Si heterojunction was fabricated by depositing Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) thin films onto well cleaned p-type silicon wafer by thermal evaporation method from pure ITO powder at substrate temperature 523K. The different diode parameters were calculated from the current-voltage characteristics of the junctions. The diode ideality factor was found to be greater than 1 and the diode had high series resistance. The I-V characteristics under illumination showed poor photovoltaic effect of the junction. Large series resistance, high defect density and presence of interfacial layer are thought to be the main causes for higher value diode ideality factor and poor photovoltaic conversion efficiency.

ID DLC FILMS; DEPOSITION
AB Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were deposited on coming glass and silicon substrates by the RF-PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) method using methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H-2) gases. We examined the effects of the CH4 to H-2 ratio on the tribological and optical properties of the DLC films. The hardness of the DLC films was measured with a nano-indenter. The optical properties of the DLC thin film were investigated by UV/VIS spectrometry and ellipsometry. From these measurements, we obtained optimum anti-reflection coating at a methane flow rate of 20 sccm. Also, solar cells were fabricated on a silicon substrate using the optimized DLC films as an anti-reflection coating and we obtained an increase of solar cell efficiency of about 20%.

AB We report a bioinspired templating technique for fabricating broadband antireflection coatings that mimic antireflective moth eyes. Wafer-scale, subwavelength-structured nipple arrays are directly patterned on silicon using spin-coated silica colloidal monolayers as etching masks. The templated gratings exhibit excellent broadband antireflection properties and the normal-incidence specular reflection matches with the theoretical prediction using a rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) model. We further demonstrate that two common simulation methods, RCWA and thin-film multilayer models, generate almost identical prediction for the templated nipple arrays. This simple bottom-up technique is compatible with standard microfabrication, promising for reducing the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar cells. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.

AB We fabricates large grain low temperature polycrystalline silicon film by aluminum induced crystallization method which can be applied to thin film solar cell. The fabrication process contains two stages of a-Si deposition. The first annealed polycrystalline silicon film is used as the seeding layer in the crystallization of the next thicker amorphous silicon film. Aluminum etching is applied at the end of the second annealing process. The overall thickness of the silicon film is over 1 mu m. The annealing temperature is set at 500 degrees C and last for 1 hour in the first annealing stage. The crystallinity of the first annealed silicon film is discussed in this paper. In the second annealing stage, two different annealing temperature (450 and 500 degrees C) and five different annealing time (15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes) are chosen to see the effects of annealing temperature and time on the crystallization of poly silicon film. Leakage current and surface topography will also be studied. XRD and Raman spectra analysis are used to identify the crystallinity of specimens made under different annealing time and temperatures. The surface and cross-section observation are observed and discussed via scanning electron micrographs. The IN characteristic is tested to see the magnitude of leakage current of poly silicon film in our study.

AB Hybrid thin-film solar cells are fabricated on the glass substrate using ZnO nanorods, well-aligned single-crystalline Si nanowires (SiNWs), and poly 3-hexylthiphene):vertical bar 6,6 vertical bar-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as well as micro-structured III-V semiconductors. The effect of introducing a solution-processed fullerene as an electron transport layer on the polymer/ZnO nanorod array composite solar cells is investigated. Devices with the fullerene layer exhibit a larger short circuit current density (10.16 mA/cm(2)) than those without this layer (9.37 mA/cm(2)). For the Si NWs with P3HT:PCBM, the well-aligned SiNWs are fabricated from Si wafer and transferred onto the glass substrate with the P3HT:PCBM. Such SiNWs provide uninterrupted conduction paths for electron transport, enhancing the optical absorption to serve as an absorber, and increase the surface area for exciton dissociation. Our investigations show that Si NWs are promising for hybrid organic photovoltaic cells with improved performance by increasing the short-circuit current density from 7.17 to 11.61 mA/cm(2). III-V semiconductors are also used for thin-film solar cells. InGaP/GaAs two-junction square-based (25 mu m x 25 mu m) cuboid arrays with a height of 6.52 mu m were released from GaAs substrates by the epitaxial lift-off process, These InGaP/GaAs cuboid arrays were transplanted to the P3HT film spun on ITO glass substrate. In addition to the significant cost reduction, our method shows the rapid transplantation and the potential for high-efficiency large-area devices fabrication.

AB Solar cells and optical detection devices are often covered with antireflective surfaces to enhance their performance. An economical, fast, and easily operational electrochemical etching technique has been developed to realize a continuous uniform variation in the refractive index of porous silicon layer as a function of the etching depth. By using this technique a black silicon sample was fabricated, which has a reflectance below 5% over a broad band and a thickness below 1 mu m. The depression mechanism of the optical reflectance is analyzed by simulating the structure with the transfer matrix method. The simulated results give a good agreement with the experimental measurements.

AB In this paper, a discussion is made of the design of silicon cells to be used in a six-junction tandem solar cell structure as part of the Very High Efficiency Solar Cell (VHESC) program. Minority carrier recombination at surfaces and in the volume, internal quantum efficiency, resistance losses, free carrier parasitic absorption, optical reflection, light trapping, and light absorption must be traded off against each other. Modelling was used to analyse the various parameters and produce estimates of short circuit current, rill factor and open-circuit voltage of the cell. In addition, quasi-steady-state phtotoconductance measurements to analyse carrier recombination and emitter saturation current (Joe) as well as to predict the open-circuit voltage of solar cell is presented. For metallisation of such small solar cells, alternate methods of making contact such as light-induced plating and electrolyte plating in addition to evaporating metal on the contacts were explored and employed. Numerical resistive loss modelling was made to calculate the optimum metal thickness achieved by light-induced and electroplating to minimise resistive losses. Experiments were conducted to determine the proper plating rate by light-induced and electrolyte plating. Cells were fabricated by standard silicon processing techniques followed by testing of IV curves using current-voltage flash-tester to achieve the target efficiency.

AB Sliver solar cells are thin, mono-crystalline silicon solar cells, fabricated using micro-machining techniques combined with standard solar cell fabrication technology. Sliver solar modules can be efficient, low cost, bifacial, transparent, flexible, shadow-tolerant, and lightweight. Sliver modules require only 5 to 10% of the pure silicon and less than 5% of the wafer starts per MWp of factory output when compared with conventional photovoltaic modules. At ANU, we have produced 20% efficient Sliver solar cells using a robust, optimised cell fabrication process described in this paper. We have devised a rapid, reliable and simple method for extracting Sliver cells from a Sliver wafer, and methods for assembling modularised Sliver cell sub-modules. The method for forming these Sliver sub-modules, along with a low-cost method for rapidly forming reliable electrical interconnections, are presented. Using the sub-module approach, we describe low-cost methods for assembling and encapsulating Sliver cells into a range of module designs.

AB Detection of nuclear materials is critical in preventing traffic of illicit nuclear materials. Several methods that are based on detection of spontaneous or induced emission of fission neutron are considered. Efficient fast and thermal neutron detectors are generally required. For some applications these detectors must have fast response and should be deployed with large or small detection area.
   This work expands upon the basic concept of coating a p-n junction solar cell with a neutron detection layer that typically employs either (6)Li or (10)B. (10)B has a larger absorption cross section and results in higher detection efficiency. When an incident neutron interacts with (10)B, it releases an a-particle and a (7)Li ion; this a-particle excites electron-hole-pairs in the silicon p-n junction. This work investigated a variety of different silicon trench/pillar/hole geometries in combination with the (10)B filling or coating; thermal neutron detection efficiencies as high as 30% are projected. It utilizes trenches spaced as closely as 2 mu m and 50 pm deep. Simulations predict that when these single layer detectors are bonded in a multiple layer configuration, efficiencies in the range of 90% could be achieved.
   Along with nuclear and electrical simulations, a highly controllable deep-reactive-ion-etching (DRIE) recipe is developed for trench/pillar/hole etching. The ability to create p-n junctions along those trenches is presented. Trenches and pillars as small as 2 pm by 2 mu m are fabricated and p-n junctions are created along their surface. Smooth, uniform trenches are ready for trench refilling procedures.

AB Heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using single crystal silicon nanowires and the organic semiconductor regioregular poly-(3-hexyl thiophene) (RR-P3HT). N-type nanowires were first grown on an n+ silicon substrate by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method. Devices were then fabricated by filling the gap between the nanowires and a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode with a polymer. For initial devices the gap was filled with P3HT deposited from chlorobenzene solution. Device performance indicates that both silicon and P3HT act as absorbers for photovoltaic response, but that photocurrents were very low due to high series resistance in the cell. A second type of device was fabricated by depositing a thin layer of P3HT on the grown nanowires by dip coating from a dilute solution, and then filling the voids between nanowires and the transparent electrode with the conductive polymer poly-[3,4-(ethylenedioxy)-thiophene]: poly-(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The relatively high mobility of this organic conductor results in much higher photocurrents in photovoltaic cells, but results in a dip in the spectral response of the cells in the blue-green region due to light absorption in the conducting polymer. These materials show promise for efficient low-cost photovoltaic devices, but the cell geometry and materials interfaces will need to be optimized to reach their potential.

AB Nanocrystalline p-n junction diodes have been fabricated by using the metal-induced lateral crystallization (MILC) method, in which the Ni films were used to induce amorphous silicon into nanocrystalline. The effects of various thicknesses of Ni films on the material and electrical properties of the p-n junction diodes have been studied in detail. We found that the MILC films induced by 20 nm thick Ni exhibited the best crystallization, with an average grain size of 43.2 nm. The nanocrystalline p-n junction diodes prepared by this process demonstrated a low turn-on voltage of 0.44 V and a very high rectification ratio of 5469 at a +/- 2 V bias voltage. Thus, our developed p-n junction diodes are applicable in a solar cell. The current mechanism was dominated by the diffusion and recombination as a result of defect centers, caused by Ni-silicides, existing at the interface of the p-n junction diodes.

AB With nanotechnology becoming widely used, many applications such as plasmonics, sensors, storage devices, solar cells, nano-filtration and artificial kidneys require the structures with large areas of uniform periodic nanopatterns. Most of the current nano-manufacturing techniques, including photolithography, electron-beam lithography, and focal ion beam milling, are either slow or expensive to be applied into the areas. Here, we demonstrate an alternative and novel lithography technique-Nanosphere Photolithography (NSP)-that generates a large area of highly uniform periodic nanoholes or nanoposts by utilizing the monolayer of hexagonally close packed (HCP) silica microspheres as super-lenses on top of photoresist. The size of the nanopatterns generated is almost independent of the sphere sizes and hence extremely uniform patterns can be obtained. We demonstrate that the method can produce hexagonally packed arrays of hole of sub-250 nm size in positive photoresist using a conventional exposure system with a broadband UV source centered at 400 rim. We also show a large area of highly uniform gold nanoholes (similar to 180 nm) and nanoposts (similar to 300nm) array with the period of I pm fabricated by the combination of lift-off and NSP. The process is not limited to gold. Similar structures have been shown with aluminum and silicon dioxide layer. The period and size of the structures can also be tuned by changing proper parameters. The technique applying self-assembled and focusing properties of micro/nano-spheres into photolithography establishes a new paradigm for mask-less photolithography technique, allowing rapid and economical creation of large areas of periodic nanostructures with a high throughput.

AB In this study, we demonstrated the textured structure on silicon surface by metal assisted etching method, using An nanoparticles as catalysts in HF and H(2)O(2) solution. The size and density of the nanoparticles could be tuned easily. The porous layers filled with cylinder- or cone-shaped were uniformly formed by immersing the gold deposited silicon wafers in a mixed solution containing HF and H(2)O(2) under different etching conditions. The optimized textured structure was close-packed pyramids-like surface in subwavelength scale and showed the lowest reflectance less than 0.5% over whole visible and near IR wavelengths. The large reduction of reflectance was attributed from the gradient refractive index of the silicon surface with the depth along the light propagation.

AB Tandem solar cells using In(x)Ga(1-x)N heterojunctions with silicon as the active junction were fabricated using gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and by a novel deposition method incorporating an energetic nitrogen atom source. N-type InGaN layers were grown on p-Si(l 11) to evaluate predicted low-resistance tunnel junction properties. Ohmic behavior was observed, showing that these junctions can be used to connect the two pn subcells of an InGaN/Si tandem without the requirement of the heavily doped layers used in current multijunction cells. Undoped and Mg-doped films were grown by MBE on n-Si(111) using a AN buffer layer. Depletion is observed on the Si side of the junction and efficiencies approaching 5% were measured for this "hybrid" cell design. Conditions for achieving depletion on the p-InGaN and producing a "single-junction" tandem cell are discussed.

AB Boron back surface field is a promising replacement for the industry standard screen-printed Aluminum. However, the use of boron back surface fields is largely confined to laboratory scale solar cells. In order to increase its industrial applicability, we present a method for achieving a high quality boron back surface field using a cheap and safe boron source and short diffusion time. Metal contacts are fabricated using screen-printing, and degradation of rear passivation after contact firing is minimized through optimized screen-printing of local (point) contacts on the rear. On p-type silicon wafers, this process technology has been utilized to achieve, on 4 cm(2) cells, efficiency of up to 19.1% with open-circuit voltage of 650 mV.

AB Optical, structural and photovoltaic properties of amorphous carbon (a-C) thin films deposited on p-type silicon (p-Si) and quartz substrates by microwave (MW) surface-wave plasma (SWP) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were analyzed in this paper. Argon (Ar: 200 sccm) was used as carrier gas while acetylene (C(2)H(2): 20 sccm) and nitrogen (N: 0 and 10 sccm) were used as plasma source. Analytical methods such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy were employed to investigate the structural and optical properties of the a-C thin films respectively. The optical gaps of the films were tailored from 1.2 eV to 0.9 eV with nitrogen doping. Nitrogen doped a-C (a-C:N) thin film showed the photoconductivity action under white light illumination and hence Au/a-C:N/p-Si/Au heterojunction solar cell was fabricated with 0.23 V open circuit voltage, fill factor 25 and efficiency 5.7* 10(-3)%.

We use these methods, with an instrument from Sinton Consulting, as we fabricate and optimize state-of-the-art all hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) silicon heterojunction (SHJ) devices. For double-sided SHJ devices, lifetime measurements were performed immediately after hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) deposition of the front emitter and back base contacts on a Silicon wafer, and also after indium tin oxide (ITO) deposition of transparent conducting oxide contacts. We report results of minority carrier lifetime measurements for double-sided p-type Si heterojunction devices and compare Suns-Voc results to Light I-V measurements on 1-cm(2) solar cell devices measured on an AM1.5 calibrated XT-10 solar simulator.

AB We report on our approach for developing a potentially low-cost process for fabricating a p-n junction for a crystalline Si solar cell using a cheaper infrared laser. The proposed process was that dopants film and a carbon infrared absorption film were sequentially formed by spin-coating method on a Si wafer and then it was irradiated with the infrared laser, The process was applied to phosphorus doping in p-type single and multi-crystalline wafers. A low sheet resistance of less than 100 Omega/ was obtained for the phosphorus(P)-doped layers of both Si wafers. In addition, a p-n junction depth of 100 nm was achieved for the single crystalline wafer. Good-quality diode I-V characteristics were also obtained. As another approach, a p-n junction was fabricated by crystallizing a P-doped a-Si film formed on a Si substrate with the laser. A suitable condition for the crystallization was explored and it was applied to fabricating a simplified solar cell. The fabricated sample showed I-V characteristics as a solar cell under light illumination.

AB We propose a novel production method to fabricate high-efficiency thin-film poly-Si solar cells using flash lamp annealing (FLA) for crystallization of micrometer-order-thick p-i-n amorphous silicon (a-Si) structure, prepared by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Cat-CVD, Hot-Wire CVD) on low-temperature glass substrates and following high-pressure water vapor annealing for defect passivation. The FLA enables us to crystallize a-Si films with only one pulse of less than 10 ms duration, and use of Cat-CVD provides a-Si cost-effectively because of high deposition rate of a-Si over 10 nm/s. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) profiles reveal that diffusion of dopants in p- or n-type layers is sufficiently suppressed after FLA, indicating possibility of simultaneous crystallization of p-i-n stacked a-Si films. High-pressure water vapor annealing (HPWVA) enhances the minority carrier lifetime of the poly-Si up to about 10 mu s and drastically improves diode properties of the p-i-n poly-Si structure. No light-induced degradation is observed in the solar cell property of the poly-Si solar cell after 24-hour 1-sun light soaking.

ID MICROCRYSTALLINE SILICON
AB Nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) is an important material for solar cell applications. Thin films of nc-Si:H can be deposited cost-effectively using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and sputter deposition. While CVD method offer higher deposition rate and is commonly used in PV industry, microstructural properties (such as hydrogen incorporation, crystallinity, surface morphology, dopant incorporation) can be efficiently controlled using sputter deposition. While all the previous studies on sputter deposited nc-Si used crystalline Si (c-Si) sputter target, the current study compares the properties of nc:Si-H films using single and polycrystalline Si (p-Si) targets. P-Si is relatively inexpensive and easy to fabricate in bulk quantities. Several sets of nc-Si:H films were deposited using both c-Si and p-Si targets under similar conditions on glass substrates and characterized using TEM, XRD, AFM, UV-VIS spectroscopy and DC conductivity. Results indicate that surface morphology, size of nanocrystals, crystalline fraction, optical bandgap, coefficient of optical absorption and activation energy of samples were independent of sputter tar-get used. Preferred orientation of nanocrystallites for all the films was along (111) direction with a crystallite size of 4-10 nm. All the samples have wide optical band gap ranging between 2 and 2.1 eV. Comparable activation energies at low (< 370K) and high temperature (> 370K) regions was obtained and was attributed to carrier transport through nanocrystalline and amorphous phase of the films. These results indicate that nc-Si:H thin films for solar cell applications can deposited using low-cost p-Si targets in-lieu of conventional c-Si targets.

AB The introduction of selective emitters underneath the front contacts of solar cells can considerably increase the cell efficiency. Thus, cost-effective fabrication methods for this process step would help to reduce the cost per W(p) of silicon solar cells. Laser Chemical Processing (LCP) is based on the waterjet-guided laser (LaserMicroJet (R)) developed and commercialized by Synova S.A., but uses a chemical jet. This technology is able to perform local diffusions at high speed and accuracy without the need of masking or any high-temperature step of the entire wafer.
   We present experimental investigations on simple device structures to choose optimal laser parameters for selective emitter formation. These parameters are used to fabricate high-efficiency oxide-passivated LFC solar cells that exceed 20% efficiency.

AB A new method for reducing surface reflectance of multicrystalline silicon wafers is presented. The method using holographic lithography and wet etching to fabricate 2-dimensional (213) photonic crystal (PC) on the surface of multicrystalline silicon. 2D hexangonal PC structures with micron scale lattice constant exhibit significant reduction of the surface reflectance. In the method, 2D hexagonal PC structure is firstly recorded in photoresist, which is coated on the surface of Si wafer, using holographic 3-beam interference technique. After exposure and development the wafer is put into acid solution to transfer the lattice structure into the silicon. Experiments with different exposure angles and etching times were carried out to form different lattice period and structure depth for obtaining optimal lattice parameters. PC with 1.3 mu m lattice constant and 0.5 mu m depth has achieved a reflectance below 6%. The holographic technique used in the work allows large-area lattice fabrication with only one process. The proposed method has the advantages of low production cost and high throughput, enabling industrial mass production of Si solar cells.

AB Fe/Si multi-layer films were fabricated on Si ( 100) substrates utilizing the radio frequency magnetron sputtering system. Si/beta-FeSi2 structure was found in the films after the deposition. A series of characterization methods were employed, including transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, to explore the dependence of the microstructure of Si/beta-FeSi2 film on the preparation parameters. It was found that Si/beta-FeSi2 particles were formed after the deposition without annealing, whose size was less than 20 nm and the band-gap was 0.94 eV. After annealing at 850 degrees C, particles grew larger, however, the stability of thin films was still good.

AB Thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on microcrystalline silicon (c-Si: H) exhibit high charge carrier mobilities exceeding 35 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The devices are fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at substrate temperatures below 200 degrees C. The fabrication process of the mu c-S:H TFTs is similar to the low temperature fabrication of amorphous silicon TFTs. The electrical characteristics of the mu c-Si:H-based transistors will be presented. As the device charge carrier mobility of short channel TFTs is limited by the contacts, the influence of the drain and source contacts on the device parameters including the device charge carrier mobility and the device threshold voltage will be discussed. The experimental data will be described by a modified standard transistor model which accounts for the contact effects. Furthermore, the transmission line method was used to extract the device parameters including the contact resistance. The modified standard transistor model and the transmission line method will be compared in terms of the extracted device parameters and contact resistances.

AB In an effort to develop low-cost solar energy conversion techniques, high uniformity vertically oriented silicon wire arrays have been fabricated. These arrays, which allow for radial diffusion of minority charge carriers, have been measured in a photoelectrochemical cell. Large photovoltages (similar to 400 mV) have been measured, and these values are significantly greater than those obtained from the substrate alone. Additionally, the wire array samples displayed much higher current densities than the underlying substrate, demonstrating that significant energy conversion was occurring due to the absorption and charge-carrier transport in the vertically aligned Si wires. This method therefore represents a step toward the use of collection-limited semiconductor materials in a wire array format in macroscopic solar cell devices.

AB This paper describes a simple and effective method to fabricate various shapes and profiles of three-dimensional (3-D) silicon microstructures using a shape-controllable 3-D lithography along with dry plasma etching. The first step is to fabricate 3-D photoresist patterns with various slopes and round profiles on a silicon substrate by the shape-controllable 3-D lithography using polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) films, which is compatible to conventional lithography process. The second step is to transfer the sloping photoresist patterns into the silicon by etching 3-D photoresist molds and the silicon surface through inductively coupled plasma (ICP) process successively. The proposed microfabrication method for 3-D silicon microstructures can be widely applied for silicon lens arrays and silicon solar cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Poly-Si thin-film solar cells fabricated on glass superstrates via the aluminium-induced crystallisation solid-phase epitaxy (ALICE) method, where an aluminium-induced crystallisation (AIC) poly-Si seed layer is thickened via solid-phase epitaxy (SPE) of a-Si:H, are investigated. For comparison, solar cells made by solid-phase crystallisation (SPC) of a-Si:H are also investigated. In both cases, the a-Si:H films are deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) vapour. The structural quality, as determined by Raman and ultraviolet (UV) reflectance measurements, of ALICE diodes is found to be superior to that of SPC diodes. Sheet resistance profiling of n-type ALICE and p-type SPC diodes reveals that the Al doping of the AIC poly-Si layer, which is designed to function as a p(+) emitter in n-type ALICE diodes, is almost completely neutralised during the high-temperature hydrogenation process. In contrast, the n(+) (phosphorus) emitter of the p-type SPC diodes is not neutralised appreciably by the same hydrogenation process. To overcome the problem with Al-doped emitters, an ALICE structure with an n+ AIC poly-Si emitter and a p-type base (glass/SiN/n(+)p(-)p(+)) is suggested and experimentally investigated. The doping in the n(+) emitter of ALICE cells is found to be essentially unaffected by the hydrogenation process. Open-circuit voltages of up to 480 mV are achieved for p-type ALICE cells with an n(+) ATC poly-Si emitter. These voltages seem to be the highest reported so far for poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass featuring an AIC poly-Si seed layer. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spherical Si crystals for solar cell substrates have been successfully fabricated by a dropping method. In the dropping method, melted Si droplets were instilled at normal pressure or in the decompression state (0.5 atm) to control the cooling rate of the spherical Si, dominating crystal quality parameters such as dislocation density in crystal grains. Differences in the crystal quality of the spherical Si crystals were analyzed by surface observation with scanning electron microscopy after Dash etching. Through our baseline process, spherical Si solar cells were fabricated using spherical Si crystals with a diameter of I min fabricated in the decompression state. The current-voltage measurement of the solar cell showed an energy conversion efficiency of 11.1% (short-circuit current density: 24.7 mA/cm(2), open-circuit voltage: 601 mV, fill factor: 74.6%). These results indicated that spherical Si crystals fabricated by the dropping method have a great potential for the substrate material of high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells.

AB Spherical silicon (Si) with a size of similar to 1 mm diameter was fabricated by the dropping method for the applications of spherical Si solar cells. In this research work, we characterized spherical Si by means of photoluminescence (PL) measurement at 4 and 18 K. The horn-type spherical Si crystals, formed under large undercooled conditions without a seeding technique, showed D-band luminescence originating from dislocations, whereas intrinsic PL bands of Si were not observed. In contrast, for the tear-type spherical Si crystals, formed under shadow undercooling by a seeding technique with Si powder, the boron (B) bound and Si intrinsic phonon-assisted PL bands were clearly observed both at 4 and 18 K. Moreover, the intensity ratio of B bound exciton band to Si intrinsic phonon-assisted PL band showed good correlation to the minority carrier lifetime measured with microwave photoconductance decay method. These experimental results suggested that the crystallinity of the tear-type spherical Si is significantly improved by the seeding technique compared with the horn-type ones, which contain a large amount of B-related defects.

AB High gain AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors grown on SiGe/Si substrate have been fabricated. Measured peak dc current gain of similar to 100 is obtained for a device with emitter area of similar to 1.6 x 10(3) mu m(2), with base concentration of 1 x 10(19) cm(-3). The dominant base current component is discussed and determined. The breakdown characteristic is studied and compared with that of the device grown on GaAs substrate.

ID COUPLED-WAVE ANALYSIS
AB We demonstrate a simple method, which is combining modified illumination and defocus techniques to fabricate sub-wavelength antireflective structures for solar cells. The optimum pyramid resist and silicon profiles can be obtained after exposure, development and common dry etching processes. The reflection and transmission properties are analyzed by the rigorous coupled-wave analysis in two-dimensional microstructure and find the reflectance is dramatically increased as consideration of all diffraction orders. Therefore, patterning the sub-wavelength texturing structures for eliminating the diffraction order light is important. Patterning sub-wavelength structures should use the short wavelength combining defocus exposure or using a suitable modified illumination exposure system. The optimized pyramid structures are simulated in dosage-focus matrix with different types of light source. Results show the quadrupole modified illumination system with large process latitude is suitable for patterning sub-wavelength pyramid structures. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The in situ formation of an emitter in monocrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells by solid-state diffusion of dopants from the growth substrate during epitaxy is demonstrated. This approach, that we denote autodiffusion, combines the epitaxy and the diffusion into one single process. Layer-transfer with porous silicon (PSI process) is used to fabricate n-type silicon thin-film solar cells. The cells feature a boron emitter on the cell rear side that is formed by autodiffusion. The sheet resistance of this autodiffused emitter is 330 Omega/rectangle. An independently confirmed conversion efficiency of (14 center dot 5 +/- 0 center dot 4)% with a high short circuit current density of (33 center dot 3 +/- 0 center dot 8) mAlcm 2 is achieved for a 2 X 2 CM2 large cell with a thickness of (24 +/- 1) gm. Transferred n-type silicon thin films made from the same run as the cells show effective carrier lifetimes exceeding 13 mu s. From these samples a bulk diffusion length L > 111 mu m is deduced. Amorphous silicon is used to passivate the rear surface of these samples after the layer-transfer resulting in a surface recombination velocity lower than 38cm/s.

AB Chemical bath deposition (CBD) has been used to deposit. lms of metal sulfides, selenides and oxides, together with some miscellaneous compounds, beginning nearly 140 years ago. While it is a well-known technique in a few specific areas (notably photoconductive lead salt detectors, photoelectrodes and more recently, thin film solar cells), it is by and large an under-appreciated technique. The more recent interest in all things 'nano' has provided a boost for CBD: since it is a low temperature, solution (almost always aqueous) technique, crystal size is often very small. This is evidenced by the existence of size quantization commonly found in CBD semiconductor films. The intention of this review is to provide readers, many of whom may not even be aware of the CBD technique, with an overview of how the technique has been used to fabricate nanocrystalline semiconductor (this terminology also includes oxides often classified as ceramics) films and some properties of these films. The review begins, after a short introduction, with a general description of the CBD method, designed to give the reader a basic knowledge of the technique. The rest of the review then focuses on nanocrystalline (or, in the few cases of amorphous deposits, nanoparticle) films. The various factors which determine crystal size are first discussed. This is followed by some of the many examples of size quantization observed in the films. Since CBD films are usually porous, surface effects can be very important, and various surface-dependent properties (light emission and surface states) as well as surface modication, are treated: (although some properties, like emission, can be strongly dependent on both surface and 'bulk'). Because of the fact that many CBD films have been made specifically for use as photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical cells, there is next a chapter on this topic with a few examples of such photoelectrodes. Film structure and morphology follows with examples of patterning, porosity and crystal shape. The review concludes with some of the author's opinions as to what the near future holds for CBD development in general.

AB We are reporting high performance silicon heterojuncton (SHJ) solar cells fabricated using the hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) technique. On p-type c-Si float-zone wafers, we used an amorphous n/i contact to the top surface and an i/p contact to the back surface to obtain an open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.67 V in a 1 cm(2) cell with an independent confirmed efficiency of 18.2%. This is the best reported p-type SHJ solar cell, at least by IfWCVD. On n-type c-Si float-zone wafers, we used an amorphous (p/i) front emitter and an a-Si:H (i/n) back contact to achieve a V-oc of 0.69 V on 1 cm(2) cell. We found that proper c-Si surface cleaning prior to the amorphous Si deposition and double-heterojunction is a key to the high V-oc. In the heterojunction region, an abrupt interface from c-Si to a-Si:H results in a high V-oc; while incorporating a transition to either microcrystalline or epitaxial Si at the c-Si interface results in a low V-oc. Lifetime measurement shows that the back surface recombination velocity can be reduced to similar to 15 cm/s through a-Si:H passivation. Amorphous silicon heterojunction layers on crystalline wafers thus combine low-surface recombination velocity with excellent carrier extraction. The advantages of using HWCVD in comparing with plasma-enhanced CVD are the fast deposition rate and, more important, a wide range of deposition parameters enabling formation of an effective heterojunction with high V-oc. Further, the heterojuction cell processing is entirely below 200 degrees C making it one of the few promising low-stress methods for the manufacturing of next generation ultra-thin Si wafer solar cells.

AB Antireflection coatings have been fabricated by self-assembly using silica nanoparticles. The ionic selfassembled multilayer (ISAM) films are tightly packed and homogeneous. While the geometric properties of a matrix of spherical particles with corresponding void interstices are highly suitable to meet the conditions for minimal reflectivity, it is also a cause for the lack of cohesion within the constituent body, as well as to the substrate surface. This study investigates methods for improving the interconnectivity of the nanoparticle structure. One such method involves UV curing of diazo-resin (DAR)/silica nanoparticle films, thereby converting the ionic interaction into a stronger covalent bond. Factorial analysis and response surface methods are incorporated to determine factors that affect film properties, and to optimize their optical and adhesive capabilities. The second study looks at the adhesive strength of composite multilayer films. Films are fabricated with silica nanoparticles and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and dipped into aqueous solutions of PAH and poly(methacrylic acid, sodium salt) (PMA) to improve cohesion of silica nanoparticles in the matrix, as well as binding strength to the substrate surface. The results of the two studies are discussed.

AB Hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) thin films have attracted many attentions due to the high mobility compared with the amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films. To fabricate pc-Si:H thin films, plasma-enhance chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is the most popular method. The disadvantages of PECVD are the high facility cost and using the toxic processing gases such as silane (SiH4). Whereas there is no these disadvantages using radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering to deposit silicon thin films. Unfortunately, the silicon thin films deposited by the regular RF magnetron sputtering are a-Si. In this study, pc-Si:H thin films were fabricated using RF magnetron sputtering with argon and hydrogen as working gas at low substrate temperature (T-s=250 degrees C and 350 degrees C). The grain sizes, crystal volume fractions and photosensitivity (ratios of dark conductivities and photo conductivities) of the pc-Si:H thin films which deposited with different hydrogen partial pressures and sputtering powers were analyzed. The results showed that the grain sizes and the crystal volume fractions were increased and the photosensitivity was decreased as the hydrogen partial pressure increased at the sputtering power 200W. The grain size was between 15 to 20 nm and the crystal volume fractions was between 75 to 80% when the hydrogen partial pressure was over 90%.
