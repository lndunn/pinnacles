AB In this work we have reported low cost solar cells which can be processed to scalability by depositing direct and uniform films using airbrushing, inkjet printing, or spin-coating techniques. We have synthesized single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition (cCVD) method, which were subsequently doped with boron for photovoltaic applications. The carbon nanotubes were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The solar cell devices were fabricated by depositing a uniform dispersion of b-SWNT films on n-Si creating numerous heterojunctions. These studies are the first in which b-SWNTs have been utilized directly for photo-generation.

AB In this work, we demonstrate a thorough device design, fabrication, characterization, and analysis of biomimetic antireflective structures implemented on a Ga0.5In0.5P/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell. The sub-wavelength structures are fabricated on a silicon nitride passivation layer using polystyrene nanosphere lithography followed by anisotropic etching. Both the reflectance spectroscopy and external quantum efficiency measurements confirm the improved optical absorption in the ultraviolet/blue and near-infrared wavelengths. Hence, the conversion efficiency of cell with sub-wavelength structure (SWS) is enhanced by 46.1% and 3.4% due to much improved current-matching, compare to cells without an ARC and SL ARC, respectively. We further employ RCWA method to analyze the reflectance by tuning structural factors such as periodicity or height of the SWS.

The system was designed with high throughput, low energy cost, and high utilization of precursors, thus enabling extremely low cost Si epitaxial film for photovoltaic application. The system will be capable of processing a large batch of > 320 wafers in less than an hour. The novel system architecture effectively utilizes resources such as electricity and process gases, and the processing cost can be as low as $0.22 per wafer for 50 mu m deposition. Initial results confirmed good power utilization and excellent film properties. As an example of application, solar cells have been fabricated with epitaxial films on wafers from ingots pulled from metallurgical Si in Czochralski method.

AB The presented work is part of the French PHOTOSIL project which deals with the purification of metallurgical grade (MG) silicon to obtain Solar Grade (SoG) silicon by a combination of innovative refinement/up-grading techniques such as segregation and plasma purification. The main objectives of this project are production costs <15(sic)/kg, a photovoltaic performance of >15% solar cell efficiencies, and material yields >85% after crystallization.
   In this paper we present the latest results obtained with a intensely purified metallurgical silicon via a modified PHOTOSIL process. Chemical analysis by Glow Discharge Mass Spectroscopy (GDMS) on this purified Silicon revealed a boron concentration below 0.5ppmw after the plasma treatment and a phosphorus concentration close to 1ppmw after the metallurgical purification by segregation. The total amount of metallic impurity concentrations has been reduced below 2ppmw (Fe, Al, etc...) thanks to the successive segregation steps.
   A multicrystalline silicon ingot from 100% of this purified metallurgical silicon was crystallized using an innovative crystallization method. It was p-type on 80% of its height and exhibited a resistivity range between 1-10 ohm. cm, due to the segregation of the remaining phosphorus. For reference purposes, a second ingot was crystallized in identical conditions using intrinsic EG silicon, that was intentionally boron-doped to 1ohm.cm.
   Solar cells have been processed on 12.5x12.5 cm(2) wafers from both ingots using industrial type standard screen printed processes at the CEA-INES. The solar cell process that has been applied to the PHOTOSIL wafers has been specially optimized for purified metallurgical grade Silicon. In case of the EG ingot the average efficiency was 16.3% with a maximum of 17%. In case of the ingot from PHOTOSIL silicon, solar cells from the p-type region have reached an average efficiency of 15.7 % including a best cell with 16.2 %.
   In addition, a 6" Cz ingot was crystallized from the same purified silicon feedstock. This ingot turned out to be entirely mono-crystalline which confirms the very low impurity content of the Silicon after purification. Solar cells were fabricated on 12.5x12.5 cm(2) pseudo-square wafers and a high average efficiency of 17,4% was reached with a maximum efficiency of 17,6%, which is one of the highest efficiency reported so far if not the highest on purified metallurgical silicon.
   These results clearly demonstrate the potential of the metallurgical silicon route for application in PV and the possibility to reach high efficiencies.

AB A novel method for producing a highly-(100) orientated, large grain of poly-Si seed layer on glass by multi-round aluminum-induced crystallization (AIC) is developed. A flat 200nm poly-Si layer was first fabricated by regular AIC process to be a based layer. The second round AIC process was carried out immediately on the based layer to epitaxially grow up to a 400nm poly-Si layer by solid phase epitaxy (SPE) mechanism. The structure of enlarged epitaxial grain was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the orientation map as well as histogram of grain size from large area were performed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and the crystallinity of multi-round AIC was verified by Raman spectrometry. The lateral growth and grain suppression can be clearly observed in cross-sectional TEM analysis. The average grain size can be determined from analysis of histogram.
   The speed of epitaxial growth is strongly influenced by the orientation of the growth plane. We utilize this characteristic to promote the {100} proportion and reduce others to achieve a highly oriented seed-layer for followed thickening step. The population of {100} crystallographic plane is obtained statistically from orientation map and a pole figure analysis. The mechanism of the multi-round AIC will be discussed in detail in the conference.

AB The influence of thickness of optimized Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO) front contact layer on an efficiency of a radial p-n junction silicon (Si) solar cell has been studied. Vertically aligned Si wire arrays for the radial p-n junction solar device were fabricated by metal catalytic etching and p-n junction was prepared by spin-on-dopant (SOD) diffusion method. AZO thin films as a top contact layer were conformally deposited on the radial p-n junction Si solar cell by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. To determine the best conversion efficiency, the thickness of AZO thin film varied from 15 nm to 80nm.
   Both short circuit current (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (eta) of the cell increased as the thickness of AZO film is changed from 15nm to 48nm, but decreased at the AZO thicknesses exceeding 48nm. The conversion efficiency of the best sample is 5.6% and Jsc of 22.2mA/cm(2), when the thickness of AZO front contact is 48nm. It is considered that the optimized AZO contact layer plays a role of increasing photocurrent by lowering contact resistance and surface recombination centers.

AB We characterized polycrystalline silicon films produced by aluminum-induced layer exchange (ALlLE) for the various thicknesses of an aluminum oxide layer. The pc-Si film is fabricated by the ALiLE process with a structure of glass/Al/Al2O3/a-Si for application to a seed layer of polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) solar cells using dc and RF sputtering, and PECVD methods, respectively. For investigation of the effects of oxide film thickness on the crystallinity in the ALiLE process, the thickness of Al2O3 was varied from 4 to 50 nm including native oxidation in the ambient atmosphere. For characterization OM, SEM, Raman spectroscopy analyses are carried out. As results, the crystallinity was exponentially decayed with increase of Al2O3 thickness. Also, the grain size is decreased with increase of Al2O3 layer thickness. The maximum pc-Si grain size of about 60 mu m is obtained at the relatively thin oxide layer. The preferential crystal orientation was (111) and more dominant for the thinner Al2O3 layers.
   In this work the effects of Al2O3 film thickness on the crystallization properties of a-Si by ALiLE process are closely demonstrated such as grain size, preferential crystal orientation, and crystallinity.

AB We describe results of our theoretical and experimental studies performed to investigate the influence of defects and defect distributions in multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers on the solar cell's performance. Dislocation distributions were measured on wafers from various bricks of a mc-Si ingot. Solar cells were fabricated on sister wafers and characterized by a variety of methods. Cell performance can be accurately predicted from dislocation distribution of a mc-Si wafer using local N/P junction characteristics in a distributed network model. This analysis is applied to investigate changes in cell performance caused by dislocation propagation within a brick of mc-Si ingot. The theoretical results agree well with the measured performance of cells fabricated on wafers taken from different places in a brick.

AB Silicon nanowires have been shown to have strong light trapping properties making them a promising photovoltaic material. In this study, silicon nanowires, grown by RF plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), are incorporated as the absorbing layer in n-i-p solar cells. Silicon nanowires are fabricated at a temperature of 375 degrees C by Vapor Liquid Solid (VLS) method. Nanowire solar cells have an average specular reflectance of 6.3% as compared to 22.6% for the thin film amorphous silicon (a-Si) device (over lambda = 350 nm - 750 nm). Similarly the average diffuse reflectance of the nanowire devices is 4.9% as compared to 9.4% for the thin film a-Si device. External quantum efficiency measurements indicate the largest contributor to collection efficiency losses is from the catalyst impurity used for nanowire growth.

AB We have fabricated Si quantum dot-sensitized solar cells by three assembling methods; the conventional method and two novel methods in which Si nanoparticles/TiO2 blend paste is coated onto FTO glass, or TiO2 film. The highest current density is realized s solar cell for which Si nanoparticles/TiO2 blend paste is coated onto TiO2 films. The result indicates that excitons generated in Si nanoparticles are separated into electrons and holes and such carriers are extracted to the outer circuit. Photon-to-current conversion efficiency (PCE) of our Si quantum dot-sensitized solar cells is larger than that of the cell without Si nanoparticles in a wavelength range below 500nm. It suggests that carrier generation in the Si nanoparticles is realized in the wavelength range less than 500 nm in the solar cell. Light intensity dependence of photo-current density shows superliner one for photon energy larger than twice of the bandgap energy of the Si nanoparticles.

AB The pyramid-like texture ZnO thin films were usually synthesized by MOCVD or etching the as-prepared RF magnetron sputtering films, and the expensive equipment cost and uncontrollable acid etching, respectively are two main disadvantages both the MOCVD and RF magnetron sputtered. In this paper, the pyramid-like texture ZnO thin films were prepared through a low-cost two-step process, firstly, a seed ZnO:Al layer was coated on the quartz substrates by sol-gel method and subsequently a ZnO thin film was fabricated by RF magnetron sputtered. It is shown from the XRD and SEM results that the ZnO thin film has (101) preferential orientation with a pyramid-like texture. According to the measurement results of ZnO films' resistivity and UV-Visible transmission spectra, the lower resistivity of 10(-3) Omega.cm and optical transmission of higher than 80 % were obtained for these ZnO films. It has shown that the pyramid-like ZnO thin film is a potential transparent conductive film used in amorphous silicon solar cell for front electrode, and the cell performance is comparable advantages for that of ITO conductive film.

AB Surface texturing is well known as one of the major paths to improving the efficiency of silicon solar cells by increasing the short circuit current through effective photon trapping. However, the effects of the pyramids created after surface texturing on the other properties remain obscure. In this work, we studied the effect of the Surface morphologies on the formation of both the emitter layer and metal electrode using the screen printing method, which is a cost-effective method of fabricating silicon solar cells. Various textured surfaces, such as with large, small, sharp or smooth pyramids, were investigated in comparison with a flat Surface. The contact resistance was measured from a TLM patterned cell by I-V measurement under dark conditions and SEM, TEM and UV-vis spectrophotometer were used to evaluate the surfaces.

AB The effect of high pressure pure hydrogen annealing (HPHA) on the conversion efficiency of multicrystalline silicon solar cells was investigated at various temperatures and pressures. HPHA led to a better supply of hydrogen near the interface between the Ag electrode and the SiN antireflection layer of a solar cell, resulting in increased cell conversion efficiency. As compared with an as-fabricated sample, the postannealed samples in pure hydrogen ambient under optimum process conditions exhibited the improved cell conversion efficiency by 2% absolute. HPHA is a useful method to enhance the conversion efficiency of low grade multicrystalline silicon solar cells. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10.1149/1.3485082] All rights reserved.

AB This study reports broadband antireflective subwavelength structures (SWS) on various semiconductor materials for near-infrared detector applications. Two fabrication methods are proposed, i.e., a lenslike shape transfer and an overall dry etch process of Ag nanoparticles. These methods provide relatively simple, fast, inexpensive process steps, which is applicable for practical device applications. The fabricated SWS showed extremely lower reflectance spectra compared to that of flat surface in the near-IR range, indicating good agreement with the simulation results. We also propose amorphous silicon SWS on InGaAs photodetector to enhance the absorption efficiency.

AB Nanostructured thin films is one of the highly exploiting research areas particularly in applications such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and sensor technologies. Highly tuned thin films, in terms of thickness, crystallinity, porosity and optical properties, can be fabricated on different substrates using the sol-gel method, chemical solution deposition (CSD), electrochemical etching, along with other conventional methods such as chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and physical vapour deposition (PVD). The above mentioned properties of these films are usually characterised using surface analysis techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, AFM, ellipsometry, electrochemistry, SAXS, reflectance spectroscopy, STM, XPS, SIMS, ESCA, X-ray topography and DOSY-NMR. This article presents a short review of the preparation and characterisation of thin films of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide and modified silicon as well as their application in solar cells, water treatment, water splitting, self cleaning fabrics, sensors, optoelectronic devices and lab on chip systems.

AB The subject of the present work is to develop a simple and effective method of enhancing conversion efficiency in large-size solar cells using multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafer. In this work, industrial-type mc-Si solar cells with area of 125 x 125 mm(2) were acid etched to produce simultaneously POCl3 emitters and silicon nitride deposition by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD). The study of surface morphology and reflectivity of different mc-Si etched surfaces has also been discussed in this research. Using our optimal acid etching solution ratio, we are able to fabricate mc-Si solar cells of 16.34% conversion efficiency with double layers silicon nitride (Si3N4) coating. From our experiment, we find that depositing double layers silicon nitride coating on mc-Si solar cells can get the optimal performance parameters. Open circuit (V-oc) is 616 mV, short circuit current (J(sc)) is 34.1 mA/cm(2), and minority carrier diffusion length is 474.16 mu m. The isotropic texturing and silicon nitride layers coating approach contribute to lowering cost and achieving high efficiency in mass production.

AB We inexpensively fabricated vertically aligned Si nanowire solar cells using metal-induced electroless etching and a novel doping technique. Codoping of boron and phosphorus was achieved using a spin-on-doping method for the simultaneous formation of a front-side emitter and a back surface field in a one-step thermal cycle. Nickel electroless deposition was also performed in order to form a continuous metal grid electrode on top of an array of vertically aligned Si nanowires. A highly dense array of Si nanowires with low reflectivity was obtained using Ag nanoparticles of optimal size (60-90 nm). We also obtained an open circuit voltage of 544 mV, a short circuit current of 14.68 mA/cm(2), and a cell conversion efficiency of 5.25% at 1.5AM illumination. The improved photovoltaic performance was believed to be the result of the excellent optical absorption of the Si nanowires and the improved electrical properties of the electroless deposited electrode.

AB The optical properties of the silicon naniwires (SiNWs) fabricated by a method of metal-assisted electroless etching have been investigated. The optical parameters of both SiNWs and the Si wafer, including dielectric function (epsilon(omega)) and the effective refractive index (N(omega)), could be obtained from the light-absorption theory and Kramers-Kronig relation. From the comparation of calculated characteristics, we can observe that the refractive index of the SiNWs is reduced to 1.26 while that of Si wafer is changing from 2.4 to 6.2 in the range of 1.5-4eV, and the imaginary part of complex dielectric constant of Si NWs is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of Si wafer. There are two peak positions in the curve of Si wafer, while just one broad peak position in that of Si NWs. These differences could be considered as the reasons for the special characteristic of the Si NWs.

The raw material silicon as one of the Earth's most abundant resources elements, have the advantage of non-toxic, no pollution, no radiation, high photoelectric conversion efficiency, stability and reliability of optical performance become the main raw material for production of solar cells. Because of its supply is limited, We used relatively inexpensive metallurgical grade silicon as a starting material to produce solar grade silicon for solar cells is considered relatively inexpensive method. Therefore, the removal of impurities from metal silicon witch reduce solar cell carrier lifetime and thus reducing its power generation efficiency is a significant issue. To this end, according to impurities in molten silicon and solid silicon demonstrated various characteristics and existence forms, in this paper we used acid leaching, directional solidification, electron and magnetic field, vacuum melting, blow reactive gases and so on to fabricate solar grade silicon from metal silicon in theory to analyze and optimize process.

AB A solar cell has been fabricated by different anti-reflection coating methods, ZnO/SiO(2), TiO(2)/SiO(2) and porous silicon. Surface morphology and structural properties of nanostructured silicon were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic forces microscopy (AFM) images. Optical reflectance was obtained by using optical reflectometer (Filmetrics-F20). Current-Voltage (I-V) measurements of the fabricated solar cell were taken under 80 mW/cm2 illumination conditions. The results showed the porous silicon an excellent reduction anti-reflection coating for reflection incident light compare with a different anti-reflection coating processes as well as a good light-trapping of wide wavelength spectrum which led to produce a solar cells high efficiency.

AB Exposed facets of n-type silicon nanowires (Si NWs) fabricated by a top-down approach are successfully terminated with different organic funcitonalities, including 1,3-dioxan,2,ethyl, butyl, allyl, and propyl-alcohol, using a two-step chlorination/alkylation method. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry establish the bonding and the coverage of these molecular layers. Field-effect transistors fabricated from these Si NWs displayed characteristics that depended critically on the type of molecular termination. Without molecules the source-drain conduction is unable to be turned off by negative gate voltages as large as -20 V. Upon adsorption of organic molecules there is an observed increase in the "on" current at large positive gate voltages and also a reduction, by several orders of magnitude, of the "off" current at large negative gate voltages. The zero-gate voltage transconductance of molecule-terminated Si NW correlates with the type of organic molecule. Adsorption of butyl and 1,3-dioxan-2-ethyl molecules improves the channel conductance over that of the original SiO(2)-Si NW, while adsorption of molecules with propyl-alcohol leads to a reduction. It is shown that a simple assumption based on the possible creation of surface states alongside that attachment of molecules may lead to a qualitative explanation of these electrical characteristics. The possibility and potential implications of modifying semiconductor devices by tuning the distribution of surface states via the funtionality of attached molecules are discussed.

AB As the global demand for low-cost renewable energy sources intensifies, interest in new routes for converting solar energy to electricity is rapidly increasing. Although photovoltaic cells have been commercially available for more than 50 years, only 0.1% of the total electricity generated in the United States comes directly from sunlight, The earliest commercial solar technology remains the basis for the most prevalent devices in current use, namely, highly-ordered crystalline, inorganic solar cells, commonly referred to as silicon cells.
   Another class of solar cells that has recently inspired significant academic and industrial excitement is the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) "plastic" solar cell. Research by a rapidly growing community of scientists across the globe is generating a steady stream of new insights into the fundamental physics, the materials design and synthesis, the film processing and morphology, and the device science and architecture of BHJ technology. Future progress in the fabrication of high-performance BHJ cells will depend on our ability to combine aspects of synthetic and physical chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science.
   In this Account, we use a combination of characterization tools to tie together recent advances in BHJ morphology characterization, device photophysics, and thin-film solution processing, illustrating how to identify the limiting factors in solar cell performance. We also highlight how new processing methods, which control both the BHJ phase separation and the internal order of the components, can be implemented to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE).
   The failure of many innovative materials to achieve high performance in BHJ solar cell devices has been blamed on "poor morphology" without significant characterization of either the structure of the. phase-separated morphology or the nature of the charge carrier recombination. We demonstrate how properly controlling the "nanomorphology", which is critically dependent on minute experimental details at every step, from synthesis to device construction, provides a clear path to > 10% PCE BHJ cells, which can be fabricated at a fraction of the cost of conventional solar cells.

Surface morphology and structural properties of porous silicon have been studied by using scanning electron microscopy and atomic forces microscopy images. Optical reflectance was obtained by using optical reflectometer. I-V characterization of fabricated solar cell was investigated. The results showed that the solar cell efficiencies were 2.76 % for pyramids, 3.34 % for acidic solutions and 11.23 % for porous silicon. Porous silicon texturing revealed an excellent reduction in the reflection of incident light compared with different texturing processes, with a good light-trapping of wide wavelength spectrum, which could produce high efficiency solar cells.

AB Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin films have been prepared by electron-beam evaporation and thermal annealing for the development of thin-film solar cells on glass coated with ZnO:Al as a transparent, conductive layer. The poly-Si microstructure and photovoltaic performance were investigated as functions of the deposition temperature by Raman spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopies including defect analysis, x-ray diffraction, external quantum efficiency, and open circuit measurements. It is found that two temperature regimes can be distinguished: Poly-Si films fabricated by deposition at low temperatures (T-dep < 400 degrees C) and a subsequent thermal solid phase crystallization step exhibit 1-3 mu m large, randomly oriented grains, but a quite poor photovoltaic performance. However, silicon films deposited at higher temperatures (T-dep > 400 degrees C) directly in crystalline phase reveal columnar, up to 300 nm big crystals with a strong < 110 > orientation and much better solar cell parameters. It can be concluded from the results that the electrical quality of the material, reflected by the open circuit voltage of the solar cell, only marginally depends on crystal size and shape but rather on the intragrain properties of the material. The carrier collection, described by the short circuit current of the cell, seems to be positively influenced by preferential < 110 > orientation of the grains. The correlation between experimental, microstructural, and photovoltaic parameters will be discussed in detail. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3240343]

AB The p-i-n type mu c-Si:H solar cells were prepared in a single chamber using very high frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique. Boron cross-contamination between p-layer and subsequent i-layer seriously affects the device performance. The effects of p-seeding on the mu c-Si:H i-layers and performance of lie-Si: H solar cells were investigated. The p-seeding method was mainly realized by relatively high hydrogen rich plasma. It has been demonstrated that p-seeding can improve the characteristics of p/i interface and the vertical uniformity of the intrinsic layer and reduce boron contamination. Through the optimization of p-seeding layer technique, a-Si:H/mu c-Si:H tandem solar cell with 8.81% (1 cm(2)) conversion efficiency has been fabricated in single chamber.

AB Vertically aligned large-area p-Cu2O/n-AZO (Al-doped ZnO) radial heterojunction nanowire arrays were synthesized on silicon without using catalysts in thermal chemical vapor deposition followed by e-beam evaporation. Scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that poly-crystalline Cu2O nano-shells with thicknesses around 10 nm conformably formed on the entire periphery of pre-grown Al:ZnO single-crystalline nanowires. The Al doping concentration in the Al: ZnO nanowires with diameters around 50 nm were determined to be around 1.19 at.% by electron energy loss spectroscopy. Room-temperature photoluminescence spectra show that the broad green bands of pristine ZnO nanowires were eliminated by capping with Cu2O nano-shells. The current-voltage (I-V) measurements show that the p-Cu2O/n-AZO nanodiodes have well-defined current rectifying behavior. This paper provides a simple method to fabricate superior p-n radial nanowire arrays for developing nano-pixel optoelectronic devices and solar cells.

AB Spherical Si single crystals with a diameter of approximately I mm were grown by melting for solar cell applications. The start sources were spherical Si multicrystals fabricated by a dropping method, which had various irregular shapes. Spherical Si multicrystals were melted into droplets and recrystallized on a quartz plate sample holder that was coated with Si(3)N(4). It was found that a surface coating Of SiO(2) layer on the start sources and oxygen atmosphere during melting and recrystallization were essential to achieve almost perfect spherical shape. Defect-free single crystalline spherical Si could be obtained at recrystallization temperature ranging from 1400 to 1330 degrees C, corresponding to an undercooling ranging from 14 to 84 degrees C, with a yield of nearly 100%. At recrystallization temperatures higher than 1380 degrees C, the recrystallized spherical Si crystals were almost perfect spheres, whereas small protuberances were formed when the recrystallization temperature was lower than 1360 degrees C. It was also found that that melting at a temperature close to the melting point of Si (at similar to 1414 degrees C), a slow cooling rate of similar to 1 degrees C/min before recrystallization and relatively fast cooling rate of similar to 20 degrees C/min after recrystallization were important for achieving high carrier lifetime. The average carrier lifetime was greatly improved from lower than 2.5 mu s of start sources up to similar to 7.5 mu s by melting at optimized conditions. The influences of residual oxygen on the carrier lifetime of recrystallized spherical Si are discussed based on the measurement results with Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.

AB A new method for patterning the rear passivation layers of high-efficiency solar cells with a mechanical scriber has been developed and successfully adapted to fabricate high-efficiency passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC). Three types of the rear contact patterns: dot patterns with a photolithography process, line and dashed line patterns with a mechanical scriber process have been processed in order to optimize the rear contact structure. An efficiency of 19.4% has been achieved on the mechanical-scribed (MS)-PERC solar cell on 0.5 Omega cm p-type FZ-Si wafer and is comparable to that of conventional PERC solar cells fabricated by using photolithography process. The mechanical scriber process shows great potential for commercial applications by achieving high efficiency above 20% and by significantly reducing the fabrication costs without an expensive photolithography process. Low-cost Ni/Cu metal contact has been formed by using a low-cost electroless and electroplating. Nickel silicide formation at the interface enhances stability and reduces the contact resistance resulting in an energy conversion efficiency of 20.2%, on 0.5 Omega cm FZ wafer.

This pattern with its special shape and size serves as an anti-reflective layer. To form a pattern on the PVC film, the hot-embossing method was used. Moreover, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film patterned on both sides was also fabricated to improve the performance of anti-reflection functionality. A solar cell with a patterned PVC film as a protective layer exhibited higher quantum efficiency and total conversion efficiency than a solar cell with a bare PVC film as a protective layer.

AB A simple and cost-effective approach for texturing crystalline silicon wafers is proposed. The advantage over conventional texturization processes is the fact that no surfactant is added in alkaline etchants. Hydrogen bubbles, regarded as residuals in conventional texturization processes, are utilized in this approach as etch masks on a silicon surface. This is accomplished by placing a metal grid with suitable openings on silicon wafers to confine the hydrogen bubbles created during etching. Pyramids with a size ranging from 6 to 9 mu m are uniformly fabricated using this method. Without antireflection coating, an average weighted reflectance of 15.1% is achieved.

SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS

DT Article
ID EXCIMER LASER
AB The laser-doping technique in silicon solar cell fabrication is now attracting considerable attention because of its suitability for the low-cost processing of high-efficiency silicon solar cells; it can be performed at room temperature in air and intricate doping areas can be formed easily. In this study, we used a laser with a UV wavelength (355 nm) instead of the conventionally used laser with 532 nm wavelength to form property-controlled doping regions for the emitter or back surface field (BSF) of silicon solar cells at room temperature in air. The doping depth of phosphorus or boron was precisely controlled in the shallow region under 0.3 mu m depth by changing the laser output power, remaining a high doping concentration at the silicon surface. The photovoltaic performance depended strongly on the doping conditions, and the best cell with a laser-doped emitter showed almost the same open circuit voltage and short circuit current as those of a cell fabricated by the conventional thermal diffusion method. In addition, all photovoltaic properties were enhanced by the formation of a laser-doped BSF layer. The problem of a lower fill factor still remained because of the high sheet resistance caused by laser damage, inhomogeneous doping, or the unintentional incorporation of oxygen and/or carbon atoms. However, the utility of the laser-doping technique was clearly shown; silicon solar cells were fabricated below 100 degrees C.

AB Copper nano-ink with a drop-on-demand (DOD) piezoelectric inkjet printing method was introduced. The printed electrodes were thermally sintered to ensure high-quality electrical and mechanical performances. To check the reliability of the printed electrodes on a polymer layer, resistance changes were measured under static loading. The electrodes with various widths and thicknesses were used to find the optimal dimensions. A multifunctional composite laminate which can harvest and store a solar energy was fabricated using printed electrodes. An amorphous silicon solar cell and a thin film solid state lithium-ion battery were adhesively joined and electrically connected to a thin flexible printed circuit board (PCB). Then, the passive components such as resistor and diode were electrically connected to the printed circuit board by silver pasting. The integrated PCB was co-cured with a carbon/epoxy composite laminate by the vacuum bag molding process in an autoclave. The structural and functional performance of the final energy harvesting/storage composite laminate was tested under mechanical loading. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To answer the challenge of less expensive renewable electricity, the photovoltaics community is focusing on producing thinner silicon solar cells. A few years ago, in the field of silicon-on-nothing structures, micron-thick monocrystalline layers suspended over their parent wafer were produced by high-temperature annealing of specific arrays of macropores. Those macropores reorganise into one single void and leave a thin overlayer on top. Since this method may be an inexpensive way of fabricating high-quality silicon films, this paper investigates its potential for photovoltaic applications. In particular, we investigated if large surfaces can be produced and transferred to foreign substrates with this method. We fabricated basic solar cells, without rear-surface passivation, on 5 cm x 5 cm-large and 1-mu m-thick films transferred to glass, that showed energy-conversion efficiencies up to 2.6%. These cells demonstrate the feasibility of the presented concept as a layer-transfer process for solar-cell application. After formation by annealing, the film is only barely attached to its parent wafer, but can still safely be handled provided that any abrupt gas flow or pumping to vacuum is avoided. After transfer and permanent bonding, the sample can be handled as any bulk wafer. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An innovative method, namely ultrafast plasma surface melting, is developed to fabricate solid films of silicon with very high rates (150 cm(2)/min). The method is composed of preparing a suspension of solid particles in a volatile solvent and spreading it on a refractory substrate such as Mo. After solvent evaporation, the resulting porous layer is exposed to the flame tale of inductively coupled RF plasma to sinter and melt the surface particles and to prepare a solid film of silicon. It is shown that by controlling the flow dynamics and heat transfer around the substrate, and managing the kinetic parameters (i.e., exposure time, substrate transport speed, and reaction kinetics) in the reactor, we can produce solid crystalline Si films with the potential applications in photovoltaic cells industry. The results indicate that the optimum formation conditions with a film thickness of 250-700 mu m is when the exposure time in the plasma is in the range of 5-12.5 s for a 100 x 50 mm large layer. By combining the Fourier's law of conduction with the experimental measurements, we obtained an effective heat diffusivity and developed a model to obtain heat diffusion in the porous layer exposed to the plasma. The model further predicts the minimum and maximum exposure time for the substrate in the plasma flame as a function of material properties, the porous layer thickness and of the imposed heat flux.

AB n-ZnO/p-silicon nanowire (SiNW) photodiodes were prepared by radio frequency reactive magnetron sputtering of n-type zinc oxide at room temperature on photoresist filled p-SiNWs, which were fabricated by electroless metal deposition method at 323 K. Our n-ZnO/p-SiNW photodiodes showed good temperature- and light-intensity dependence. They exhibited strong responsivities of 19.2 and 2.5 A/W for 254 and 1000 nm photons, respectively, under a reverse bias of 2 V with a strong peak of responsivity near 390 nm, the wavelength corresponding to the band gap of ZnO. These results present potential applications of n-ZnO/p-SiNW photodetectors in deep ultraviolet and near infrared regions.

AB An efficient suppression of reflection in a broad spectral range can be achieved when the textured scale is comparable to the wavelength of incident light. The nano-scale texturing method is, therefore, attracting many interests in many fields. In this study, a fast nano-scale texturing method for the crystalline silicon substrate has been provided. By using the self-assembly polymer mask and wet chemical etching, an almost uniform low reflectance can be achieved. The self-assembly polymer mask was fabricated by coating the pre-prepared polymer solution onto silicon substrate followed by suitable heat treatment. In addition to being technologically easy, the process is also inexpensive.

AB We present a novel method for the industrial fabrication of a silicon solar cell that features an oxidepassivated rear surface. The SiNTO process (Silicon Nitride Thermal Oxidation) utilizes a SiN(X) layer for masking the front side of the solar cell during the thermal oxidation process. This masking layer prevents the oxidation of the textured and phosphorus-doped emitter surface and limits the growth of the thermal oxide to the uncoated rear surface. After oxidation the SiN(X) layer remains at the front side of the cell and serves as an anti-reflection coating (ARC). In this work we investigate the impact of the thermal oxidation process on the SiN(X) film and the underlying emitter and analyze the passivation quality of the thermal oxide. The oxidation process results in a sufficiently passivated rear surface with a surface recombination velocity of similar to 40 cm/s, measured after Al-metallization and post-metallization anneal. Measurements of the emitter sheet resistance and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) profiling reveal that the SiN(X)-coated emitter reorganizes slightly during the oxidation process whereas an uncoated reference is strongly affected. The emitter dark saturation current density is affected as well. Oxide-passivated solar cells are fabricated from Czochralski (Cz) silicon using the SiNTO approach. A 136 cm(2) large cell fabricated using industrial processing equipment reaches an efficiency of 17.8% (stable), which demonstrates the feasibility of the SiNTO process.

AB The ever increasing need for more efficient utilization of solar energy at higher concentration levels in today's power technology; create a need for effective cooling methods to improve the dissipation heat flux level from concentrated solar cells. The present research is targeted at cooling small area, high concentration solar cells which are desired because of their higher electrical efficiency at higher concentration of solar flux.
   A novel manifold microchannel heat sink with high heat transfer coefficient was fabricated and tested. Manifold and microchannel are etched in two separate silicon substrates and eutectically bonded together to form a sealed heat sink. Compared to conventional microchannels, manifold microchannel provides less pressure drop due to short microchannels length, while allowing the redevelopment of thermal boundary layer in each channel to obtain high heat transfer coefficients.
   The microchannels can be directly microfabricated and integrated on the backside of the silicon solar cell and with a manifold fabricated in another silicon substrate; it can form a sealed beat sink. This type of designs not only minimizes the pressure drop, but also maximizes the heat transfer with eliminating the thermal interface resistance between the heated area and the heat sink.
   The experimental results suggest that the present heat sink can provide high heat transfer coefficients with only moderate pressure drops. Experimental results showed that a heat transfer coefficient of 65480 W/m(2)K can be achieved at a flow rate of 1.1 gr/s and heat flux of 75 W/cm(2) using water as the working fluid. Since for all cases the flow is in thermal entry region, Nusselt number is not constant and it is shown that Nusselt number is correlated with Reynolds number to the power of 0.62.

AB Photonic crystal based back-reflectors are an attractive solution for light management and enhancing optical absorption in thin film solar cells, without undesirable losses. We have fabricated prototype photonic crystal back-reflectors using photolithographic methods and reactive-ion etching. The photonic crystal back-reflector has a triangular lattice symmetry, a thickness of 250 nm, and a pitch of 765 nm. Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrate high quality long range periodicity. An a-Si: H solar cell device was grown on this back-reflector using standard PECVD techniques. Measurements demonstrate strong diffraction of light and high diffuse reflectance by the photonic crystal back-reflector. The photonic crystal back-reflector increases the average photon collection by similar to 9% in terms of normalized external quantum efficiency, relative to a reference device on a stainless steel substrate with an Ag coated back surface.

ID BUFFER LAYER; GROWTH
AB We fabricated highly transparent and high haze ZnO:Al film for front TCO of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon solar cells. We have sputtered ZnO: Al film of 1.3 mu m on the thin seed layer of about 80nm which was previously sputtered on the glass substrate by using 4% dilution of oxygen to argon gas. The ZnO: Al film grown on the seed layer had much higher crystalline phase than one without any seed layer. Our bi-layer ZnO: Al film showed low resistivity of 2.66x10(-4) Omega.cm and sheet resistance of 2.08 Omega/square while conventional ZnO: Al film showed resistivity of 3.24x10(-4) Omega.cm and sheet resistance of 2.46 Omega/square. After surface texturing by 0.5% HCl wet-chemical etching, the transmittance of ZnO: Al film was increased from 83.7% to 88.1% at wavelength of 550nm through the seed layer. Also the transmittance at 800nm was increased from 82.3% to 88.9%. Especially, haze values of the ZnO: Al film were drastically increased from 58.7% to 90.6% at wavelength of 550nm by employing the seed layer. Also haze values at 800nm were increased from 22.1% to 68.1%. It is expected that the seed layer method to improve the quality of ZnO: Al film will contribute to an increase of solar cell efficiency due to the high capability of light trapping and low electrical resistivity.

AB Transparent Oxide Semiconductors based on nanocrystalline thin films with desirable electrical and optical properties, are important in applications for transparent electronics. Such thin films can be applied, among others, as active layers in transparent transistors, UV photodiodes or solar cells. In this article, the presented subject of research are the thin films based on TiO(2) doped with Tb and Pd. The thin films were deposited on glass and silicon substrates by the magnetron sputtering method. Structure of the TiO(2):(Tb,Pd) thin films was investigated by the X-ray powder diffraction. Electrical measurements allowed the analysis of conduction mechanisms in fabricated thin films. From thermoelectrical characteristics conductivity, a type of electrical conduction, the activation energy and the Seebeck coefficient were determined. On the basis of current to voltage characteristics the power dependence I similar to U(m) was found for structures consisted of the thin films deposited on silicon. This behaviour indicates a conduction mechanism known as (SCLC). Additionally, from the temperature dependence of the current density, the trap concentration and the characteristic temperature were estimated.

AB A systematic structural analysis was carried out on amorphous silicon films prepared from hydrogen-diluted silane using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Hydrogen dilution of silane during the growth of a-Si: H absorber layers is used to suppress light-induced degradation of a-Si: H solar cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that for higher hydrogen dilution ratios the growth of films becomes strongly inhomogeneous and the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline phase occurs at a smaller thickness. A detailed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the amorphous films reveals that the strongest peak in the XRD patterns is located around 27.5 degrees and corresponds to the signal from the ordered domains of tetragonal silicon hydride and not from cubic silicon crystallites. The full width at half maximum of this peak narrows from 5.1 degrees to 4.8 degrees as the ratio of hydrogen to silane flow (R) increases to 20 and does not change significantly for higher hydrogen dilutions. The presence of silicon hydride ordered domains in amorphous films is confirmed by the lattice imaging method applied to the high resolution TEM recordings. The amorphous silicon films fabricated at different hydrogen dilution were applied as absorber layers in single-junction solar cells. The degradation experiment confirms that the cells with absorber layers deposited using hydrogen dilution are more stable to light exposure. A clear reduction of the degradation is observed when the dilution ratio is increased from R 0 to R = 20. The degradation of solar cells with absorber layers prepared at R > 20 is not reduced by further increasing R.

AB Nanocrystalline silicon films have been deposited using RF and VHF (54.24 MHz) plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) methods. The effects of plasma excitation frequency, plasma power density, chamber pressure, hydrogen dilution of silane and total gas flow-rates on the structural properties of nanosilicon films have been investigated. For all films prepared under different conditions, grain size varied in the range 5-14.4nm and crystalline volume fraction varied in the range 21-86%. Films with low microstructure factor have been developed successfully using a 54.24-MHz plasma excitation frequency at high total gas flow-rate and optimum power-pressure. Single junction cells have been fabricated using the nanocrystalline silicon films with different crystallinity.

AB A novel ultrafast laser texturing method has been developed to produce arrays of nano/micro surface textures in silicon. Laser processing conditions have been optimized for achieving appropriate optical and electronic properties for photovoltaic applications. The textured silicon surfaces absorb greater than 99% of incident light over the entire solar spectrum and the material appears complete black to bare eye. Textured silicon surfaces are characterized for surface morphology and optical properties. Chemical etching and thermal annealing steps have been performed to remove laser slag and induced defects. Finally, we report the total and external quantum efficiency results on photovoltaic devices fabricated on the textured silicon wafers, which can be further improved.

AB Nanowires have been identified as a promising alternative for future electronics. A single coaxial nanowire photovoltaic device has been fabricated to power up nanoelectronic sensors and logic gates. The current work calculates and analyses the performance of the coaxial silicon nanowire using a semi-classical method. The current-voltage characteristics are calculated for both under dark and AM1.5G illumination. Some interesting phenomena is observed from the two-dimensional plot of the potential. Furthermore, the effect of the surface recombination, which is significant in nanoscale devices, is also studied.

AB Spin casting polymer blends of conjugated and dielectric macromolecules onto chemically patterned metal and oxidized silicon surfaces might provide a simple method to fabricate polymer-based circuitries that can be integrated with conventional electronics. Such solution-processing of the blend components offers simultaneous deposition and pattern-directed alignment of the phase separated polymer domains. The alignment is driven by self-organization guided by preferential surface segregation. Here we demonstrate that the laterally arranged domain structures in spin cast films of the conjugated poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs): P3BT, P3DDT and regioregular R-P3HT, blended with dielectric polystyrene (PS), can be ordered by three different surface templates. The templates are formed by a patterned self-assembled monolayer (SAM), micro-contact printed on the surface of interest, i.e. hexadecanethiols on gold (for alignment of P3DDT/PS blend) and octadecyltrichlorosilanes on oxidized silicon (for R-P3HT/PS). Additionally gold lines are micro-patterned on SiO2 with photo-lithography (for P3BT/PS mixture). The forces driving pattern-directed self-organization of the polymers are discussed based on complementary studies of preferential surface segregation, observed for blend films spin cast on homogeneous surfaces that correspond to the different regions of the surface templates.
