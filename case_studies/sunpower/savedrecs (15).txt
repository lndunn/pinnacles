AB Carrier transport characteristics in high-efficiency single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)/silicon (Si) hybrid solar cells are presented. The solar cells were fabricated by depositing intrinsic p-type SWNT thin-films on n-type Si wafers without involving any high-temperature process for p-n junction formation. The optimized cells showed a device ideality factor close to unity and a record-high power-conversion-efficiency of >11%. By investigating the dark forward current density characteristics with varying temperature, we have identified that the temperature-dependent current rectification originates from the thermally activated band-to-band transition of carriers in Si, and the role of the SWNT thin films is to establish a built-in potential for carrier separation/collection. We have also established that the dominant carrier transport mechanism is diffusion, with minimal interface recombination. This is further supported by the observation of a long minority carrier lifetime of similar to 34 mu s, determined by the transient recovery method. This study suggests that these hybrid solar cells operate in the same manner as single crystalline p-n homojunction Si solar cells.

AB In this work, solar cells fabricated from 100% upgraded metallurgical grade (UMG) silicon refined by a novel metallurgical route have been investigated. Compared with Siemens mc-Si solar cells, the UMG mc-Si solar cells fabricated in the same process present higher open voltages and fill factors, together with low initial light-induced degradation due to the material properties. By secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements, the UMG mc-Si solar cells show shallower and better single-side abrupt junctions, resulting in higher photoelectric conversion in the wave band from 400 nm to 750 nm as external quantum efficiency measurements demonstrated. Although higher impurity content limits the minority carrier diffusion length, leading to lower shot-circuit current density, the average efficiency of the UMG-Si solar cells fabricated in standard production line is up to 16.55%, close to 16.69% of the reference solar cells. Furthermore, by an additional phosphorous gettering process, the mean efficiency of the UMG-Si solar cells increases to 16.68%, and the reverse characteristics of the corresponding cells have been significantly improved.

In order to analyze non-uniform film by AIC, a new method to evaluate the poly-Si thin film average crystalline volume fraction is proposed, based on the optical microscope and Raman spectroscopy results. This method can obtain more accurate crystallization fraction than the common way. X-ray diffraction results showed that the films are strongly (1 1 1) orientated. A new region crystallization pattern in AIC was also proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We fabricate Silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays for solar-cell applications on 6-inch wafers employing metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch). It can reduce cost and energy consumption. However it is difficult to make uniform SiNW arrays on large size wafer. Here we demonstrate a simple method to achieve a uniform SiNW on 6 inch wafers. Moreover, optical properties and surface morphologies of 6 inch N-type pyramid/SiNW arrays and 6 inch P-type as-cut/SiNW arrays are investigated. Reflectance indicates the extensive light-trapping effect by the SiNW arrays. Thus, the improved MacEtch method is promising for future commercial mass production on large size wafers.

AB Titania electrode films of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) were prepared by cone-jet mode electrostatic atomization spraying a titanium ethoxide precursor solution onto a silicon substrate. The effects of spraying time, substrate temperature and aging on the surface morphology of the films prepared were studied. Thin films obtained after spraying for 600s were aged at room temperature to form a porous TiO2 network with pores in the size range of 100-500 nm. Thicker films were prepared by spraying for 3000s, but these cracked on drying although it can be concluded that films prepared using a higher substrate temperature were denser. By this method, TiO2 films were also prepared on an ITO conductive glass substrate using titania suspension with different particle size distribution. The result implies the potential of an industrial production of DSSC by electrospraying technique.

AB In this paper we use the 3D TCAD Sentaurus workbench from Synopsis to simulate the photovoltaic performance of Silicon Nanowire Arrays (SiNWAs) with a rough surface, as fabricated by metal assisted chemical etching and a core-shell pn junction, as obtained via spin-on-doping (SOD) diffusion. The roughness is imposed by a Gaussian autocorrelation function while the Sentarus process tool simulates the doping profile as a function of diffusion time, temperature and initial SOD concentration. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is used to simulate both electrical and optical characteristics. The results show that the highest carrier generation occurs in the core and thus the depth of the junction should be strictly controlled by sub 900 degrees C doping diffusion with high doping concentration in the SOD. The roughness of the wires reduces the reflectivity of a 2 mu m long NWA to less than 2%. Using optimised junction depth and rough NWAs shows that the core-shell pn junction within the wire increases the efficiency by approximately 2%.

AB In this study, we propose a new, facile and efficient method to define the desired patterns on Si surfaces and to fabricate periodic arrays of size-and position-controllable Si nanoholes on blank-and pre-patterned (0 0 1)Si substrates, which is based on the O-2 plasma modified nanosphere lithography with an anisotropic wet etching technique. In contrast to earlier approaches, no additional thin-film deposition equipments and metal film hard masks are needed for this method. The Si nanohole arrays exhibit the same hexagonal arrangement as the initial colloidal nanospheres template. The sizes of the Si nanoholes can be tuned from 150nm to 480nm by varying the etching time. The Si substrates with nanohole-textured surfaces exhibit strong antireflection properties. UV-Vis spectroscopic measurements revealed that by increasing the nanohole size, the optical reflectance of the nanohole-structured (0 0 1)Si surfaces was gradually decreased down to less than 8 %. Since the nanohole sizes, shapes and spacings can be readily controlled by adjusting the diameters of the colloidal nanospheres and anisotropic wet etching conditions, the combined approach presented here provides the capability to fabricate a variety of nanohole array structures on various Si-based substrates without complex lithography.

   GROWTH; GAAS; NANOPARTICLES
AB Semiconductor nanowires are key building blocks for the next generation of light-emitting diodes(1), solar cells(2) and batteries(3). To fabricate functional nanowire-based devices on an industrial scale requires an efficient methodology that enables the mass production of nanowires with perfect crystallinity, reproducible and controlled dimensions and material composition, and low cost. So far there have been no reports of reliable methods that can satisfy all of these requirements. Here we show how aerotaxy, an aerosol-based growth method(4), can be used to grow nanowires continuously with controlled nanoscale dimensions, a high degree of crystallinity and at a remarkable growth rate. In our aerotaxy approach, catalytic size-selected Au aerosol particles induce nucleation and growth of GaAs nanowires with a growth rate of about 1 micrometre per second, which is 20 to 1,000 times higher than previously reported for traditional, substrate-based growth of nanowires made of group III-V materials(5-7). We demonstrate that the method allows sensitive and reproducible control of the nanowire dimensions and shape-and, thus, controlled optical and electronic properties-through the variation of growth temperature, time and Au particle size. Photoluminescence measurements reveal that even as-grown nanowires have good optical properties and excellent spectral uniformity. Detailed transmission electron microscopy investigations show that our aerotaxy-grown nanowires form along one of the four equivalent < 111 > B crystallographic directions in the zincblende unit cell, which is also the preferred growth direction for III-V nanowires seeded by Au particles on a single-crystal substrate. The reported continuous and potentially high-throughput method can be expected substantially to reduce the cost of producing high-quality nanowires and may enable the low-cost fabrication of nanowire-based devices on an industrial scale.

TI Effective Panchromatic Sensitization of Electrochemical Solar Cells:
   Strategy and Organizational Rules for Spatial Separation of
   Complementary Light Harvesters on High-Area Photoelectrodes

AB Dye-sensitized solar cells, especially those comprising molecular chromophores and inorganic titania, have shown promise as an alternative to silicon for photovoltaic light-to-electrical energy conversion. Co-sensitization (the use of two or more chromophores having complementary absorption spectra) has attracted attention as a method for harvesting photons over a broad spectral range. If implemented successfully, then cosensitization can substantially enhance photocurrent densities and light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies. In only a few cases, however, have significant overall improvements been obtained. In most other cases, inefficiencies arise due to unconstructive energy or charge transfer between chromophores or, as we show here, because of modulation of charge-recombination behavior. Spatial isolation of differing chromophores offers a solution. We report a new and versatile method for fabricating two-color photoanodes featuring spatially isolated chromophore types that are selectively positioned in desired zones. Exploiting this methodology, we find that photocurrent densities depend on both the relative and absolute positions of chromophores and on "local" effective electron collection lengths. One version of the two-color photoanode, based on an organic push pull dye together with a porphyrin dye, yielded high photocurrent densities (J(sc) = 14.6 mA cm(-2)) and double the efficiency of randomly mixed dyes, once the dyes were optimally positioned with respect to each other. We believe that the organizational rules and fabrication strategy will prove transferrable, thereby advancing understanding of panchromatic sensitization as well as yielding higher efficiency devices.

AB Hydrogenated amorphous silicon germanium (a-SiGe:H) thin films were prepared by a 13.56-MHz plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. The optical, optoelectronic, and microstructure properties of the a-SiGe: H thin films prepared with different plasma powers were investigated systematically by transmission, photo/dark conductivity, Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements. It was found that when the deposition pressure was high and the hydrogen (H-2) dilution ratio ([H-2]/([SiH4]+[GeH4])) was low, an appropriate high plasma power could enlarge the optical bandgap (E-g) by reducing the Ge content in the thin film, enhance the film photosensitivity by improving the film microstructure, and increase the film growth rate. As a demonstration, excellent a-SiGe: H thin film with E-g of 1.5 eV, the photosensitivity of above 10(4) and a growth rate of 6.6 angstrom s(-1) was successfully fabricated for the solar-cell application with a plasma power density of 400 mW cm(-2), a deposition pressure of 3 Torr, and a H-2 dilution ratio equal to 3 at 220 degrees C. The underlying mechanism was further analyzed. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

ID LIQUID-PHASE EPITAXY; LATERAL OVERGROWTH; MODEL; GAAS
AB Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (ELO) is a method of epitaxial growth on a partially masked substrate. It can be a promising method for photovoltaic applications due to a possibility of producing thin and high quality silicon substrates. Since the mask prevents propagation of the substrate dislocations to the laterally overgrown parts of the ELO layer they are characterized by a lower dislocation density than the substrate. It means that it is possible to fabricate good quality solar cells on a poor quality Si substrate. The main goal of the research is to obtain a higher growth rate in the lateral direction than in the direction normal to the substrate. The epilayer growth kinetics depends on many technological factors, basically the growth temperature, the cooling rate, the solvent and the mask filling factor. For this reason the best way to achieve the goal is a computational analysis of the epitaxial layer growth process. This work presents a two-dimensional computational study of such a process of growth for different technological conditions. The computational model is based on the assumption of pure diffusion control growth.

AB This paper presents an acidic texturing and a novel vapor texturing method for Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG) multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. P-type EFG mc-Si wafers with resistivity 0.5-2 Omega cm and thickness of 300 +/- 70 mu m were textured with acidic solution using HF:HNO3:CH3COOH. The reflectance decreased as the acid etching proceeded and then saturated when the etching depth reached 10 mu m. The isotropic etching of acid texturing resulted in minimum reflectance of 13%. For vapor texturing, the vapor particles were generated by adding silicon to HF:HNO3 acidic solution. Initially silicon was oxidized with HNO3 vapor particles. The nano-pore sized SiF62- ion formed over the EFG mc-Si wafer acted as a barrier on the Si surface. The HF vapor particles then dissolved the formed SiO2 effectively by passing through the nano-pores of SiF62- ion and etched the EFG mc-Si wafer. The anisotropic etching of vapor textured wafers resulted in an etching depth of about 2.78 mu m with reflectance of 5%. The EFG mc-Si solar cell fabricated with acid texturing had V-OC of 592 mV, J(SC) of 27.71 mA/cm(2) and efficiency of 12.85% while the cell with novel vapor texturing showed V-OC of 597 mV, J(SC) of 29.61 mA/cm(2) and efficiency of 13.54%.

AB A novel table-top, microreactor-assisted nanomaterial deposition (MAND (TM)) process, which combines the merits of microreaction technology with solution-phase nanomaterial synthesis and film deposition, was used to grow a nanostructured ZnO anti-reflective coating on a textured silicon substrate from aqueous solution. The subwavelength, anti-reflective nanostructures mimicked the structure and performance of the surface of the eye from a night-flying moth. Solution-processed Ag nanoparticles were applied as a seed layer on the textured silicon surface leading to preferred heterogeneous nucleation and good area coverage. Preferential growth of the nanostructured ZnO was controlled by changing residence time, reaction temperature, and concentration of precursor solution without the use of a buffer reagent (e.g. HMTA). Well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays were fabricated by MAND at a very high deposition rate (i.e. 125 nm min(-1)) compared to batch hydrothermal method. The surface reflection of the polished silicon was suppressed from an average of 30.8% between wavelengths of 400 and 900 nm to 10.6% after micro-scale pyramidal surface texturing to 3.4% after application of the ZnO nanostructure on the textured silicon. The results provide a potential economical path to broadband anti-reflection (AR) for silicon wafers and solar cell substrates.

AB The reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance of GaAs nanowire (NW) arrays are calculated by solving Maxwell's equations using the finite element method. The model is compared with measurement results from well-ordered periodic GaAs NW arrays fabricated by dry etching. The model results are also compared with the reflectance measured from NWs grown by the Au-assisted vapor-liquid-solid method. The optimum NW diameter, periodicity (spacing between NWs), and length are determined to maximize absorptance of the AM1.5G solar spectrum and short circuit current density in a NW array solar cell. The optimum NW diameter, period, and length were 180 nm, 350 nm, and 5 mu m, respectively, giving a photocurrent density from the NW of 27.3mA/cm(2) and corresponding to 91.3% absorption of the AM1.5G solar spectrum. The photocurrent density saturated for NW lengths greater than 5 mu m. A gold nanoparticle at the top of the NWs (used in the vapor-liquid-solid NW growth process) substantially reduced the optimum photocurrent density, while a polymer filling the space between NWs and a planar indium tin oxide contact had a relatively minor influence.

The recrystallization step is carried out by Zone Melting Recrystallization (ZMR) or Full Wafer Recrystallization (FWR). Structural analysis and impurity content of the processed material are presented. Electrical characterization shows that mobility reaches values of 150 and 250 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in samples recrystallized by FWR and ZMR with P-type doping of 5 x 10(16) and 3 x 10(17) at/cm(3). The lifetime reaches values around 1 mu s. After solar cell fabrication, a conversion efficiency of 8.9% is obtained by using a simplified process without texturing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB We demonstrated fabrication of black silicon with slanted nanocone array on both planar and 3D micro- and mesoscale structures produced by a high-throughput lithography-free oblique-angle plasma etching process. Nanocones with gradual change in height were created on the same piece of silicon. The relation between the slanted angle of nanocones and incident angle of directional plasma is experimentally investigated. In order to demonstrate the monolithic integration of nanostructures on micro- and mesoscale nonplanar surfaces, nanocone forest is fabricated on nonplanar silicon surfaces in various morphologies such as silicon atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips and pyramidal pits. By integrating nanocones on inverse silicon micropyramid array devices, we further improved the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SEAS) enhancement property of this optimized commercial SERS substrate by severalfold even when using 66% less noble metal coating. We investigated the length gradient dependence and asymmetric properties of SERS effects for slanted nanocone with polarized excitation. This versatile and angle controllable nanocone fabrication and monolithic 3D nano micro meso integration method provides new dimensions for production and optimization of SERS and other nanophotonic sensors.

AB Non-metallic particles and metallic impurities present in the feedstock affect the electrical and mechanical properties of high quality silicon which is used in critical applications such as photovoltaic solar cells and electronic devices. SiC particles strongly deteriorate the mechanical properties of photovoltaic cells and cause shunting problem. Therefore, these particles should be removed from silicon before solar cells are fabricated from this material. Separation of non-metallic particles from liquid metals by imposing an electromagnetic field was identified as an enhanced technology to produce ultra pure metals. Application of this method for removal of SiC particles from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) was presented. Numerical methods based on a combination of classical models for inclusion removal and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were developed to calculate the particle concentration and separation efficiency from the melt. In order to check efficiency of the method, several experiments were done using an induction furnace. The experimental results show that this method can be effectively applied to purifying silicon melts from the non-metallic inclusions. The results are in a good agreement with the predictions made by the model.

DE diffraction; crystalline silicon solar cells; gratings; light trapping;

AB In this paper, we present guidelines for the design of backside gratings for crystalline silicon solar cells. We use a specially developed method based on a combination of rigorous 3D wave optical simulations and detailed semiconductor device modeling. We also present experimental results of fabricated structures. Simulation-based optimizations of grating period ? and depth d of a binary grating and calculations of the optical and electrical characteristics of solar cells with optimized gratings are shown. The investigated solar cell setup features a thickness of dbulk?=?40?mu m and a flat front surface. For this setup, we show a maximum increase in short-circuit current density of Delta jSC?=?1.8?mA/cm(2) corresponding to an efficiency enhancement of 1% absolute. Furthermore, we investigate different loss mechanisms: (i) an increased rear surface recombination velocity S-0,(b) because of an altered surface caused by the introduction of the grating and (ii) absorption in the aluminum backside reflector. We analyze the trade-off point between gain due to improved optical properties and loss due to corrupted electrical properties. We find that, increasing the efficiency by 1% absolute due to improved light trapping, the maximum tolerable recombination velocity is S-0,(b(max))=5.2x103cm/s. From simulations and measurements, we conclude that structuring of the aluminum backside reflector should be avoided because of parasitic absorption. Adding a dielectric buffer layer between silicon and the structured aluminum, absorption losses can be tuned. We find that for a planar reflector, the thickness of a SiO2 buffer layer should exceed d(SiO2)=120nm. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An approved measurement method for evaluating space charge region recombination (SCR-recombination) induced by the screen printed front side metallization is applied for industrial solar cells with aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) on monocrystalline Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si). The H-patterned base grid of all processed solar cells is screen printed with a commercially available front side silver paste, ensuring sufficiently good contacting and therefore good electrical performance of the solar cells. Additionally, irregular contact fingers are realized between the regular contact fingers of the base grid by applying different screen printing layouts with commercially available front side pastes to increase the front side metallization fraction linearly as well as by applying various test pastes for the layout with the highest metallization fraction. Well-known components of glass frits as lead oxide, zinc oxide, bismuth oxide and boron oxide can affect SCR-recombination. Therefore we fabricated test pastes with these specific paste/glass frit components. By applying this test structure, a comparable qualitative evaluation of SCR-recombination with respect to the specific paste component is demonstrated. Quantitative evaluations regarding the electrical performance of the solar cells as well as related microstructural investigations are presented. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Si nanowires (NWs) integrated in a field effect transistor device structure are characterized using scanning electron (SEM), atomic force, and scanning Kelvin probe force (KPFM) microscopy. Reactive ion etching (RIE) and vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth were used to fabricate NWs between predefined electrodes. Characterization of Si NWs identified defects and/or impurities that affect the surface electronic structure. RIE NWs have defects that both SEM and KPFM analysis associate with a surface contaminant as well as defects that have a voltage dependent response indicating impurity states in the energy bandgap. In the case of VLS NWs, even after aqua regia, Au impurity levels are found to induce impurity states in the bandgap. KPFM data, when normalized to the oxide-capacitance response, also identify a subset of VLS NWs with poor electrical contact due to nanogaps and short circuits when NWs cross that is not observed in AFM images or in current-voltage measurements when NWs are connected in parallel across electrodes. The experiments and analysis presented outline a systematic method for characterizing a broad array of nanoscale systems under device operation conditions.

AB Industrial applicable fine-line double printing and nickel plating method was applied to single crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. As the finger widths decreased, the efficiency and short circuit current density (J(sc)) linearly increased. Although the increase of the J(sc) was caused by the reduction of shadowing loss due to the decrease of finger width, the fill factor (FF) was slowly decreased due to increase of contact resistance. The FF of the cells using the fine line was enhanced by using a double printing and nickel plating. c-Si solar cells with the dimensions of 12.5 cm x 12.5 cm, double printed finger width of 50 mu m due to spreadability of paste, a finger spacing of 2.4 mu m, and aluminum back surface field were fabricated, achieving an increase of J(sc) and efficiencies of up to about 0.62 mA/cm(2) and 0.38% compared to a reference cell at 79.8% of the FF, respectively.

AB Two types of Schottky diodes, with and without PVA (Ni-doped) layer, were fabricated to investigate whether or not the PVA (Ni-doped) layer is effective on some electrical parameters such as ideality factor n, barrier height Phi(B0), series resistance R-s, and interface state density N-SS. PVA (Ni-doped) microdrops film was deposited on n-type silicon substrate. SDs with and without PVA (Ni-doped) layer, namely MPS and MS diodes, respectively, were investigated by current-voltage (I-V) measurements at room temperature. Also, series resistance calculations have been performed using Cheung method. The values of n and R-s obtained for MPS are found higher compared to those of MS. This is attributed to the particular distribution of N-SS, and inhomogeneity of barrier height and interfacial layer at metal/semiconductor (M/S) interface. Au/PVA(Ni-doped)/n-Si diode (MPS) exhibits a photovoltaic behavior with an open circuit voltage V-oc 0.42 V and short-circuit current I-SC 33.2 mu A under 100 mW/cm(2) illumination intensity. The obtained photovoltaic results indicate that the MPS diode can be used as an efficient material for applications in optoelectronic applications such as solar cells and photodiode devices.

AB The integration of silver 1D gratings as light trapping method on both wafer-based and thin-film flat silicon solar cells has been investigated by EM field numerical simulations. The far field scattering properties or the near field enhancement and coupling to guided modes have been respectively studied in combination with thick (200 mu m) and thin (100 nm) absorber layers. The optimization of the layout shows that arrays of metallic nanowires placed on the front surface improve light harvesting in thin film devices but provide absorption enhancement only for TM polarized light in wafer based devices. The designed gratings have been fabricated with a process based on Laser Interference Lithography suitable to nanopattern large area substrates and able to control the duty cycle. Optical characterizations of the samples validate the modelling results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have successfully developed novel aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO-X) films with a high haze ratio by the combined use of an etched glass substrate and wet-etched AZO-X films. The effects of the use of an etched glass substrate and wet-chemical etching on the properties of AZO-X films were investigated. The texture size and rms roughness of these films largely increased with glass surface roughening. Post-treatment using wet chemical etching slightly increased the texture size and rms roughness. The etched glass approach has been found to be a promising method for achieving an AZO-coated glass substrate with a high haze ratio. Using high-haze ratio AZO-X films as the front transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers in solar cells, we improved the quantum efficiency (QE) of these solar cells particularly in the long-wavelength region. Thus, the AZO-X films deposited on etched glass have a high potential for use as front TCO layers in silicon-based thin-film solar cells. (C) 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB Due to the necessity of associating high-purity monocrystalline silicon and lower-cost multicrystalline silicon wafers, the monocrystalline-like silicon technique is used as a promising method for solar-cell fabrication. The grain orientation of this material is composed of both aOE (c) 111 > and aOE (c) 100 > orientations. As a result of a combination for properties on the basis of two types of materials, silicon surface texturing was carried out by using alkaline (NaOH) chemical and reactive ion etching (RIE) texturing. In this research, we investigated the optical and the electrical properties of silicon surfaces prepared by using different texturing processes. By using the alkaline and RIE texturing processes, we obtained a fill factor of 78.6% with a conversion efficiency of 17.2% for a monocrystalline-like silicon wafer with an active surface area of 243 cm(2). Compared to alkaline texturing, this conversion efficiency shows an increase of 0.5%. Thus, large-area monocrystalline-like silicon solar cells with high efficiency and low cost can be fabricated.

AB Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) films have promising applications in solar cells, radiometers, and photonic devices. We have fabricated VACNT films with thicknesses of 10, 36, 45, and 120 mu m on silicon substrates. The absorption coefficient of each film is obtained from the measured regular transmittance from 1 to 19 mu m wavelengths, using a ratio method. The degree of alignment of the VACNT films is estimated by comparison of experiments with an analysis based on the effective medium theory. The effect of thickness on the absorption coefficient of the VACNT films is elucidated according to their morphologies. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4757395]

AB Boron (B)- and antimony (Sb)-doped Si quantum dots (QDs) in Si3N4 films were fabricated using the co-sputtering method with a post-deposition anneal. The effect of B and Sb on Si QDs films was investigated in terms of structural, optical and electrical properties. It is found that a low dopant concentration induced negligible structural changes in the Si QD films. The PL intensity decreases with increasing B or Sb content. This could result from the non-radiative recombination processes attributed to defects associated with the dopants and Auger processes due to successful doping of Si QDs. For the B-doped sample the conductivity increases about 100 times, which could be attributed to an increase in carrier concentration. For the Sb-doped sample, a significant increase (six orders of magnitude) in conductivity suggests an effective Sb doping. The charge transport mechanism in the Sb-doped Si QD films matches well with the percolation-hopping model in low temperature region. Both B- and Sb-doped samples show thermally activated hopping conduction characteristics in the range of 220-320 K. (C) 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB Conductive nanowires (NWs) provide several advantages as a template and electrode material for solar cells due to their favorable light scattering properties. While the majority of NW solar cell architectures studied are based on semiconductor materials, metallic NWs could provide equivalent anti-reflection properties, while acting as a low-resistance back contact for charge transport, and facilitate light scattering in thin layers of semiconductors coated on the surface. However, fabrication of single-crystalline highly anti-reflective NWs on low-cost, flexible substrates remains a challenge to drive down the cost of NW solar cells. In this study, metallic NixSi NW arrays are fabricated by a simple, bottom-up, and low-cost method based on the thermal decomposition of silane on the surface of flexible Ni foil substrates without the need for lithography, etching or catalysts. The optical properties of these NW arrays demonstrate broadband suppression of reflection to levels below 1% from 350 nm to 1100 nm, which is among the highest values reported for NWs. A simple route to control the diameter and density of the NWs is introduced based on variations in a carrier gas flow rate. A high-resolution TEM, XRD and TEM-EDS study of the NWs reveals that they are single crystalline, with the phase and composition varying between Ni2Si and NiSi. The nanowire resistivity is measured to be 10-4 O-cm, suggesting their use as an efficient back electrode material for nanostructured solar cells with favorable light scattering properties.

AB Researchers have focused on the development of Si nano-or micro-structured solar cells (SCs) because of their enhanced optical absorption properties and their ability to decouple minority carrier diffusion and light absorption paths. We adopt a low-cost method to monolithically fabricate Si-micrograting SC (SiMG-SC) with vertical sidewall electrodes and a vertical multi-junction, which minimizes the reflection losses from conventional planar metallic electrodes and increases the minority carrier collection probability. We consequently intensified the photovoltaic properties, i.e., the current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency, by 11.2%, 23.7%, and 52.9%, respectively, compared to those of the control SCs.

AB Two different growth mechanisms are compared for the fabrication of Si/SiO2 nanostructures on crystalline silicon (c-Si) to be used as hetero-emitter in high-efficiency solar cells: (1) The decomposition of substoichiometric amorphous SiOx (a-SiOx) films with 0<x<1.3 and (2) the dewetting of thin amorphous silicon (a-Si) layers.
   The grown layers are investigated with regard to their structural properties, their passivation quality for c-Si wafer substrates and their electrical properties in order to evaluate their suitability as a nanodot hetero-emitter. While by layer decomposition, no passivating nanodots could be formed, the dewetting process allows fabricating nanodot passivation layers at temperatures as low as 600 degrees C. The series resistance through Ag/[Si-nanodots in SiO2]/c-Si/Al structures for dewetting is similar to nanostructured silicon rich SiOx films. Still, a nanodot hetero-emitter which exhibits both a satisfying passivation of the substrate and induces a high band bending by doping at the same time could not be fabricated yet.

AB The standard way to improve the light management of thin film solar cells is to introduce a light scattering structure, either on the front window or at the back reflector. Usually, growth conditions of TCO layers are adjusted to get random surface roughness on the front window. In this paper we present an alternative method, which can be applied both on the front window and at the back reflector. It involves imprinting a UV curable coating layer allowing full control on the texture (random or periodic) to fully optimise the light trapping. Light trapping is even more important for microcrystalline Si solar cells. We have fabricated thin film nip Si solar cells with sputtered Ag/ZnO back contacts on embossed barrier layers on steel foil. We show that the UV curable coating is well-suited as imprintable barrier layer between the steel foil and the active layers. For nip a-Si cells we can obtain light trapping, as measured by the short-circuit current, that is almost as good as that of nip a-Si cells made on Asahi U-type glass, covered with a Ag/ZnO back reflector. Furthermore, we show that dynamically processed a-Si nip cells on foil realised efficiencies of over 7%, which are only slightly less than for cells made in a UHV lab-scale cluster tool in static processing. Finally, a-Si/a-Si tandems and mu c-Si/a-Si tandems have been fabricated. Initial efficiencies of around 8% on textured barrier layer on steel foil have been achieved. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Silicon nanowire arrays fabricated by metal-assisted wet chemical etching have emerged as a promising architecture for solar energy harvesting applications. Here we investigate the dynamics and transport properties of photoexcited carriers in nanowires derived from an intrinsic silicon wafer using the terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy. Both the dynamics and the pump fluence dependence of the photoinduced complex conductivity spectra up to several THz were measured. The photoinduced conductivity spectra follow a Lorentz dependence, arising from surface plasmon resonances in nanowires. The carrier lifetime was observed to approach 0.7 ns, which is limited primarily by surface trapping. The intrinsic carrier mobility was found to be similar to 1000 cm(2)/(V.s). Compared to other silicon nanostructures, these relative high values observed for both the carrier lifetime and mobility are the consequences of high crystallinity and surface quality of the nanowires fabricated by the metal-assisted wet chemical etching method.

AB A blazed grating has been studied to improve light absorption in thin-film solar cells (TFSCs). The grating is a periodic arrangement of wedges made of aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) that also serves as the back spacer. The absorber layer of the photovoltaic (PV) device can be made of inorganic or organic semiconductor material. Here we study hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and nano-crystalline Si (nc-Si). Full wave, finite element simulations were performed to optimize the design for the highest short circuit current (J(sc)). The J(sc) of the optimized 1D grating design was 16.05 mA cm(-2) for TE polarization and 15.18 mA cm(-2) for TM polarization, with an effective a-Si:H layer thickness of only 277 nm. As compared to a planar cell with the same volume of a-Si:H, the enhancement of J(sc) by the 1D grating design was 27.6% for TE polarization and 20.7% for TM polarization. We extended this design to a 2D grating structure that was less sensitive to polarization as compared to the 1D grating design. With an equivalent a-Si:H layer thickness of 322 nm, the optimized design yielded a J(sc) of 17 : 16 mA cm(-2). The blazed grating surface can be fabricated using the glancing angle deposition method.

AB A novel and facile method was successfully developed to fabricate wafer-scale Si nanowire arrays with well-controlled sizes through the in-situ porous anodic alumina (PAA) template-assisted wet-etching process. The diameter and filling ratio (inter-wire spacing) of the as-prepared Si nanowires are determined by the size and density of pores in the in-situ PAA templates, which can be tailored independently by adjusting the anodization voltages and the immersion time of PAA templates in phosphoric acid. The length of Si nanowires can be more than one hundred micrometers long, which is controlled by adjusting the wet-etching time. Moreover, this method is compatible with complex Si surface topology for creating desirable 3-dimensional hybrid micro/nano-structures. Such Si nanowire arrays exhibit ultralow reflectance and interesting wettability that are of great importance to photovoltaics and thermal management applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The future exploitation of the exceptional properties of freestanding silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) in marketable applications relies upon our ability to produce large amounts of defect-free Si NCs by means of a low-cost method. Here, we demonstrate that Si NCs fabricated by scalable rf plasma-assisted decomposition of silane with additional hydrogen gas injected into the afterglow region of the plasma exhibit immediately after synthesis the lowest reported defect density, corresponding to a value of only about 0.002-0.005 defects per NC for Si NCs of 4 nm size. In addition, the virtually perfect hydrogen termination of these Si NCs yields an enhanced resistance against natural oxidation in comparison to Si NCs with nearly one order of magnitude larger initial defect density.

Following their synthesis, all NW networks are deposited through simple solution based methods. Photoresponse characteristics and transparency of the photodetectors for different Ge NW densities are measured. The fabricated devices show a large response with short relaxation times (< 10 ms), are flexible and transparent within the visible spectrum.

AB We report on the structural and optical properties of porous silicon nanowires (PSiNWs) fabricated using silver (Ag) ions assisted electroless etching method. Silicon nanocrystallites with sizes <5 nm embedded in amorphous silica have been observed from PSiNW samples etched using the optimum hydrofluoric acid (HF) concentration. The strongest photoluminescence (PL) signal has been measured from samples etched with 4.8 M of HF, beyond which a significant decreasing in PL emission intensity has been observed. A qualitative model is proposed for the formation of PSiNWs in the presence of Ag catalyst. This model affirms our observations in PL enhancement for samples etched using HF < 4.8 M and the eventual PL reduction for samples etched beyond 4.8 M of HF concentration. The enhancement in PL signals has been associated to the formation of PSiNWs and the quantum confinement effect in the Si nanocrystallites. Compared to PSiNWs without Si-O-x,, the HF treated samples exhibited significant blue PL peak shift of 100 nm. This effect has been correlated to the formation of defect states in the surface oxide. PSiNWs fabricated using the electroless etching method can find useful applications in optical sensors and as anti-reflection layer in silicon-based solar cells.

AB Carbon nanotube (CNT)/polymer composite materials have been widely studied for two decades. However, there remains a common and critical challenge, i.e., random dispersion of CNTs in polymer matrices, which has largely lowered their properties and limited their applications. Herein, we have developed a general method to prepare highly aligned CNT/polymer composite materials in formats of array, film, and fiber. The key procedure is to synthesize spinnable CNT arrays with high quality by a chemical vapor deposition process. Fe/Al2O3 was used as catalyst, ethylene was used as carbon source, a mixture gas of argon and hydrogen was used as carrying gas. The optimal growth conditions were summarized as below: thickness of 1.2 nm for Fe, thickness of 3 nm for Al2O3, flow rate of 400 standard cm(3)/min for argon, flow rate of 90 standard cm(3)/min for ethylene, flow rate of 30 standard cm(3)/min for hydrogen, growth temperature of 740 degrees C, and growth time of 10 min. Here the catalyst system was coated on silicon substrate by electron beam evaporation with rates of 0.5 and 2 angstrom/s for Fe and Al2O3, respectively. To prepare CNT sheets or fibers, the spinnable array was first stabilized in a stage. A blade was then used to draw a ribbon out of the array. A CNT sheet would be obtained if the ribbon was directly pulled out without rotation, while a fiber should be produced if a rotary spinning was used. The spinning speed was about 15 cm/min. Monomer/polymer solutions or melts were directly coated onto the aligned CNT sheet or fiber to produce the aligned CNT/polymer film or fiber. Due to the high alignment of CNTs in polymer matrices, the resulting composite materials exhibited remarkable physical properties, e.g., the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity can be improved for one and three orders compared with the conventional solution blending method, respectively. These novel composite materials are promising for a wide variety of applications. The use of them as novel counter electrodes to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells has been investigated as a demonstration. In a typical fabrication, an aligned CNT/polymer film (typical thickness of 5 mu m) was first transferred onto fluorine doped tin oxide as counter electrode. A layer of TiO2 was coated onto fluorine doped tin oxide as working electrode, followed by immersion into 0.5 mmol/L cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2'-bipyridy1-4,4'-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (also called N719) solution in a mixture solvent of acetonitrile/tert-butanol (volume ratio of 1/1) for 16 h. After being further rinsed with acetonitrile and dried, the N719-incorporated TiO2 electrode was assembled with the counter electrode. An electrolyte which consisted of Lil, I-2, 2-2-3-with propyl methyl 5-membered imidazole iodine, GuSCN, and tri-butyl-phosphate in dehydrated acetonitrile was injected into the cell through a hole on the counter electrode. The hole was finally sealed with surlyn and a piece of glass.

AB A new technique is developed to fabricate biomimetic antireflection coatings (ARCs). This technique combines a bottom-up fabrication approach (glancing angle deposition, or GLAD) with a top-down engineering process (ion milling). The GLAD technique is first utilized to produce nanopillar arrays (NPAs) with broadened structures, which are subsequently transformed into biomimetic tapered geometries by means of post-deposition ion milling. This structure transformation, due to milling-induced mass redistribution, remarkably decreases reflection over a wide wavelength range (300-1700 nm) and field of view (angle of incidence <60 degrees with respect to the substrate normal). The milling-induced antireflection enhancement has been demonstrated in the NPAs made of Si, SiOx and TiO2, illustrating that this integrated technique is readily adapted to a wide variety of materials. Good agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the enhanced antireflection performance is ascribed to a smoother refractive index transition from the substrate to the air, which improves the impedance match and reduces reflection losses. Additionally, ion bombardment tends to alter the stoichiometry and diminish the crystallographic structure of the NPA materials. The broadband and quasi-omnidirectional antireflection observed establishes the strong competitiveness of this technique with the methods previously reported.

AB We report the structural, electrical, and optical characteristics of Al-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films deposited on glass by atomic layer deposition (ALD) with various Al(2)O3 film contents for use as transparent electrodes. Unlike films fabricated by a sputtering method, the diffraction peak position of the films deposited by ALD progressively moved to a higher angle with increasing Al2O3 film content. This indicates that Zn sites were effectively replaced by Al, due to layer-by-layer growth mechanism of ALD process which is based on alternate self-limiting surface chemical reactions. By adjusting the Al2O3 film content, a ZnO:Al film with low electrical resistivity (9.84 x 10(-4) 0 Omega.cm) was obtained at an Al2O3 film content of 3.17%, where the Al concentration, carrier mobility, optical transmittance, and bandgap energy were 2.8 wt%, 11.20 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), 94.23%, and 3.6 eV, respectively. Moreover, the estimated figure of merit value of our best sample was 8.2 m Omega(-1). These results suggest that ZnO:Al films deposited by ALD could be useful for electronic devices in which especially require 3-dimensional conformal deposition of the transparent electrode and surface passivation.

AB Surface texturing is an effective method to reduce surface reflectance and improve the efficiency of silicon solar cell. In this paper, the "black silicon" antireflection coating is fabricated by using plasma immersion ion implantation. The surface morphology and reflectance are investigated by atomic force microscope and UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer, respectively. Results show that mountain-like structure with a depth of 0-550 nm is fabricated on black silicon surface. Both the fractional area occupied by silicon and refractive index decrease smoothly with the increase of depth across the antireflection coating. The weighted average reflectance of black silicon is as low as 6.0% in a wavelength range of 300-1000 nm. The depression mechanism of the optical reflectance is analyzed by simulating the structure with the transfer matrix method, and the simulation result fits the measured spectrum well.

AB This work reports the synthesis of nanospikes decorated ZnO sheets on the electrodeposited ZnO seeded fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates through the hydrothermal method at 90 degrees C and its application as photoanode for the efficient dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The unique nanospikes decorated ZnO sheets were comprised of nanospikes with the average diameter of similar to 80-100 nm and the sheets of several nanometers. The ZnO nanospikes were decorated on either one side or the both side of the single ZnO sheets (thickness similar to 50-60 nm). The X-rays diffraction and UV-Vis spectroscopy results revealed that the grown nanospikes decorated ZnO sheets exhibited well crystalline with typical wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO nanostructures. A growth mechanism was proposed to investigate the formation of the grown nanospikes decorated ZnO sheets. The photoanode showed the relatively high dye absorption which was derived from the larger surface area of the grown nanospikes decorated ZnO sheets. The solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of similar to 2.51% with the high short circuit current (J(SC)) of 6.07 mA/cm(2) was attained by DSSC fabricated with nanospikes decorated ZnO sheets photoanode. The enhanced performance might credit to the high charge collection and the fast electrons transfer at the interfaces of ZnO and the electrolyte layer due to the high dye absorption over the surface of ZnO leading to high light harvesting.

AB Hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells were fabricated using solution-based processes. All silicon layers of the p-i-n junction were stacked by a spin-cast method using doped and non-doped polydihydrosilane solutions. Further, a hydrogen-radical treatment under vacuum conditions was employed to reduce spin density in the silicon films. Following this treatment, the electric properties of the silicon films were improved, and the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells was also increased from 0.01% to 0.30%-0.51% under the AM-1.5G (100 mW/cm(2)) illumination conditions.

AB Wafer segmentation is investigated as a method to introduce flexibility to crystalline photovoltaics. A proof-of-concept flexible device was fabricated from an InP/InGaAsP multiple-quantum-well solar cell by integrating the device wafer with a polymer substrate via an electrically-conductive adhesive and subsequently fracturing the wafer along parallel cleavage planes. The effects of segmentation on leakage current and power conversion efficiency are investigated in the dark and under solar illumination, respectively.

AB Amorphous carbon (a-C) solar cells were successfully prepared using a novel and self-designed aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method using camphor oil as a precursor. The fabricated solar cell with the configuration of Au/p-C/n-Si/Au achieved an efficiency of 0.008% with a fill factor of 0.15 for the device deposited at 0.5 h. The current-voltage (I-V) graph emphasized on the linear graph (ohmic) for the a-C thin films, whereas for the p-n device structure, a rectifying curve was obtained. The rectifying curves signify the heterojunction between the p-type a-C film and the n-Si substrate and designate the generation of electron-hole pair of the samples under illumination. Photoresponse characteristics of the deposited a-C was highlighted when being illuminated (AM 1.5 illumination: 100 mW/cm(2), 25 degrees C). Transmittance spectrum exhibit a large transmittance value (> 85%) and absorption coefficient value of 10(3)-10(4) cm(-1) at the visible range of 390 to 790 nm. The atomization of a liquid precursor solution into fine sub-micrometre-sized aerosol droplets in AACVD induced the smooth surface of a-C films. To the best of our knowledge, fabrication of a-C solar cell using this AACVD method has not yet been reported. (C) 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

The hybrid module consisted of the thin-film thermoelectric module, a photovoltaic module, a hot mirror, and a near-infrared (NIR) focusing lens. NIR light, which does not contribute to photovoltaic conversion, was separated from solar light using the hot mirror. When the NIR light was focused onto the hot side of the thermoelectric module by the lens, the open voltage generated by the thin-film thermoelectric generator was 78 mV. The total open voltage of the thermal-photovoltaic hybrid generator increased by 1.3% compared to that of the photovoltaic module alone. (C) 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB Formation of a well-passivated boron emitter for mass production of low-cost and high-efficiency n-type silicon solar cells is a major challenge in the photovoltaic industry. In this letter, we report on a novel and commercially viable method, inkjet printing, to create boron emitters. Phosphorus diffusion was used on the rear to form a back-surface field in conjunction with chemically grown oxide/silicon nitride (SiNx) stack on the front and back for surface passivation. Finally, front and back screen-printed contacts were formed through the dielectric stacks to fabricate large-area (239 cm(2)) n-type cells. This technology resulted in 19.0%-efficient p(+)-n-n(+) cells with a V-oc of 644 mV, a J(sc) of 38.6 mA/cm(2), and a fill factor of 76.3%. This demonstrates for the first time the promise of boron-inkjet-printing technology for low-cost and high-performance n-type Si cells.

ID TEXTURIZATION
AB Optical losses by reflection and transmission of the incident light should be reduced to improve the efficiency of solar cells. Compared with antireflection coatings, surface texturing is a more persistent and effective solution aiming at reducing light reflection losses. Alkali (NaOH, KOH) or acidic (HF, HNO3, CH3COOH) chemicals are used in conventional solar cell production lines for wet chemical texturing. However, Surface texturing is too difficult to apply to solar cell fabrication with thinner wafers due to the large amount of silicon loss caused by saw damage removal (SDR) and the texturing process for multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si). In order to solve the problems, reactive ion etching (RIE) has been applied for surface texturing of solar cell wafers. The RIE method can be effective in the reducing surface reflection with low silicon loss. In this study, we, therefore, fabricated a large-area (243.3 cm(2)) mc-Si solar cell by maskless surface texturing using a SF6/O-2 RIE process. Also, we achieved a conversion efficiency (Eff), open circuit voltage (V-oc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) as high as 17.2%, 616 mV, 35.1 mA/cm(2), and 79.6%, respectively, which are suitable for fabricating thin crystalline silicon solar cells at low cost and with high efficiency.
