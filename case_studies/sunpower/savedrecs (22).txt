AB A deposition method, in which similar to 3 nm-thick deposition and hydrogen plasma annealing are alternately repeated, has been employed to fabricate hydrogenated amorphous silicon-germanium (a-Si1-3Gex:H) alloys by changing substrate temperatures from 150 to 230 degrees C. The germanium content, x, remains unchanged at about 0.42 independent of the substrate temperature for a molar fraction of SiH4/GeH4=10. The bonded hydrogen concentration decreases with increasing substrate temperature, resulting in a decrease in the optical bandgap from 1.52 to 1.43eV. It is found that a photoconductivity of 4.5 X 10(-5) S/cm and a photosensitivity, 9.1 X 10(4), under AM 1 (100 mW/cm(2)) illumination are obtained at a substrate temperature of 175 degrees C at an optical bandgap of 1.49 eV.

AB We used a 10-kW, high-flux solar furnace (HFSF) to diffuse the front-surface n(+)-p junction and the back-surface p-p(+) junction of single-crystal silicon solar cells in one processing step. We found that all of these HFSF-processed cells have better conversion efficiencies than control cells of identical structures fabricated by conventional furnace diffusion methods. We also used the HFSF to crystallize a-Si:H thin films on glass, to texture crystalline silicon surfaces, to deposit gold contacts on silicon wafers, and to getter impurities from metallurgical grade silicon. HFSF processing offers several advantages over conventional furnace processing: (1) it provides a cold-wall process, which reduces contamination; (2) temperature versus time profiles can be precisely controlled; (3) wavelength, intensity, and spatial distribution of the incident solar flux can be controlled and changed rapidly; (4) a number of high-temperature processing steps can be performed simultaneously; and (5) combined quantum and thermal effects may benefit overall cell performance. We conclude that HFSF processing of silicon solar cells has the potential to improve cell efficiency, reduce cell fabrication costs, and also be an environmentally friendly manufacturing method. We have also demonstrated that the HFSF can be used to achieve solid-phase crystallization of a-Si:H at very high speed.

This film was obtained by using a new nucleation layer with 1000 Angstrom wide single-crystalline grains embedded in a matrix of amorphous tissue. A poly-Si thin-film solar cell fabricated using this film as an active layer demonstrated a total area conversion efficiency of 9.2% (active area efficiency: 9.7%), which is the world's highest value for crystalline silicon solar cells fabricated below 600 degrees C on metal substrates.

AB The fabrication of hydrogen-diluted amorphous silicon (a-Si) him by the mercury-sensitized photochemical vapor deposition (photo-CVD) method has been performed. The hydrogen content in the film along with the optical bandgap was found to increase with the hydrogen/silane dilution ratio, while the dihyidride/monohydride bond ratio decreased at the substrate temperature of 150 degrees C. As a result, a decrease in the defect density was observed. Moreover, the photo- and dark conductivities were maintained in the range of 3 x 10(-5) and 1 x 10(-10) S/cm, respectively, in spite of the fact that the optical bandgap widened. The solar cells with hydrogen diluted i-layers were fabricated and showed improvement in the open-circuit voltage and fill factor (FF), resulting in the increase of both initial and stabilized efficiencies. The forward- and reverse-bias dark I-V characteristics measurement of solar cells revealed improvement in quality and stability of the hydrogen-diluted i-layers.

AB Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film has been prepared by a solid phase crystallization (SPC) method as a low-cost photovoltaic material.  To grow the thin-film poly-Si, two steps of technologies were applied.  One was deposition of an a-Si film that is suited to solid phase crystallization, and the other was adoption of a textured substrate to that film.  It has been observed from the results that the average grain size of poly-Si grown by the SPC process increases with increases in the TA/TO value (peak height ratio of TA peak and TO peak) in Raman spectra of a-Si films before the SPC process.  Thin-film poly-Si grown on a textured substrate has larger grain size and, consequently, seven times higher mobility than that on a flat substrate.  By applying a-Si films with a large TA/TO value to textured substrates, an n-type poly-Si with a grain size of 6 mum was fabricated, and this film has a Hall mobility of 623 cm2/Vs (carrier density:  3.0 x 10(15) cm-3).  Thin-film solar cells (thickness:  10 mum) using poly-Si prepared by the SPC method have been developed, for the first time.  Among crystalline solar cells processed at temperatures below 600-degrees-C, the world's highest conversion efficiency of 8.5% has been achieved with a size of 1 cm2.

AB The performance of a p-i buffer layer in pin amorphous silicon solar cell was improved by the ''alternately repeating deposition and hydrogen plasma treatment method (ADHT)''. The optical bandgap of the a-Si film was increased by hydrogen plasma treatment. The wide optical bandgap and the high photoconductive a-Si:H films without carbon could be fabricated by the ADHT method. The conversion efficiency of the solar cell with a-Si:H buffer layer was almost the same as that using an a-SiC:H buffer layer. Second, the a-Si (ADHT) films were applied to the n-i buffer layer. The insertion of a-Si (ADHT) films between the i-layer and the n-layer was effective to improve the cell performance, especially the fill factor. With the use of high performance a-Si p-i and n-i buffer layer deposited by ADHT method, a cell conversion efficiency of 12.9% was obtained.

ID LIFETIME
AB A comparative study of the measurements of the minority carrier diffusion length L in the base region of n+-p-p+ silicon solar cells by the LWSR, the MWSR, and the JSK methods, all of which exploit the photoresponse of cell in one way or the other, has been made. The LWSR and the MWSR methods utilize the long wavelength (e.g., 0.90 < lambda < 1.05 mum) spectral response and middle wavelength (e.g., 0.75 < lambda < 0.90 mum) spectral response, respectively, when the cell is illuminated from the n+-front side. However, the JSK method utilizes the rate of increase of short-circuit current density of the cell with the intensity of a single suitable middle or long wavelength radiation when the cell is illuminated from the p+-back side. Among these, the MWSR method and the JSK method each require the surface recombination velocity Sb of the minority carriers at the p+-back end of the p-base region to be known. We fabricated a few n+-p-p+ structure based bifacial silicon solar cells from 250 mum and 420 mum thick CZ silicon wafers and carried out measurements of L for them. The JSK method was applicable to both the thin and thick cells and gave accurate values of L. For thick cells the LWSR method was found to be more accurate than the MWSR method, the error in the value of L being, < 4% for the former and < 6% for the latter when compared with the JSK method. On the other hand, for thin cells, the LWSR method was found to be highly erroneous; the errors being 17-31% for the LWSR method in comparison with an error of 4% for the MWSR method. The results further showed that, generally, for thin front illuminated n+-p-p+ cells having a shallow n+-p front junction, L sufficiently large and d/L < 2.5, the MWSR method would give more accurate value of L than the LWSR method.

AB Indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/silicon oxide/mat-textured n-Si junction solar cells having an energy conversion efficiency of 15% are fabricated by the spray pyrolysis method. Their characteristics and the junction properties are compared with the same junction solar cells having a flat Si surface. In cases where the ITO film is deposited on a hydrofluoric acid-etched mat-textured Si surface, the open circuit photovoltage (V(OC)) is low (405 mV). Scanning electron microscopy observation shows that high-density dislocations are formed near the Si surface, and the temperature dependence of the current-voltage characteristics suggests that the trap-assisted multistep tunneling through the Si depletion layer is a dominant current flow mechanism. In cases where the ITO film is deposited on a thermal silicon oxide-covered mat-textured Si surface, the formation of the dislocations is suppressed, and consequently V(OC) is increased to 485 mV. For this solar cell, a surface recombination current takes the dominant part of the dark current in the bias region below approximately 250 mV, and a thermionic-assisted tunneling current is dominant in the higher bias region. For a cell where the thermal silicon oxide-covered mat-textured Si surface is annealed at 800-degrees-C under nitrogen before the deposition of the ITO film, V(OC) is further increased to 540 mV, and the energy conversion efficiency of 15% is achieved. In this case, the thermionic-assisted tunneling current density is decreased by an increase in the barrier height due probably to a reduction in the density of the positive charge in the silicon oxide layer. The surface recombination current density is also reduced by the removal of interface states, leading to the improvement of the fill factor.

AB Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin films prepared by the solid phase crystallization (SPC) method were investigated for application as photovoltaic materials. To improve the properties of the poly-Si thin film, two methods were developed to control crystallization. One is the partial doping method, in which starting material of a-Si consists of a doped layer and an undoped layer. We have succeeded in controlling nuclei generation using partial doping, and high mobility of 196 cm2/V.s was obtained at a carrier concentration of 1 x 10(18) cm-3. SPC temperature can also be decreased to 500-degrees-C. The other is adoption, for the first time, of a textured substrate which exerted effects on the enlargement of grain size in poly-Si thin films prepared by the SPC method. By combining the partial doping method with the textured substrate, an n-type poly-Si thin-film with the grain size of 6 mum was fabricated which showed the Hall mobility of 623 cm2/V.s (n: 3.0 x 10(15) cm-3). In a solar cell (thickness: 12 mum) applying this film, a conversion efficiency of 6.2% was obtained and a collection efficiency of 50% was achieved at a wavelength of 900 nm.

AB ZnO films prepared by the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method were applied to amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cells as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO). The B2H6 flow rate and the thickness of the film were optimized at 0.5 mumol/min and 2.0 mum, respectively. We also proposed a preannealing technique of the ZnO film before fabrication of a-Si solar cells, and it was shown that the open circuit voltage was increased with use of this technique. Furthermore, we fabricated a novel p-i-n a-Si solar cell structure, which had a 0.1-mum-thick ZnO layer between a-Si and the metal electrode. Theoretical calculation and experimental results proved that the reflectance of the ZnO/Ag back reflector was higher than that of the Ag electrode at wavelengths between 600 nm and 800 nm. As a result, a marked enhancement of collection efficiencies in the long-wavelength region was achieved, resulting in the increase of the short-circuit current of about 1 mA/cm2. Using both the preannealing technique of ZnO film and a ZnO/Ag/Al back reflector, a conversion efficiency of 11.9% (V(oc)=0.893 V, I(sc) =18.6 mA/cm2, FF=0.715) was obtained.

AB Formation of thin insulating SiO2 films by anodic oxidation of silicon was studied as a part of investigating an alternative method of fabricating low-cost silicon MIS solar cells. Anodization in the constant-voltage mode was carried out in nonaqueous ethylene glycol solution. The film thickness was carefully measured using an ellipsometer of wavelength 6238 angstrom. MIS cell performance was evaluated by comparing the open circuit voltage V(oc) and the short circuit current density I(sc) with those of the bare Schottky cell (without anodization) under illumination by a tungsten lamp. It was found that anodization in the constant-voltage mode can increase V(oc) without reducing I(sc), and that anodization in the constant-voltage mode is more controllable and reproducible. The optimum formation voltage which gives the maximum V(oc) of the MIS cell depends on the forming voltage of oxide. A brief discussion on the mechanism for V(oc) increase is given.

TI INFLUENCE OF ITO DEPOSITION TECHNOLOGY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SIS

LA English
DT Article
ID SILICON
AB The behavior of ITO-SiO2-Si (p- or n-type) solar cells, fabricated using a reactive d.c. magnetron sputtering technique is investigated.  Using a numerical simulation model, it is shown that the presence of interface states introduced during the deposition procedure can explain the photovoltaic performance of both cell types.  The reactive d.c. magnetron sputtering deposition method proves to be unsuitable for fabricating efficient solar cells on both n- and p-type substrates, the observed efficiencies being 4 and 0.2%, respectively.  The influence on the cells properties of the RF substrate biasing and the d.c.-power applied to the target is also investigated.

AB A novel method for depositing Si(x)Cl1-x alloys on silicon, based on the silane and 1,1,1-trichloroethane gas system, has been investigated in an inexpensive hot-wall horizontal LPCVD reactor.  Temperatures in the range of 650 to 800-degrees-C and in-situ doping using arsine were used successfully.  The film characteristics were evaluated using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA)(XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and optical absorption.  N+-P+ heterojunctions with low reverse leakage current and a forward-bias ideality factor of 1.55 were successfully fabricated.

AB Hydrogenated amorphous silicon and related alloys represent a special type of thin film semiconductor material that has attracted much attention in the last decade.  The scientific and technological properties of these materials include a continuously adjustable band gap, reasonable carrier lifetime and drift length, efficient optical transitions, and the possibility of their n- or p-type doping during the deposition process.  The films can be easily fabricated with low costs by different chemical and physical vapour deposition methods which will be reported in some detail in this review.  The importance of defect passivation and its influence on the density of states will be discussed together with the dependence of the material properties on preparation techniques and conditions.  The second part of the review covers applications in devices and limitations due to the creation of metastable defects in these materials, the so-called Staebler-Wronski effect.  A short overview will be given about the principle, structures and function, advantages and state of development of the main applications such as solar cells, thin film (field effect) transistors, electrophotography devices, image sensors, memory switches, and light-emitting devices.
