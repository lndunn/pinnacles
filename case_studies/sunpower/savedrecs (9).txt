AB The p-n homojunctions are essential components for high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. However, the lack of p-type doping in CdS nanostructures hampers the fabrication of efficient photovoltaic (PV) devices from homojunctions. Here we report a facile solution-processed method to achieve efficient p-type doping in CdS nanoribbons (NRs) via a surface charge transfer mechanism by using spin-coated MoO3 nanodots (NDs). The NDs-decorated CdS NRs exhibited a hole concentration as high as 8.5 x 10(19) cm(-3), with the p-type conductivity tunable in a wide range of 7 orders of magnitude. The surface charge transfer mechanism was characterized in detail by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and first-principle calculations. CdS NR-homojunction PV devices fabricated on a flexible substrate exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 5.48%, which was significantly better than most of the CdS nanostructure-based heterojunction devices, presumably due to minimal junction defects. Devices made by connecting cells in series or in parallel exhibited enhanced power output, demonstrating the promising potential of the homojunction PV devices for device integration. Given the high efficiency of the surface charge transfer doping and the solution-processing capability of the method, our work opens up unique opportunities for high-performance, low-cost optoelectronic devices based on CdS homojunctions.

AB Surface texturing techniques of crystalline silicon (Si) wafers are an effective and permanent method for increases in the conversion efficiency of solar cells by reducing reflection losses and improving light trapping effects compared to antireflection coatings such as hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx:H) thin films. In this study, monocrystalline-like Si surfaces were textured by acidic solutions followed by reactive ion etching (RIE). Also, we investigated the optical and electrical properties of Si surfaces prepared by different texturing processes. By using the acidic and RIE texturing processes for monocrystalline-like Si surfaces, we achieved open circuit voltage (V-oc), short circuit current density (J(sc)), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency as high as 633 mV, 36.7 mA/cm(2), 77.5% and 18%, respectively, in a solar cell with an active surface area of 156 x 156 mm(2) (243 cm(2)). Compared to the conventional acidic texturing, the acidic and RIE texturing of front Si surfaces improved the solar cell conversion efficiency of 0.9%. Therefore, the results indicate that large-area monocrystalline-like Si solar cells with high efficiency can be fabricated by standard wet chemical and additional RIE texturing processes.

AB Periodic silicon nanocones (SiNCs) with different periodicities are fabricated by dry etching of a Si substrate patterned using monolayer polystyrene (PS) nanospheres as a mask. Hybrid Si/PEDOT:PSS solar cells based on the SiNCs are then fabricated and characterized in terms of their optical, electrical, and photovoltaic properties. The optical properties of the SiNCs are also investigated using theoretical simulation based on the finite element method. The SiNCs reveal excellent light trapping ability as compared to a planar Si substrate. It is found that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the hybrid cells decreases with increasing periodicity of the SiNCs. The highest PCE of 7.1% is achieved for the SiNC hybrid cell with a 400-nm periodicity, due to the strong light trapping near the peak of the solar spectrum and better current collection efficiency.

AB Integrating nanostructures onto optical fibers presents a promising strategy for developing new-fashioned devices and extending the scope of nanodevices' applications. Here we report the first fabrication of a composite silicon nanostructure on an optical fiber. Through direct chemical etching using an H2O2/HF solution, multicrystal silicon films with columnar microstructures are etched into a vertically aligned, inverted-cone-like nanorod array embedded in a nanocone array. A faster dissolution rate of the silicon at the void-rich boundary regions between the columns is found to be responsible for the separation of the columns, and thus the formation of the nanostructure array. The morphology of the nanorods primarily depends on the microstructure of the columns in the film. Through controlling the microstructure of the as-grown film and the etching parameters, the structural control of the nanostructure is promising. This fabrication method can be extended to a larger length scale, and it even allows roll-to-roll processing.

AB In this letter, we investigated spectral and opto-electronic conversion properties of the inorganic/organic hybrid cells by using silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)/Si nanoholes (SiNHs) nanocomposite films, which were fabricated by the modified metal-assisted electroless etching (EE) method. It was found that the optical absorption spectra of the films with AgNPs demonstrate a clear peak and show the enhancement of total absorption at the short wavelength. The results of current-voltage (I-V) measurements show that solar cells with AgNPs exhibit an increase of the power conversion efficiency by a factor of 2-3, in comparison with those of the samples without AgNPs. Moreover, higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) values in AgNPs-decorated solar cells were confirmed in the short-wavelength spectral region (400-700 nm), which were essential to achieve high-performance photovoltaic cells. We thought these were mainly attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects and increased light scattering of AgNPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a method to fabricate well-controlled periodic silicon nanopillars (Si NPs) in hexagonal arrays using silica nanosphere (SNS) lithography (SNL) combined with metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE). The period of the Si NPs is easily changed by using our silica nanosphere (SNS) spin-coating process, which provides excellent monolayer uniformity and coverage (>95%) over large surface areas. The size of the deposited SNS is adjusted by reactive ion etching (RIE) to produce a target diameter at a fixed period for control of the surface pattern size after a gold metal mask layer deposition. The Si NPs are etched with the MaCE technique following introduction of a Ni interfacial layer between the Si and Au catalyst layer for adhesion and improved lithographical accuracy. The result is a fast, convenient, and large-area applicable Si surface nanolithography technique for accurate and reproducible Si NP fabrication.

AB Light-trapping structures are fabricated on crystalline (100) silicon (c-Si) surfaces by picosecond (ps) laser irradiation followed by chemical etching. First, 1064-nm ps laser scanning is used to form micropore arrays on c-Si. The ps laser processing causes little reconsolidation of the silicon surface, which is beneficial to achieve precise etching. Control of the laser scanning interval, number of scans, and etching time gives a micro-nano hierarchical structure. In this hierarchical structure, the average diameter of the micropores is 25 to 30 mu m, while the size of the finer nanostructures on the micropore inner walls ranges from dozens to hundreds of nanometers. Unlike traditional laser texturing techniques, the whole laser process is carried out without mask and photolithography. The reflectance of the c-Si surface with a micro-nano hierarchical structure is as low as 6% in the wavelength range from 400 to 1000 nm without coating. Moreover, the samples also show good hydrophobicity. This is a potential method to fabricate economical antireflective structures that are ideal for applications in c-Si solar cells and self-cleaning c-Si microelectronic devices.

AB Several important semiconductor devices such as solar cells and photodetectors may be fabricated based on surface inversion layer junctions induced by fixed charge in a dielectric layer. Inversion layer junctions can easily be fabricated by depositing layers with a high density of fixed charge on a semiconducting substrate. Increasing the fixed charge improves such devices; for instance, the efficiency of a solar cell can be substantially increased by reducing the surface recombination velocity, which is a function of the fixed charge density. Methods for increasing the charge density are therefore of interest. In this work, the fixed charge density in silicon nitride layers deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition is increased to very high values above 1 x 10(13) cm(-2) after the application of an external voltage to a gate electrode. The effect of the fixed charge density on the surface recombination velocity was experimentally observed using the combination of capacitance-voltage characterization and photoluminescence imaging, showing a significant reduction in the surface recombination velocity for increasing charge density. The surface recombination velocity vs. charge density data was analyzed using a numerical device model, which indicated the presence of a sub-surface damage region formed during deposition of the layers. Finally, we have demonstrated that the aluminum electrodes used for charge injection may be chemically removed in phosphoric acid without loss of the underlying charge. The injected charge was shown to be stable for a prolonged time period, leading us to propose charge injection in silicon nitride films by application of soaking voltage as a viable method for fabricating inversion layer devices.

AB Transmittance and conductivity are the key requirements for transparent electrodes. Many optoelectronic applications require additional features such as mechanical flexibility and cost-efficient fabrication at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate a simple method to fabricate high performance transparent electrodes that is based on perforation of thin silver layers using picosecond laser pulses. Transparent electrodes have been characterized optically and electrically in order to determine the influence of specific surface coverage. Special attention was paid to maintaining sufficient conductivity in the metal-free areas. As a result, transmittance of a much higher bandwidth was achieved as compared to unpatterned metal films. Transparent electrodes have been fabricated on glass and plastic foil, as well as wafer-based silicon heterojunction solar cells, demonstrating their applicability for most relevant cases.

AB Highly conductive, transparent and flexible planar electrodes were fabricated using interwoven silver nanowires and single-walled carbon nanotubes (AgNW:SWCNT) in a PEDOT:PSS matrix via an epoxy transfer method from a silicon template. The planar electrodes achieved a sheet resistance of 6.6 +/- 0.0 Omega/square and an average transmission of 86% between 400 and 800 nm. A high figure of merit of 367 Omega(-1) is reported for the electrodes, which is much higher than that measured for indium tin oxide and reported for other AgNW composites. The AgNW: SWCNT: PEDOT: PSS electrode was used to fabricate low temperature (annealing free) devices demonstrating their potential to function with a range of organic semiconducting polymer: fullerene bulk heterojunction blend systems.

AB For a number of p (+)-n structures fabricated from single-crystal silicon by different technologies, the positions of the maximum derivatives of the room-temperature electroluminescence spectra are determined. With good accuracy, the positions of these maxima correspond to the fundamental absorption edge of silicon for absorption at TO-phonon-assisted transitions with the formation of free excitons. In addition to previously reported data, the results of the study prove the high efficiency of the differential method for analyzing the luminescence spectra of semiconductors.

AB Luminescent down shifting (LDS) is a viable way for improving the short-wavelength response of many photovoltaic technologies, such as cadmium telluride, copper-indium-gallium-(di)selenide and multi-crystalline silicon solar cells. In this work, we compare the experimental performance of LDS layers fabricated with six organic dyesboth alone and in mixturesand two polymers with the theoretical predictions obtained by three different approaches: ray-tracing simulations and two novel theoretical models. The first model is an analytical description of the LDS process and can reproduce the external quantum efficiency of the solar cell with LDS. The second one is based on a collection of figures of merit that address a desired property of the LDS. The three methods show an excellent agreement with the experimental results in the predicted variation of the short-circuit current (to within 0.5% in most cases) and help to understand the key factors that influence the performance of LDS, such as the optical coupling, surface roughness and scattering or edge losses. This agreement, regardless of the materials used for LDS and the underlying PV technology, not only supports the validity of the models but also suggests this theoretical formalism as a tool for designing optimised LDS layers in the future.

AB The purpose is to study the preparation of p type polyaniline (PANI) nanowire array and the fabrication of high performance UV photodetector with p-n junction based on p type polyaniline nanowire array and n type silicon. High-density polyaniline nanowire array was fabricated by using a layer of manganese dioxide as seed layer which was prepared by spin-coating method on the silicon substrate. The influence of different conditions on the morphology of polyaniline was discussed, and the growth mechanism of polyaniline nanowire array was revealed. It was found that polyaniline nanoparticles were priorly generated on the manganese dioxide seed layer with the oxidation of manganese dioxide seed layer to aniline in solution. The polyaniline nanoparticles grew vertically when another oxidant of ammonium persulfate (APS) was added into the solution, and high-density p type polyaniline nanowire array was obtained. Furthermore, high performance UV photodetector was fabricated with fast photoresponse, short recovery time and good stability based on the p-n junction of p type polyaniline nanowire array and n type silicon. When the bias voltage was 0 V, photocurrent was 9. 2 x 10(-8) A. And the intensity of photocurrent increased greatly when the bias voltage was improved. When the bias voltage arrived at 5 V, the photocurrent was improved to 3. 2 x 10(-5) A which was 1000 times higher than that with 0 V bias voltage.

AB A novel approach for fabricating ultrahigh-density sub-10 nm TiO2 nanosheet arrays with high aspect ratios by incorporating the spacer-defined double-patterning process with nanoline templates via atom layer deposition (ALD) was demonstrated. A nanoline template can be fabricated readily by pattern transfer from a thin silicon-containing block copolymer film into a thick crosslinked organic polymer layer. The excellent thermal stability of the crosslinked organic template allowed the high-temperature ALD process to deposit the TiO2 thin film conformally on the nanoline template. After the template was removed using dry etching and calcination, a highly crystalline anatase TiO2 nanosheet array with a length of several micrometers was obtained. The thickness of the resulting TiO2 nanosheet could be controlled below half the space of the originally defined nanoline template by incorporating the spacer-defined double-patterning process using ALD. This facile and scalable method could be a useful technique for fabricating ultrahigh-density arrays of various inorganic nanosheets with high aspect ratios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We suggested the possibility to suppress dislocation generation by controlling the microstructure of dendrite crystals in practical size Si wafers grown by the floating cast method. With the floating cast method, the contact angle between adjacent dendrite crystals can be used as a structural parameter to define grain boundaries (GBs). We fabricated a practical size silicon ingot fully covered with dendrite crystals and investigated dislocation density near the GBs as a function of the contact angle. The dislocation density was found to decrease with decreasing contact angle. This result can be explained by differences in shear stress on {111} slip surface around the GBs, as supported by numerical calculations considering various structural parameters in multicrystalline Si. These results confirm our previous results with laboratory-scale ingots, and we believe this concept can be applied to commercial growth processes. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB To explore the similarities and differences of hydrogen generation performance of silicon nanowires array (SiNWs array) photocathode prepared by different methods, we adopted two-step metal-catalyzed electroless etching method (TMCEE), one-step metal-catalyzed electroless etching method (OMCEE) and anodic oxidation etching method (AOE) to fabricate silicon nanowires array as a photocathode material for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation. Comparing with morphology, crystalline, anti-reflection characterization by FESEM, XRD and UV-Vis-IR DRS means, SiNWs array by TMCEE maintained better crystal structure and less surface defects than the samples prepared by the other two methods. Photoelectrochemical tests showed that the performance of SiNWs array by TMCEE was optimal. The photocurrent density value of SiNWs array by TMCEE was 4 times than the one by OMCEE, and 40 times than the one by AOE. The charge transfer resistance of SiNWs array by TMCEE was only 1/3 of SiNWs array by OMCEE, and 1/1 000 of SiNWs array by AOE.

AB Nanoporous anodic alumina (NPAA) films are fabricated on silicon (Si) surfaces by the anodization of aluminum (Al). Effect of the thickness of initial Al films on the antireflective characteristics of NPAA films consisting of random pore structures is investigated in the wavelength range of 300-1,100 nm at incident light angles (theta(inc)) of 3 degrees-70 degrees, together with theoretical analysis using a rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. The reflectance strongly depends on the thickness and porosity of NPAA films, resulting from anodization parameters such as applied voltage, anodization time, and pore widening time. For the obtained NPAA film at the initial Al thickness of 100 nm and the applied voltage of 30 V, the surface reflectance is reduced over a wide wavelength region of 300-1,100 nm at normal incidence of similar to 3 degrees, exhibiting the relatively lower average reflectance (R-avg) of similar to 19 % (i.e., R-avg similar to 39 % for the bare Si substrate). The lower angle-dependent reflective properties are observed compared to the bare Si substrate at theta(inc) = 20 degrees-70 degrees for unpolarized light. The calculated reflectance results of NPAA films show similar trends to the measured data.

AB Low bandgap Si(1-x)Ge(x) solar cells are designed, fabricated, characterized and analyzed for the purpose of acting as the bottom cell in a GaAsP-SiGe tandem solar cell. The development of the SiGe cell under a GaAsP cell can lead to a 34% relative increase in efficiency over that of a silicon solar cell. This work focuses on making a SiGe bottom cell that can generate 21 mA/cm(2) of short circuit current (J(sc)) at 1 Sun from photons beyond 780 nm and with a 450 mV band gap-voltage offset (W-oc) under 20 Suns illumination. Numerical and analytical methods are introduced to demonstrate the SiGe solar cells' performance limits and to examine the trade-offs among I-V performance, cell structure and material composition. Material compositions are confirmed with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electrochemical capacitance voltage profiling (ECV). First principles analysis shows that a Si.15Ge.85 cell with a 5 mu m base can produce the expected current and an efficiency of 8.8% under 20 Suns. By increasing base doping, we achieve a W-oc of 435 mV under 20 Suns with a Si.18Ge.82 cell. The best 1 Sun short circuit current measured from a Si.12Ge.88 cell at wavelengths beyond 780 nm without antireflection coating, back surface reflector, or back texturing is 12.9 mA/cm(2). Adding a back surface field to the structure will lead to a higher V-oc and lower W-oc. Implementing light trapping with a higher base angle of pyramids can lead to the target J(sc) of 21 mA/cm(2).

AB An efficient approach for enhancing the surface antireflection is proposed, in which a black silicon is fabricated by a femtosecond laser in alkaline solution. In the experiment, 2 wt% NaOH solution is formulated at room temperature (22 +/- A 1 A degrees C). Then, a polished silicon is scanned via femtosecond laser irradiation in 2 wt% NaOH solution. Jungle-like microstructures on the black silicon surface are characterized using an atomic force microscopy. The reflectance of the black silicon is measured at the wavelengths ranging from 400 to 750 nm. Compared to the polished silicon, the black silicon can significantly suppress the optical reflection throughout the visible region (< 5 %). Meanwhile, we also investigated the factors of the black silicon, including the femtosecond laser pulse energy and the scanning speed. This method is simple and effective to acquire the black silicon, which probably has a large advantage in fast and cost-effective black silicon fabrication.

AB We fabricated amorphous silicon (a-Si)-based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) consisting of alternating dense/porous films (i.e., pair) for a center wavelength (lambda(c)) of 0.96 mu m by oblique angle deposition (OAD) technique using an electron-beam evaporation system. The dense (high refractive index, i.e., high-n) and porous (low-n) a-Si films were deposited at two incident vapor flux angles of 0 degrees and 80 degrees in the OAD, respectively. Their optical reflectance characteristics were investigated in the wavelength range of 0.6-1.5 mu m, including theoretical comparison using a rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. Above three pairs, the reflectivity (R) of a-Si DBRs was almost saturated at wavelengths around 0.96 mu m, exhibiting R values of >97%. For the a-Si DBR with only three pairs, a broad normalized stop bandwidth (Delta lambda/lambda(c)) of similar to 22.5% was obtained at wavelengths of similar to 0.87-1.085 mu m, keeping high R values of >95%. To simply demonstrate the feasibility of device applications, the a-Si DBR with three pairs was coated as a high-reflection layer at the rear facet of GaAs/InGaAs quantum-well laser diodes (LDs) operating at lambda = 0.96 mu m. For the LDs coated with three-pair a-Si DBR, external differential quantum efficiency (eta(d)) was nearly doubled compared to the uncoated LDs, indicating the eta(d) value of similar to 50.6% (i.e., eta(d) similar to 25.5% for the uncoated LDs).

AB Cd3As2 is an important II-V group semiconductor with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties. In this work, we report the large scale growth of single-crystalline Cd3As2 nanowires via a simple chemical vapor deposition method. Single nanowire field-effect transistors were fabricated with the as-grown Cd3As2 nanowires, which exhibited a high I-on/I-off of 10(4) with a hole mobility of 6.02 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1). Photoresponse properties of the Cd3As2 nanowires were also investigated by illuminating the nanowires with white light by varying intensities. Besides, flexible photodetectors were also fabricated on flexible PET substrate, showing excellent mechanical stablility and flexible electro-optical properties under various bending states and bending cycles. Our results indicate that Cd3As2 nanowires can be the basic material of next generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.

AB Periodic Si pillar arrays synthesized by metal assisted chemical etching method exhibit an excellent light harvesting capability, ideal for core-shell structured solar cell applications. To investigate the photovoltaic prospective, a radial heterojunction device is fabricated by conformal coating a layer of Al doped ZnO film on the p-Si pillar array. This core-shell structure has achieved low reflectance (< 12%) over a broad wavelength range, and has demonstrated more than doubled enhancement of the short-circuit current as compared to the traditional planar architecture. Although reverse recovery transient measurement shows that this device with no surface passivation has shorter minority carrier life time than the planar structure, the overall efficiency is enhanced. It suggests that device efficiency could be much improved through proper surface treatment. This renders a promising path for core-shell structured solar cell with higher efficiency yet reduced material per device element. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate the fabrication of three dimensional hierarchical ZnO/Si nanowire core-shell structure, which is used as a high surface area photoelectrode in photoelectrochemical cells for solar water splitting. This structure is fabricated via a two-step solution process: fabricating vertical aligned silicon nanowires via metal assisted etching method and then growing ZnO nanowires on the silicon nanowires via hydrothermal method. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, spectrometer and X-ray diffractmeter are employed to characterize the hierarchical structure. The surface area of the hierarchical structure increases significantly compared to the simplex nanowire structure, which can substantially promote the photoelectrochemical reactions. The core shell characteristic is beneficial to the charge carrier separation and the silicon nanowire backbones can work as the charge transfer channels, which contribute to the efficiency improvement. The experimental results indicate that the photocurrent density and the maximum conversion efficiency of the hierarchical structure photoelectrode have increased obviously, confirming that this hierarchical structure is more suitable for the application of photoelectrode than the ZnO nanowires/planar silicon structure.

AB The film properties and solar cell performances of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) fabricated by a newly developed non-vacuum process "Liquid-Si printing method" were systematically investigated by comparing to the conventional plasma-chemical vapor deposition method. The as-printed a-Si:H films showed relatively high Urbach-tail characteristic energy (E-ch), high [Si-H-2]/[Si-H], and low photoconductivity (similar to 10(-7) S/cm). However, the [Si-H-2]/[Si-H] decreased, and the photoconductivity was improved to the device grade level (similar to 10(-5) S/cm) after appropriate catalytic-generated atomic hydrogen treatment. It was also found that the light-induced degradation of the photoconductivity and solar cell efficiency of the printed samples were less than half of the conventional a-Si: H case.

This 3D graphene structure was outstanding electrode network and could form fine interface with Si substrate. Moreover, direct growth method not only simplified manufacturing process, but also avoided damages and contaminants from graphene transfer process. The short-circuit current (J(sc)) increased greatly and could reach 31 mA/cm(2). After HNO3 doping, the energy conversion efficiency was increased up to 5.1%.

The optical characteristics of as-prepared Si inverted nanocone arrays are investigated both by experiments and simulations. It is found that the Si nanocone arrays present excellent broadband light antireflectance properties, which are attributed to the gradient in the effective refractive index of nanocones and enhanced light trapping owing to optical diffraction. The inverted Si nanocone arrays might find a variety of applications in solar cells and photodetectors.

AB High capacity and high density functional conductive polymer binder/SiO electrodes are fabricated and calendered to various porosities. The effect of calendering is investigated in the reduction of thickness and porosity, as well as the increase of density. SiO particle size remains unchanged after calendering. When compressed to an appropriate density, an improved cycling performance and increased energy density are shown compared to the uncalendered electrode and overcalendered electrode. The calendered electrode has a high-density of similar to 1.2 g/cm(3). A high loading electrode with an areal capacity of similar to 3.5 mAh/cm(2) at a C/10 rate is achieved using functional conductive polymer binder and simple and effective calendering method.

AB The dependence of electrical properties of rough and cylindrical Si nanowires (NWs) synthesized by diameter-controllable metal catalyst-assisted etching (MCE) on the size of the NWs diameter was demonstrated. Using a decal-printing and transfer process assisted by Al2O3 sacrificial layer, the Si NW field effect transistor (FET) embedded in a polyvinylphenol adhesive and dielectric layer were fabricated. As the diameter of Si NW increased, the mobility of FET increased from 80.51 to 170.95 cm(2)/V.s and the threshold voltage moved from -7.17 to 0 V because phononelectron wave function overlaps, surface scattering, and defect scattering decreased and gate coupling increased as the ratio of surface-to-volume got reduced.

AB In this study, Aluminum doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) layer is deposited on p-type silicon (p-Si) by spray pyrolysis method to fabricate ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) photodetector as Al doping process can have positive effect on the photodetector performance. Morphology, crystalline structure, and Al concentration of AZO layer are investigated by SEM, XRD, and EDX. The goal of this study is to analyze the mechanism of carrier transport by means of current-voltage characteristics under UV/Vis illumination in two cases: (a) electrodes connected to the surface of AZO layer and (b) electrodes connected to cross section of heterojunction (AZO/p-Si). Measurements indicate that the AZO/p-Si photodiode exhibits a higher photocurrent and lower photoresponse time under visible illumination with respect to AZO photodetector; while under UV illumination, the above result is inversed. Besides, the internal junction field of AZO/p-Si heterojunction plays an important role on this mechanism. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB A tandem solar cell based on a combination of an amorphous silicon (a-Si) and polymer solar cell (PSC) is demonstrated. As these tandem devices can be readily fabricated by low-cost methods, they require only a minor increase in the total manufacturing cost. Therefore, a combination of a-Si and PSC provides a compelling solution to reduce the cost of electricity produced by photovoltaics.

AB Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) colour image sensors are representative examples of light-detection devices. To achieve extremely high resolutions, the pixel sizes of the CMOS image sensors must be reduced to less than a micron, which in turn significantly limits the number of photons that can be captured by each pixel using silicon (Si)-based technology (i.e., this reduction in pixel size results in a loss of sensitivity). Here, we demonstrate a novel and efficient method of increasing the sensitivity and resolution of the CMOS image sensors by superposing an organic photodiode (OPD) onto a CMOS circuit with Si photodiodes, which consequently doubles the light-input surface area of each pixel. To realise this concept, we developed organic semiconductor materials with absorption properties selective to green light and successfully fabricated highly efficient green-light-sensitive OPDs without colour filters. We found that such a top light-receiving OPD, which is selective to specific green wavelengths, demonstrates great potential when combined with a newly designed Si-based CMOS circuit containing only blue and red colour filters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this state-of-the-art hybrid colour image sensor, we acquired a real full-colour image using a camera that contained the organic-on-Si hybrid CMOS colour image sensor.

ID SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS
AB Exploitation of the incoming solar energy is more than adequate to sufficiently meet the energy demands of the modern world. Photovoltaics constitute devices that convert solar energy to electricity. Among them, silicon photovoltaics have been extensively studied, although an emphasis has been given in the last decades towards third generation photovoltaics, such as dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). DSSCs are made of materials based on nanostructured semiconductors as photoanodes, with low cost and transparency. The main semiconductor that has been widely studied is titanium dioxide (TiO2), however the rate of electron recombination blocks the extensively high conversion efficiency. Many attempts have been made in order to suppress these losses and improve electron transport. Remarkable efforts led to doping the electrodes or combining specific semiconducting metal oxides with desirable band gaps in order to improve the direct electron transport, and eliminate electron recombination.
   At the present work, we demonstrate a combination of semiconductors (TiO2, In2O3, with band gaps about 3.2eV and 3eV respectively), where In2O3 acts as a barrier layer that suppresses the back reaction (recombination) and accelerates the electron transport, leading to higher charge collection efficiency. The photoanode was fabricated by TiO2 underlayer and In2O3 top layer due to the deeper conduction band of TiO2 than that of In2O3. Solar cells were fabricated combining these photoanodes with quasi solid-state electrolyte based on I-/I-3(-) redox couple. The structural properties of the films with combined semiconductors were examined with porosimetry methods and scanning electron microscopy. The performance of the DSSCs with negative photoelectrodes made with combined TiO2-In2O3 oxides proved to be higher compared with those obtained for one semiconductor. 17% maximum increase to the overall performance was monitored for DSSCs made with TiO2-In2O3 coupled semiconductors in contrast to the pure TiO2 films.

AB Vertical single crystalline silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with different dimensions can be fabricated by metal assisted chemical etching method. The dimensions of the fabricated silicon nanowires increase by increasing the etching time at 60-80 degrees C. The diameters of the fabricated silicon nanowires were between 117-650 nm and the lengths were between 8-18 nm. The changing in the dimensions has a strong effect on the optical properties of the fabricated silicon nanowires. The absorption decreases with increasing the dimensions of SiNWs. The simulations by using finite difference time domain have been used to investigate the optical properties of the SiNWs. The results of the simulation showed good agreement with the experimental result for the fabricated SiNWs with different diameters.

AB In this study, we propose a novel dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) structure that employs a quantum dot/semiconductor silicon (QD/Si) coaxial nanorod array to replace the conventional dye/TiO2/TCO photoelectrode. We replaced the backlight input mode with top-side illumination and used a quantum dot to replace dye as the light-absorbing material. Photon-excited photoelectrons can be effectively transported to each silicon nanorod and conveyed to the counter electrode. We use two-stage metal-assisted etching (MAE) to fabricate the micro-nano hybrid structure on a silicon substrate. We then use the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method to synthesize a Sb2S3 quantum dot on the surface of each silicon nanorod to form the photoelectrode for the quantum dot/semiconductor silicon coaxial nanorod array. We use a xenon lamp to simulate AM 1.5 G (1000 W/m(2)) sunlight. Then, we investigate the influence of different silicon nanorod arrays and CBD deposition times on the photoelectric conversion efficiency. When an NH (N-type with high resistance) silicon substrate is used, the QD/Si coaxial nanorod array synthesized by three runs of Sb2S3 deposition shows the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency of 0.253%. The corresponding short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor are 5.19 mA/cm(2), 0.24 V, and 20.33%, respectively.

AB Photovoltaic research and technology have grown exponentially in recent years due to the continuing and increasing global demand for energy. However, to be economical for global production and utilization, the efficiency of solar cells must increase without escalating manufacturing costs. Because of the abundance of silicon and vast knowledge obtained from silicon study, exhaustive exploitation of silicon-based solar cell design is vital to meet both criteria. Positive thermal control and improved photon recycling are two methods to increase solar cell efficiency. A recently developed hybrid multi-junction silicon (HMJ-Si) solar cell architecture was designed to positively manage these two factors, as well as the common resulting photonic interference pattern generated from the electrical contact gratings. Because of the integrated air gap between two stacked silicon substrates, this sandwiched-cavity imparted a 1.7 degrees C differential temperature. The top and bottom substrates were electrically connected in parallel via a copper o-ring with a thickness of 385 mu m which was the optimal, calculated air gap distance for photon propagation wavelengths of 800nm - 1100nm. The HMJ-Si solar cell was tested using a solar simulator with an air mass 1.5 full spectrum sunlight output and a class II pyranometer with a spectral response of 310nm - 2800nm. The HMJ-Si solar cell demonstrated photovoltaic efficiency of 8-10%.

AB Crystalline Si solar cell based on thin film transfer technique is low cost and high efficiency. Preparation of double layered porous Si is one of the methods to realize thin film transfer. Double layered porous Si was fabricated by a two-step anodic oxidation method in this paper. Si wafers were etched in the electrolyte solutions to form porous Si and annealed in H-2 at 1000 degrees C for 1 h. The surface morphologies and structures of the samples were observed by SEM. The results show that with the HF concentration increased, the pore size of porous Si is reduced. After annealing, the morphology of the starting layer have been changed from spongy pore channels to dendritic pore channels. And the porosity of the separation layer is obviously larger than that of starting layer, so that it can be as a sacrificial layer to realize thin film transfer.

AB In the thin-film photovoltaic industry, to achieve a high light scattering in one or more of the cell interfaces is one of the strategies that allow an enhancement of light absorption inside the cell and, therefore, a better device behavior and efficiency. Although chemical etching is the standard method to texture surfaces for that scattering improvement, laser light has shown as a new way for texturizing different materials, maintaining a good control of the final topography with a unique, clean, and quite precise process.
   In this work AZO films with different texture parameters are fabricated. The typical parameters used to characterize them, as the root mean square roughness or the haze factor, are discussed and, for deeper understanding of the scattering mechanisms, the light behavior in the films is simulated using a finite element method code. This method gives information about the light intensity in each point of the system, allowing the precise characterization of the scattering behavior near the film surface, and it can be used as well to calculate a simulated haze factor that can be compared with experimental measurements. A discussion of the validation of the numerical code, based in a comprehensive comparison with experimental data is included. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The fabrication method of microstructure for monocrystalline silicon wafers based on a mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate solutions under different conditions has been studied in this work. The texturization process has been evaluated in terms of the surface morphology size and the coverage rate. The experiments show that the influence of Na2CO3 concentration is significant by varying the concentration between 5 wt% and 30 wt%. It was shown that with the concentration of Na2CO3 changing, the average size of pyramidal varies from 1.20 mu m to 2.44 mu m. In a word, the surface were not uniform and exhibited wide bright zones in which the texturization process was not successful. However, we find it possible to get a better pyramid structure by the addition of NaHCO3. Uniform microstructure in the wafers of monocrystalline silicon were formed with 20 wt% sodium carbonate and 5 wt% sodium bicarbonate at 90 degrees C for 20 min. Under optimized conditions, the textured silicon wafers surface exhibit a lower average size (about 0.96 mu m) and the coverage rate is high.

AB Indium oxide is one of the basic oxides, and has been extensively studied due to its prominent applications in solar cells, optoelectronics, gas sensors and possesses some interesting chemical and structural peculiarities. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to fabricate these materials as nanosized particles. However, the surface structure and reactivity become increasingly important to the overall material properties as the particle size is reduced. We present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the water and oxygen molecules interaction with stoichiometric and defective (111) In2O3 (IO) surfaces. It is found that water environment destabilizes IO surface with respect to formation of oxygen vacancies. Single water molecule barrierlessly dissociates at all the oxygen vacancy sites except one position with the lowest defect formation energy where water dissociation energy is calculated to be 0.41eV. This should lead to increase of free electrons concentration up to some critical temperature where water dissociation heals surface defects. Another one effect that decreases eliminates free charge carriers is molecular oxygen chemisorptionon surface oxygen vacant sites. O-2 species are adsorbed as peroxide ions that (i) decreases free electrons concentration and (ii) lead to appearance of extrapeaks in optical adsorption spectra. Combination of these factors governs free electrons concentration, i.e. conductivity of nanostructured IO.

AB Over the last decade, plasmonic nanoparticle arrays have been extensively studied for their light trapping potential in thin film solar cells. However, the commercial use of such arrays has been limited by complex and expensive fabrication techniques such as e-beam lithography. Nanosphere lithography (NSL) is a promising low-cost alternative for forming regular arrays of nanoscale features. Here, we use finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations to determine the optical enhancement due to nanosphere arrays embedded at the rear of a complete thin film device. Array parameters including the nanosphere pitch and diameter are explored, with the FDTD model itself first validated by comparing simulations of Ag nanodisc arrays with optical measurements of pre-existing e-beam fabricated test structures. These results are used to guide the development of a nanosphere back-reflector for 20 mu m thin crystalline silicon cells. The deposition of polystyrene nanosphere monolayers is optimized to provide uniform arrays, which are subsequently incorporated into preliminary, proof of concept device structures. Absorption and photoluminescence measurements clearly demonstrate the potential of nanosphere arrays for improving the optical response of a solar cell using economical and scalable methods.

AB In this work we have fabricated inorganic Silicon solar cells coated by a thin layer of Al-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al). Planar solar cells were fabricated by spin on dopant diffusion method. Thin layers of ZnO:Al were deposited by Atomic Layer Deposition method at different temperatures and ZnO/Al ratios. As a result of the deposition of a large bandgap material on top of the sample, it was found that both open circuit voltage and short current density were increased, leading to a power conversion efficiency increase from 7.3% to 8.5%, which correspond to an increment of about 16% after the deposition of ZnO:Al. This increase could be related to a reduction on the surface defects of the sample after the deposition of the thin layer, but also to an increase of carriers provided by the large bandgap layer. Further investigations are in process to understand in a better way this effect.

AB A basic but comprehensive theory and terminology that applies to all different types of contacts in silicon solar cells has, thus far, been elusive. In this paper, we show that, while there are many desirable characteristics that make a good contact, passivation and low majority-carrier resistance are the two crucial criteria. Since all solar cells have a high density of defects that cannot be reduced at the outer metallic surfaces, limiting minority-carrier transport through the contact remains the only method of passivation. Additionally, when current is extracted from the solar cell, low power loss is achieved through uninhibited majority-carrier transport, which requires a low majority-carrier resistance in the contact. We show that carrier selectivity is automatically achieved when these two criteria are met. Furthermore, we show that selectivity can come from the selectivity of a fabricated layer as well as an induced selectivity in the bulk. We apply these principles to describe a few popular contact technologies and suggest that the same may be done for novel contacts.

AB In this work, a simple solution process (metal-assisted wet chemical etching [MacEtch] method) is used to fabricate high-density silicon nanohole (SiNH) arrays on n-type wafer. SiNH arrays generally produce a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, so that aid for strong light trapping effect between the nanostructures causes high absorption and charge collection via the formation of a core-sheath p-n junction. However, the photogenerated excited carriers are easily trapped by high-density surface defects due to higher surface area prolonging to depth of nanohole (NH). To reduce the surface defects and metal contamination of SiNHs formed by metal-catalyst etching, it is important to further proceed to feasible simple solution treatment. Applying the chemical polishing etching (CPE) treatment to SiNH surface leads to smooth and contamination-free surface. In addition, all the processes mentioned here are energy and cost-efficient.

AB Tandem solar cells using different bandgap materials provide higher energy conversion efficiency than single junction cells. However, the need for current matching and lattice matching often restricts the material selection for multi-junction solar cells. To overcome these challenges, we report AlGaAs/Si dual-junction tandem solar cells fabricated by a combined epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and print-transfer method without adhesive layers. Compared to the stacking methods with epoxies, light scattering as well as the need for heat management are avoided here. Furthermore, the epitaxial lift-off approach can help save substrates for re-use and thus is promising to lower the cost of photovoltaic panels.

New methods of fabricating semiconductor membranes of nanoscale thickness with intrinsic mechanical flexible features are beginning to provide a set of means to lift these constraints by engendering deformable, three-dimensional device configurations that are difficult to achieve with bulk-scale materials while retaining capacities for high (or altogether new forms of) electronic and/or optoelectronic performance. Together with enabling means of deterministic assembly realized via the advancing technology of transfer-printing, these light-weight nanomembrane elements can be distributed over large areas on a soft, bendable, and even biocompatible secondary substrates with high throughput and yields to realize interesting new functionalities in technology. Exemplary cases include: large-area integrated electro-optical systems laminated onto curvilinear or other 3-D surfaces for use in sensing and imaging with capacities for accommodating demanding forms of mechanical flexure; and unconventional hybrid systems for lighting and photovoltaic energy conversion that provide a potentially transformational approach to supplant current technologies with high performance, low cost alternatives. Taken together, the results of recent research efforts illustrate important opportunities for exploiting advances in materials in synergy with physical means of patterning, fabrication and assembly. In this review, we explore several exemplary applications taken from this work, and specifically highlight scalable approaches to high performance integrated systems for low cost energy technologies.

AB Recent studies in monocrystalline semiconductor solar cells are focused on mechanically stacking multiple cells from different materials to increase the power conversion efficiency. Although, the results show promising increase in the device performance, the cost remains as the main drawback. In this study, we calculated the theoretical limits of multi-stacked 1D and 2D microstructered inorganic monocrstalline solar cells. This system is studied for Si and Ge material pair. The results show promising improvements in the surface reflection due to enhanced light trapping caused by photon-microstructures interactions. The theoretical results are also supported with surface reflection and angular dependent power conversion efficiency measurements of 2D axial microwall solar cells. We address the challenge of cost reduction by proposing to use our recently reported mass-manufacturable fracture-transfer- printing method which enables the use of a monocrystalline substrate wafer for repeated fabrication of devices by consuming only few microns of materials in each layer of devices. We calculated thickness dependent power conversion efficiencies of multistacked Si/Ge microstructured solar cells and found the power conversion efficiency to saturate at % 26 with a combined device thickness of 30 mu m. Besides having benefits of fabricating low-cost, light weight, flexible, semi-transparent, and highly efficient devices, the proposed fabrication method is applicable for other III-V materials and compounds to further increase the power conversion efficiency above 35% range.

AB We fabricated semi-transparent metal electrodes with biomimetic artificial antireflective subwavelength grating (SWG) structures at the surface of an ultraviolet (UV) curable polymer, i.e., Norland Optical Adhesive (NOA) 63, film on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates for semi-transparent optoelectronic applications. The SWG patterns on the NOA63 film/PET were transferred from the silicon master molds with the conical SWG arrays by soft lithography. As a metal electrode, a silver (Ag) layer was deposited on the surface of the NOA63 SWG/PET substrates for different layer thicknesses. Compared with the Ag-coated flat bare PET (i.e., Ag/PET), the Ag/NOA63 SWG/PET showed a superior optical performance over a wide wavelength range of 400-1800 nm. At the Ag layer thickness of 17 nm, the Ag/NOA63 SWG/PET had lower average reflectance (R-avg) and higher average transmittance (T-avg) values of similar to 25.1% and similar to 33.9% than those (i.e., R-avg similar to 55.2% and T-avg similar to 26.4%) of the Ag/PET, respectively, indicating the maximum figure of merit value of 10.23 x 10(-6) ohm(-1) (i.e., transmittance of 0.458 at a wavelength of 550 nm and sheet resistance of 39.71 ohm sq(-1)). Furthermore, the surface plasmon resonance phenomina (i.e., strong electric and magnetic fields) were observed around the surface of the Ag layer on NOA63 SWGs. Also, it exhibited less angle-dependent optical characteristics at light incident angles of 20-70 degrees under non-polarized light. For optical behaviors, theoretical analyses were also performed by a rigorous coupled-wave analysis method, which gives a similar tendency with the experimentally measured data.

AB We developed a flexible graphene-silicon (Gr-Si) photovoltaic device with high reliability and stability. Ultrathin Si film was fabricated via an anisotropic Si etching method, and exhibited excellent flexibility. Different from the traditional graphene transfer approach, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) film remained, by which the physical damage of graphene resulting from the PMMA dissolution process is avoided. Moreover, PMMA film could serve as an antireflection layer that reduces the reflectance from 40% to lower than 20%. The power conversion efficiency of a PMMA-Gr-Si film solar cell reached 5.09%, which far exceeds the efficiency of a Gr-Si solar cell with the same thickness of Si film of 10.6 mm. More importantly, the PMMA film worked as a packaging material to improve the device stability. The PMMA-Gr-Si solar cell could keep 93% of the original efficiency after bending 60 times. The simple, low-cost and flexible photovoltaic device shows promising prospects in potential applications for portable and wearable electronic products.

AB In this work, high quality titanium dioxide thin films were grown by an efficient, less expensive and rapid method of Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (APCVD) from TiCl4 precursor for application as antireflection coatings on monocrystalline silicon solar cells with the aim to reduce the front surface reflection losses. The microstructural, electrical and optical properties of the produced coatings were successfully characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Four Point Probe (FPP) and Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE). The produced coatings were uniform, homogenous and relatively smooth. The density of the deposited TiO2 films is found to be rho' = 3.11 g/cm(3). The porosity of these films is estimated to phi = 24 %. A perfect agreement between the AFM results and the ellipsometric results was confirmed. The refractive index of our TiO2 thin films was found to be n = 2.25 at the wavelength lambda = 550 nm, with a thickness of 56.2 nm. Our results show the possibility to fabricate TiO2 layers with the optimal optical qualities required for antireflection coating, using the APCVD technique. An excellent agreement is reached between our experimental results and calculated results for TiO2 single-layer antireflection coating on monocrystalline silicon solar cells. The electrical resistivity of the deposited TiO2 films at 450 degrees C annealed at 450 degrees C for 1 hr, was found to be rho = 1.7 x 10(-3) Omega.cm. The sheet resistance of our TiO2 films was equal to R-alpha = 303 Omega/square. The obtained results demonstrate the real opportunity of the APCVD technique to prepare high quality antireflection coatings for high efficiency silicon solar cells.

AB A 43-mu m-thick Si(111) substrate was obtained using the stress-induced lift-off method with a screen-printed metal paste layer as the stress-generation layer. The reflection of the metal-removed side of the Si(111) substrate was lower than that of the exfoliated side because of high surface roughness resulting from the reaction between the metal paste and the silicon substrate at 700 degrees C. After aggressive etching with an alkaline solution for the peeled silicon substrate, the efficiency of the heterojunction silicon solar cell was improved from 0.87% to 12%. (C) The Author(s) 2015.
