AB Broadband antireflection (AR) is essential for improving the photocurrent generation of photovoltaic modules or the enhancement of visibility in optical devices. Beyond conventional AR coating methods, moth eye mimicking nanostructures give new directions to enhance broadband antireflection through the selection of geometrical parameters, such as height, periodic distance, shape, and arrangement. This study numerically and experimentally investigates the behavior of light on complex nanostructures designed to mimic the surface of the moth eye with mixed shapes and various arrangements. To obtain broadband AR, we rigorously study the design parameters, such as height, periodic distance, shape, and arrangement, on a transparent quartz substrate. Several kinds of nanopillar arrays are elaborately fabricated including mixed nanostructures comprising pointy and round shapes in ordered and random arrangements via colloidal lithography. The optimal morphology of moth eye nanostructure arrays for broadband antireflection is suggested in view of reflectance and average weight transmittance.

AB The composite of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and MoS3 (SiNWs@MoS3) was fabricated by a convenient method. In comparison with SiNWs, SiNWs MoS3 exhibits remarkably enhanced photocurrent during photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. The photoelectrochemical performance of SiNWs MoS3 is comparable to that of the composite of SiNWs and Pt nanoparticles (SiNWs@PtNPs). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments suggest that the enhanced performance of SiNWs MoS3 can be attributed to small charge transfer resistance (i.e. fast H+ reduction kinetics) at SiNWs MoS3/electrolyte interface, and the large electrochemically active surface area of SiNWs MoS3.

AB To maximize the conversion efficiency of solar cells by improving the trapping of incident light, surface texturing of multicrystalline silicon wafers is a more permanent and effective solution to decrease reflections compared with antireflection coatings. In general, many techniques of wet chemical surface texturing depend on crystal orientation. Also, these processes place a limitation on the growth of solar production capacity due to consumption of the large amount of material, de-ionized water and chemicals. Reactive ion etching (RIE) is therefore useful for mc-Si solar cells with the random grain orientation. In this study, we have fabricated mc-Si solar cells with a large-area (156 mm x 156 mm) by a random RIE texturing method using SF6/O-2 plasma chemistry. A large amount of silicon loss, which is due to saw damage removal and texturing process of mc-Si wafers, have dramatically decreased by applying RIE texturing process. As a result of the optimum RIE process, the best mc-Si solar cell showed conversion efficiency, fill factor, short circuit current density, and open circuit voltages as high as 17.4%, 80%, 35 mA/cm(2) and 620 mV, respectively. This study demonstrates that it is possible to apply the thin mc-Si Solar cells fabrication for low cost and high efficiency in conventional industrial production line. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we present a laser-interference method to fabricate honeycomb textures on poly-Si wafer for reflection reduction. When exposed to three interfering pulsed laser beams at 532 nm, the Si surface was periodically melted in accordance with the interference pattern. As a result, concave holes were generated on the surface because the melted material overflowed and condensed at the periphery. Subsequent acid etching revealed uniform and clean honeycomb textures. The texture depth could be controlled by varying the irradiation condition and a minimum reflectance of 10% was obtained. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that no irradiation-induced damage remained after etching. This approach can be a cost-effective alternative to lithographic processes for fabricating high-efficiency poly-Si solar cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Unique and various textured TiO2 films have been easily fabricated by mist deposition method on silicon and glass substrates with mild preparation conditions. Two kinds of TiO2 nanoparticle with different shape, size, and crystal form were used as starting material, which resulted in a simple preparation process under low temperature and ordinary pressure. It was easy to control the thickness, morphology, and roughness of textured TiO2 film by adjusting the mist deposition conditions such as deposition time, temperature, and the shape and size of nanoparticles. The optical properties of textured TiO2 films before and after spin coating of Ag nanoparticles were investigated. The angular dependence of the reflectance was obviously reduced by textured TiO2 surface and such effect was enhanced by Ag nanoparticles coating. A broad plasmon band of Ag grains was observed in the absorption spectrum of the textured Ag nanoparticle-coated TiO2 film.

AB Recently, inorganic/organic hybrid solar cells have been considered as a viable alternative for low-cost photovoltaic devices because the Schottky junction between inorganic and organic materials can be formed employing low temperature processing methods. We present an efficient hybrid solar cell based on highly ordered silicon nanopillars (SiNPs) and poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The proposed device is formed by spin coating the organic polymer PEDOT:PSS on a SiNP array fabricated using metal assisted electroless chemical etching process. The characteristics of the hybrid solar cells are investigated as a function of SiNP height. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.65% has been achieved for an optimized SiNP array hybrid solar cell with nanopillar height of 400 nm, despite the absence of a back surface field enhancement. The effect of an ultrathin atomic layer deposition (ALD), grown aluminum oxide (Al2O3), as a passivation layer (recombination barrier) has also been studied for the enhanced electrical performance of the device. With the inclusion of the ultrathin ALD deposited Al2O3 between the SiNP array textured surface and the PEDOT:PSS layer, the PCE of the fabricated device was observed to increase to 10.56%, which is similar to 10% greater than the corresponding device without the Al2O3 layer. The device described herein is considered to be promising toward the realization of a low-cost, high-efficiency inorganic/organic hybrid solar cell.

AB Nano-heterojunctions will play essential roles in future nano-electronic and nano-optoelectronic devices. However, their extensive applications are impeded by the complicated multi-step growth method involved and the requirements for precise nanowire (NW) positioning/alignment. Here, we develop a facile method to fabricate zinc selenide NW (ZnSeNW)/silicon p-n heterojunctions by transferring the p-type ZnSeNWs onto a SiO2/Si substrate with pre-defined Si windows; the physical contact of the NWs with the Si substrate via van der Waals force leads to the formation of heterojunctions. Electrical measurements on the heterojunctions reveal their excellent diode characteristics with a relatively small ideality factor of similar to 1.95, high rectification ratio of similar to 10(6), and low turn-on voltage of similar to 0.9 V. Moreover, heterojunction field-effect transistors are constructed based on the p-ZnSeNWs and show remarkable performance enhancement compared to the device counterparts with a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor structure. The enhanced gate coupling between the NW conduction channel and the heterojunction gate is believed to be responsible for the high device performance. Significantly, under AM 1.5G light illumination, the heterojunctions exhibit pronounced photovoltaic behavior, yielding a power conversion efficiency of similar to 1.8%. Our results demonstrate the great potential of ZnSeNW/Si p-n heterojunctions in high-performance nano-device applications.

AB Two silicon microstructrues of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and silicon microchannel plates (Si MCP) have been successfully fabricated combined by standard microelectronics technology and electrochemical method. The performances have been investigated for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by applying silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and silicon microchannel plates (Si MCP) to the counter electrode, respectively. And the electrocatalytic activities of Si MCP and SiNWs electrodes for triiodide reduction were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The two microstructure electrodes consisting of a large number of channels with high surface to volume ratio exhibits a highly interconnected network structure with good catalytic activity. A high photovolatic conversion efficiency of over 7.01% and 7.86% were recorded for DSSCs based on the Si MCP and SiNWs counter electrodes, which is comparatable to the cell based on conventional Pt counter electrode at the same condition. It could be expected that this low cost SiNWs and Si MCP and compatibility with microelectronic technology would make the silicon-based monolithic DSSC available in practical application.

AB A novel type of silicon material, p-type quasi-mono wafer, has been produced using a seed directional solidification technique. This material is a promising alternative to traditional high-cost Czochralski (CZ) and float-zone (FZ) materials. This study evaluates the application of an advanced solar cell process that features a novel method of ion-implantation and backside rounding process on p-type quasi-mono silicon wafer. The ion implantation process substituted for thermal POCl3 diffusion leads to better R (sheet) uniformity (< 3 %). After screen-printing, the interface of Al and back surface field (BSF) layers was analyzed for the as prepared samples and the samples etched to three different depth. SEM showed that increased etch depth improved both BSF layer and Al-Si layer. The IQE result also showed that the samples with higher etching depth had better performance at long wavelength. The I-V cell tester showed that the sample with the etching depth of 6 mu m +/- 0.1 mu m had the greatest efficiency, due to the highest V (oc) and I (sc) . The solar cell fabricated in this innovative process on 156 x 156mm p-type quasi-mono silicon wafer achieved 18.82 % efficiency.

AB We report a plasmonics silicon solar cell design, with the possibility of lower cost and higher efficiency. The proposed solar cell consists of a radial p-n junction silicon nanopillar arrays in combination with metallic nanoparticles resolved at the top of the nanopillars. Relatively simple processing methods such as metal assisted electroless chemical etching and spin-on doping techniques are used for the fabrication of the described devices. Prior to the metallic nanoparticle incorporation, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell with nanopillar arrays with a height of 800 nm was measured to be 10.7%. Subsequently, the optical and electrical performance of the aforementioned topography was studied as a function of nanopillar height. The observations indicate that the electrical performance of the produced devices degrades with increases in nanopillar height beyond 800 nm, however, the optical performance measurements did exhibit the opposite trend. Upon the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles to the previously fabricated nanopillar arrays, the power conversation efficiency of the combined structure was observed to decrease to 7.31%. This can be attributed due to a reduced open circuit voltage in spite of having a higher fill factor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intensive research into ultra-thin silicon solar cell applications has generated interesting approaches to reducing both critical materials usage and their associated device and module-level costs. Here we report an extension of previous work on micro-scale Si solar cells, devices fabricated using precise methods of micromachining Si(111) wafers in conjunction with wafer-scale processing. Here we describe a simple yet robust approach to fabricate the silicon microcells by re-designing the device structure, incorporating a thermally grown oxide layer to serve as a wet-etch and diffusion mask, and illustrate modes of light management and array assembly that can provide high-efficiency PV conversion of light to electrical energy. We report a best cell efficiency of 11.7% under an AM1.5D solar spectrum for an optically thin (30 mm thick) device, which is a substantial improvement over previously reported Si solar m-cells. We show that the improvement attends to both the optimization made in the doping profiles of the device and the presence of the thermal oxide layer, which doubles as an effective electrical passivation and anti-reflection layer. External quantum efficiency measurements specifically show a marked improvement in the blue response that results from mitigating losses due to surface recombination in the high-surface-area, micro-scale devices. We highlight new strategies for integrating these devices into functional, interconnected arrays, using front and backside electrical bus contacts, with optimized spatial distributions on transparent glass substrates. This geometry, with optimized reflector and waveguiding planarization layers, creates a simple concentrator module by redirecting light via internal reflection to illuminate the sidewalls and bottom surfaces.

TI Characteristics of silicon solar cell emitter with a reduced diffused

SO CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article

ID PRECIPITATION
AB The diffusion of phosphorus using a phosphorous oxychloride (POCl3) source in silicon has been used widely in crystalline silicon solar cells. The thermal diffusion process in the furnace consists of two steps: pre-deposition and drive-in. The phosphorous doping profile via thermal diffusion often exhibits high concentrations in the surface-near emitter, which result in a recombination increase. This layer, called the dead layer, should be inhibited in order to fabricate high efficiency silicon solar cells. In this paper, the amount of the POCl3 flow rate was varied during the pre-deposition process in order to minimize the dead layer, and the characteristics of the phosphosilicate glass (PSG) and emitter were analyzed. From the secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and electrochemical capacitance-voltage profiler (ECV) measurements, the emitter formed using a POCl3 flow rate of 1000 sccm contained the least amount of inactive dopant and resulted in reasonable performance in the silicon solar cell. As the POCl3 flow rate increased, the doped silicon wafer included electrically inactive P near the surface, which functions as a defect degrading the electrical performance of the emitter. As a result of this, the removal of the dead layer containing the inactive P was attempted through dipping the doped wafer in a HF solution. After this process, the emitter saturation current density and implied V-oc were improved. The completed solar cells and their external quantum efficiencies at a short wavelength also demonstrated improved performance. A quantitative analysis of the emitter can provide a deeper understanding of methods to improve the electrical characteristics of the silicon solar cell. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrated the efficiency improvement of GaAs single-junction (SJ) solar cells with the single-material zinc sulfide (ZnS) bi-layer based on the porous/dense film structure, which was fabricated by the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method, as an antireflection (AR) coating layer. The porous ZnS film with a low refractive index was formed at a high incident vapor flux angle of 80 degrees in the GLAD. Each optimum thickness of ZnS bi-layer was determined by achieving the lowest solar weighted reflectance (SWR) using a rigorous coupled-wave analysis method in the wavelength region of 350-900 nm, extracting the thicknesses of 20 and 50 nm for dense and porous films, respectively. The ZnS bi-layer with a low SWR of similar to 5.8% considerably increased the short circuit current density (J(sc)) of the GaAs SJ solar cell to 25.57 mA/cm(2), which leads to a larger conversion efficiency (eta) of 20.61% compared to the conventional one without AR layer (i.e., SWR similar to 31%, J(sc) = 18.81 mA/cm(2), and eta = 14.82%). Furthermore, after the encapsulation, its J(sc) and. values were slightly increased to 25.67 mA/cm(2) and 20.71%, respectively. For the fabricated solar cells, angle-dependent reflectance properties and external quantum efficiency were also studied. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America

The structural periodicity (P) and hole diameter (D) of the hybrid SiNH structure are varied to maximize light absorption. In terms of the solar cell performance under the AM1.5G spectrum, the highest ultimate efficiency achieved is 30.5%, when the D = P ratio is 0.8 and P is 600 nm. We have successfully fabricated the SiNH structure based on a low cost electroless chemical etching approach using a silver catalyst. The SiNH diameters formed vary from similar to 200 to 300 nm, with periodicities from similar to 300 to 1000 nm. The SiNH structure reveals a low average reflectance of 4% for incident light in the range 300 to 1100 nm.

AB Texturing the surface of the silicon-based solar cells significantly increases the light absorption contributing to their overall efficiency. Wet anisotropic etching technique utilizing the novel gas-lift effect (GLE) approach is an effective and low-cost approach for texturing commercial silicon solar cells. Two solar cell devices, one based on the novel GLE texturing approach and the other based on the conventional method, were designed, fabricated, and characterized. A significant improvement (more than 100%) was observed in the efficiency of the solar cell based on the GLE texturing approach. This improvement may be contributed to the significant impact of utilizing the GLE approach on increasing the real surface area (resulting in higher electron-hole pair generation) and increased light absorption (decreased reflectivity). The application of the new GLE texturing approach results in considerable improvements in overall power efficiency of silicon solar cells without any additional increase to the production cost.

AB The optical properties of one-dimensional nanostructure-arrayed silicon (1DNSASi), which was fabricated by the metal assisted electroless chemical etching method under different conditions, were characterized in the wavelength range of 220 - 1000 nm. Whether the optical absorption of the 1DNSASi was enhanced relative to that of the polished Si was determined from the detailed morphology of the 1D nanostructures. For the yellow 1DNSASi prepared at a high etchant concentration and high temperatures, its optical absorption was relatively nice in the ultraviolet light region, while a gradual attenuation was shown in the visible and the near-infrared regions, and the optical absorption was lower than that of the polished Si at wavelengths above 800 nm. When the effects of zeroth-order reflectance and zero transmission were combined, the optical absorption of the black 1DNSASi prepared at a low etchant concentration and room temperature was very high (> 99%) in the wavelength range of 220-1030 nm and displayed a slight decrease at wavelengths above 1030 nm. Our results demonstrate that the optical absorption of the black 1DNSASi could be further improved by increasing the etching depth and exhibited its measurable maximum value when the etching depth was large enough. These results indicate that the 1DNSASi may be a promising candidate for high-efficiency photovoltaic devices, high-sensitivity sensors and detectors.

AB The solar cell market is predominantly based on textured screen-printed solar cells. Due to parasitic absorption in nanostructures, using plasmonic processes to obtain an enhancement that exceeds 2.5% of the short-circuit photocurrent density is challenging. In this paper, a 7.2% enhancement in the photocurrent density can be achieved through the integration of plasmonic Al nanoparticles and wrinkle-like graphene sheets. For the first time, we experimentally achieve Al nanoparticle-enhanced solar cells. An innovative thermal evaporation method is proposed to fabricate low-coverage Al nanoparticle arrays on solar cells. Due to the ultraviolet (UV) plasmon resonance of Al nanoparticles, the performance enhancement of the solar cells is significantly greater than that from Ag nanoparticles. Subsequently, we deposit wrinkle-like graphene sheets over the Al nanoparticle-enhanced solar cells. Compared with planar graphene sheets, the bend carbon layer also exhibits a broadband light-trapping effect. Our results exceed the limit of plasmonic light trapping in textured screen-printed silicon solar cells.

AB To improve Plasmonic energy harvesting, the Al doped ZnO (AZO) and Si heterojunction was studied for plasmonic photovoltaic applications. Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were embedded in AZO, resulting in direct energy absoption from Ag NPs, positioned close to the junction. This structure has a benefit of avoiding highly doped lossy layers of conventional solar cell structures. Al doped ZnO (AZO) was deposited on n-Si substrate by dual beam sputtering method to fabricate AZO/Si heterojunction solar cells. AZO provides a transparent current spreading effect and rectifying junction with n type silicon (Si). Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were embedded in AZO film (240 similar to 270 nm thick) with a sandwich-like structure. The position of Ag NPs in the AZO film was controlled to be located at 10, 20 and 40 nm distance from the Si absorber layer. Fabricated solar cells show improved performance in terms of the short circuit current (J(sc)) and the quantum efficiency (QE). Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations were carried out to investigate the QE enhancement and optimize photocurrent gain under an AM1.5G solar spectrum. In calculation, absorption enhancement is maximized when Ag NPs are located close to the Si layer in the range of 10 similar to 40 nm. Experimentally, 20 nm distance of Ag NPs from the Si showed the best performance with 0.36 V of open circuit voltage (V-oc), 28.3 mA/cm(2) of J(sc) and 5.91% of coversion efficiency. The QE showed 15% of enhancement around lambda = 435 nm and 5 similar to 10% of enhancement within lambda = 600 similar to 1000 nm.

AB Size dependent properties of nanostructures - quantum confinement effect, optical phonon confinement, multiexciton generation - prompted extensive research of good old silicon, at nanoscale dimensions, for potential applications in next generation device applications. However, for realizing functional devices, a thorough understanding of size related properties and a viable fabrication method are crucial. In this study, we present a thorough Raman analysis of silicon-nanocrystals (Si-NCs) of various sizes fabricated by inductively coupled plasma enhanced CVD (ICPCVD). Si-NCs were realized using a two-step process for tight size control; initially alternating multilayers of SiOx < 2 (SRO) and SiO2 were deposited by ICPCVD, followed by high temperature annealing for phase-separation and crystallization. To study the optical phonon confinement, a series of five multilayer samples with thickness of SRO sublayer (T-SRO) varying from 10 nm to 2 nm were fabricated. Raman spectra for ML samples with T-SRO >= 6 nm exhibited three notable features; a red-shifted sharp peak compared to c-Si, a broad asymmetric shoulder on the lower frequency side and a grain boundary band related to the interface between Si-NCs and SiO2. These features confirm the formation of Si-NCs in SRO sublayers. ML samples with T-SRO <= 4 nm showed incomplete crystallization indicating SRO thickness dependent crystallization. To further study this behavior, the degree of crystallization was quantified by estimating the crystalline volume fraction which was observed to decrease with decreasing T-SRO. Red shift of the Raman peak, in accordance with the optical phonon confinement model, was used to estimate the size of Si-NCs. The sizes so obtained were observed to be in good agreement with the T-SRO values. The study is relevant and encouraging for further understanding of Si-NC based composite material for various applications including next generation photovoltaics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ID SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS; OPTICAL-ABSORPTION
AB Vertical silicon nanowire arrays of different diameters ranging from 90 nm to 190 nm with a pitch of 400 nm are fabricated. Nanowires are arranged in a square lattice and have a length of 1 mu m. Polarization resolved reflectances from these nanowire arrays are measured and significant differences are observed for the reflectance characteristics of the s- and p-polarized beams. A narrow wavelength band of increased absorption is reported by analyzing the reflectance using the finite difference time domain method. The center wavelength of this band shifts toward higher wavelengths as the diameter of the nanowires increases achieving tunable absorption spectra within the nanowires. The wavelength band shifts at a rate of approximately 3.3 nm with every 1 nm increment in diameter. The increased absorption is achieved due to modal excitation and near-field coupling between the nanowires. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Based on the realistic structure, a 3D simulation program using the finite element method is developed to calculate energy band structure, optical and electrical properties, as well as the intermediate band solar cell operation. Both the experiments and simulations reveal that miniband formation enhances the optical and electrical collections. Consequently, detailed electronic structure and conversion efficiency are examined to guide the optimal design of minibands. A theoretically predicted maximal efficiency of the explored Si nanodisk superlattice is 50.3%, which is promising, compared with well-known complicated Si tandem solar cells.

AB Silicon sheets were fabricated via spin-casting, which is a ribbon manufacturing method for photovoltaics. Although the advantages of spin-casting include rapid processing and mass production with no silicon loss, crystalline defects such as random grain boundaries (CBs), sub-CBs, or dislocations are generated from rapid solidification. These defects are an important factor in the decreased conversion efficiency of solar cells. Spin-cast sheets were annealed at 950 degrees C, 1200 degrees C, and 1350 degrees C for 2 h to eliminate defects and to increase the grain size. The effect of thermal processing on the sheets was analyzed by comparing them with as-cast sheets and investigated by electron backscattered diffraction, photoluminescence, and etch-pit density. It was confirmed that sub-CBs were almost completely assimilated with neighboring grains with the 1350 degrees C heat treatment. Suppression of dislocations was observed through the decrease in the D-band peak with low-temperature photoluminescence (PL, 10 K), and few dislocation clusters were observed from the Secco-etched sheet annealed at 1350 degrees C.

AB Achieving a broadband antireflection property from material surfaces is one of the highest priorities for those who want to improve the efficiency of solar cells or the sensitivity of photo-detectors. To lower the reflectance of a surface, we are concerned with the study of the optical response of flat-top and patterned-topped cone shaped silicon gratings, based on previous work exploring pyramid gratings. Through rigorous numerical methods such as Finite Different Time Domain, we first designed several flat-top structures that theoretically demonstrate an antireflective character within the middle infrared region. From the opto-geometrical parameters such as period, depth and shape of the pattern determined by numerical analysis, these structures have been fabricated using controlled slope plasma etching processes. In order to extend the antireflective properties up to the visible wavelengths, patterned-topped cones have been fabricated as well. Afterwards, optical characterizations of several samples were carried out. Thus, the performances of the flat-top and patterned-topped cones have been compared in the visible and mid infrared range.

AB High material quality InP-based multilayer nanopillar (NP) arrays are fabricated using a combination of self-assembly of silica particles for mask generation and dry etching. In particular, the NP arrays are made from user-defined epitaxial multilayer stacks with specific materials and layer thicknesses. An additional degree of flexibility in the structures is obtained by changing the lateral diameters of the NP multilayer stacks. Pre-defined NP arrays made from InGaAsP/InP and InGaAs/InP NPs are then used to generate substrate-free nanodisks of a chosen material from the stack by selective etching. A soft-stamping method is demonstrated to transfer the generated nanodisks with arbitrary densities onto Si. The transferred nanodisks retain their smooth surface morphologies and their designed geometrical dimensions. Both InP and InGaAsP nanodisks display excellent photoluminescence properties, with line-widths comparable to unprocessed reference epitaxial layers of similar composition. The multilayer NP arrays are potentially attractive for broad-band absorption in third-generation solar cells. The high optical quality, substrate-free InP and InGaAsP nanodisks on Si offer a new path to explore alternative ways to integrate III-V on Si by bonding nanodisks to Si. The method also has the advantage of re-usable III-V substrates for subsequent layer growth.

AB We have developed nanosized structures on a silicon surface by the reactive ion etching method. The purpose of this work is to fabricate pyramid-nanocolumn structures for crystalline silicon solar cells using a reactive ion etching (RIE) system with a metal mesh and to simulate surface texturing structures using the PC1D program. The reflectance of the structures was lower than that of only-pyramid or only-nanocolumn structure arrays. We formed micropyramids by general anisotropic saw damage removal (SDR) etching using potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, as well as nanocolumn structures by RIE with a metal mesh and SF6/O-2 gas (35/30 sccm). We studied the fundamentals and morphologies of structures (micropyramids, nanocolumn structures, and pyramid-nanocolumn structures). Owing to anisotropic SDR etching in KOH solution for a single-crystalline silicon wafer, the whole wafer surface is covered with pyramid structures with a size range of 1-5 mu m. After RIE texturing, nanocolumn structures with a size range of 20-50 nm were formed on the pyramid structures. Owing to binary surface texturing with pyramid and nanocolumn structures, spectra with weighted average reflectances below 3% in the wavelength range from 350 to 1100nm were obtained under optimized condition. In particular, the average reflectance was 1.16% in the wavelength range of 400 to 1000nm without an antireflection coating (ARC). The combination of the pyramid and nanostructures has a very low reflectance. Therefore, ARC is not required in the solar cell process in the case of using pyramid-nanocolumn structures.

AB Silicon nanocrystals in a dielectric matrix can form a material with higher band gap than that of. bulk crystalline silicon and can therefore be applied as stable top solar cells for an all-silicon based tandem solar cell. In this review article we focus on one proven method to fabricate such structures, the superlattice approach, as cost-efficiency seems to be possible which is essential for photovoltaic applications. We comprehensively discuss the different challenges for competing material systems such as SiO2, Si3N4 and SiC and give an overview on what is known so far in terms of electro-optical performance of the materials. So far, devices using silicon nanocrystals have been realised either on silicon wafers, or using in-situ doping in the superlattice deposition which may hinder the nanocrystal formation. Nevertheless, V-oc of up to 518 mV has been shown on such devices. In this paper we also present a membrane structure which allows the investigation of the electrical and photovoltaic properties of nanocrystal quantum dot layers independently from the substrate and unaffected by dopant diffusion. The device structure provides full flexibility in the material choice of both, i.e. electron and hole, contacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A variety of defect healing methods was analyzed for optimization of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cells on glass. The films were fabricated by solid phase crystallization of amorphous silicon deposited either by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or by electron-beam evaporation (EBE). Three different rapid thermal processing (RTP) set-ups were compared: A conventional rapid thermal annealing oven, a dual wavelength laser annealing system and a movable two sided halogen lamp oven. The two latter processes utilize focused energy input for reducing the thermal load introduced into the glass substrates and thus lead to less deformation and impurity diffusion. Analysis of the structural and electrical properties of the poly-Si thin films was performed by Suns-V-oc measurements and Raman spectroscopy. 1 cm(2) cells were prepared for a selection of samples and characterized by I-V-measurements. The poly-Si material quality could be extremely enhanced, resulting in increase of the open circuit voltages from about 100 mV (EBE) and 170 mV (PECVD) in the untreated case up to 480 mV after processing.

AB In this paper an innovative approach for Si solar cells based on radial junctions is presented. It consists of fabricating the junction in quasi one-dimensional structures like holes. The hole-based architecture, while maintaining the decoupling between the light absorption and the electrical collection typical of the more common wires and rods, ensures more robustness, numerous waveguide coupling modes and possibility to form non-conformal top contact. Nanosizes also provide the possibility to tune the band gap by quantum effects. Doping of the nanoholes, like in the case of nanowires, presents critical issues like conformality and control of the dopant dose and junction depth at nanometric level. We propose to dope the nanoholes by using a chemical method based on the use of a dopant containing molecules dispersed in solution. We apply the procedure on an array of holes of micrometric sizes fabricated to test and study the method and to properly scale it down and implement it on the nanostructures. Results show that the method provides junction depths in the nm scale with dopant peak concentrations as high as 1019 cm(-3) and that the doping is conformal on the vertical surfaces of the hole.

AB A tandem device which integrates a PVDF nanogenerator and silicon (Si) nanopillar solar cell is fabricated. The Si nanopillar solar cell was fabricated using a mask-free plasma etching technique and annealing process. The PVDF nanogenerator was stacked on top of the Si nanopillar solar cell using a spinning method. The optical properties and the device performance of nanowire solar cells have been characterized, and the dependence of device performance versus annealing time or method has been investigated. Furthermore, the PVDF nanogenerator was operated with a 100 dB sound wave and a 0.8 V peak to peak output voltage was generated. This tandem device can successfully harvest energy from both sound vibration and solar light, demonstrating its strong potential as a future ubiquitous energy harvester.

AB In this paper, a full comparative study of two different kinds of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells (OBHJ-SCs) is presented. The OBHJ-SC of the first kind is fabricated with the commonly used polymer: poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The second one is based on a recently synthesized anthracene-containing poly(phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(phenylene-vinylene) (PPE-PPV) bearing randomly distributed segments of octyloxy and segments of 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains and denoted AnE-PVstat. First, devices fabrication method is presented. Then, solar cells are characterized in dark and under AM 1.5 illumination. The incident photon conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of best cells are measured to calculate external quantum efficiencies (EQE). Next, an electronic circuit, containing photocurrent generator, non-ideal diode with its reverse saturation current and its ideality factor, series and shunt resistances, is adopted to model the fabricated solar cells. Afterwards, different methods are used to determine each solar cell model physical parameters from the current voltage characteristics. In this way, model physical parameters extraction of AnE-PVstat based OBHJ-SC is done for the first time and an efficiency of around 4% is evidenced. Finally, a comparison between the performances of each kind of OBHJ-SC is achieved.

AB Silicon sheets were fabricated by a new fabricating method, spin casting with various rotation speeds of the graphite mold. The microstructure of spin-cast silicon sheets were investigated using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) and scanning electron microscope/electron backscatter diffraction/orientation image micrograph, and the lifetime of the sheets was mapped using microwave photoconductance decay. The silicon sheets were vertically aligned, with sizes ranging from tens of microns to one hundred microns. The as-grown lifetime was measured and found to range from 0.049 mu s to 0.250 mu s. The ASTM number was plotted against the lifetime using ASTM E112 to estimate the grain size. Approximately half of the grain boundaries seemed electrically inactive with meaning of no recombination center since the grains were growth directionally, especially in a longitudinal aligned. It was confirmed that the lifetime of spin-cast sheets makes them suitably applicable for photovoltaics compared to those produced by alternative ribbon-producing methods.

AB The morphology of stainless steel is a key factor that affects the quality and structure of deposited cell material and, thus, the efficiency of flexible solar cells. Electrochemical mechanical polishing (ECMP) combines electrochemical and mechanical actions to reduce surface roughness to the level of tens of nano-meters for some metals. In this study, a novel ECMP system is introduced and electrochemical process parameters are evaluated. Finally, both stainless steel (SS) 304 and SS430 substrates sized 10 cm x 10 cm are polished from average roughness (R-a) of 35 nm, and peak roughness (R-p) of 126 nm down to an R-a of 10 nm and R-p of 65 nm. These roughness values are very close to that of glass substrates. Amorphous silicon solar cells are fabricated simultaneously on SS304-Bright Annealing (BA), SS304-ECMP, SS430-BA, and SS430-ECMP substrates in the same run. The substrates treated with ECMP have better cell performance than untreated substrates. This ECMP process is an efficient and economical method for producing a super smooth SS surface as the substrate for thin-film solar cells.

AB The silicon/poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) core/shell organic/inorganic nanowire array (SiNWs/PEDOT) hybrid heterojunction solar cells are successfully fabricated by silver-assisted chemical etching method and vapor phase polymerization processes. The SiNWs/PEDOT hybrid solar cell shows that the performance is improved greatly and an excellent power conversion efficiency of 3.23% is achieved, which is as seven times as large as that of the planar cell without the nanowire structure. In addition, the studies of the reflectance, the I-V curve and the external quantum efficiency show that the great enhancement of performance for the SiNWs/PEDOT cell is due to the fact that the Si/PEDOT core/shell nanowire structure is successfully fabricated by vapor phase polymerization method, resulting in a high light trapping effect, a large junction area and an enhancement of the carrier collection efficiency.

AB Localized surface plasmons mediated optical transparencies of ZnO/Ag/ZnO, ZnO/Ag and Ag/ZnO have been investigated. These multilayered films have been fabricated using a combination of simple techniques like Spray Pyrolysis and Vacuum Deposition. A clear signature of localized surface plasmons has been observed in transmission spectra due to silver nanoislands. This is in contrast to other previously reported articles, which use mainly sputtering method. Key factor for this difference is the fabrication technique. Salient feature of these multilayer films is also the extremely high transmittance (near 95%) in the range 600-900 nm with transmission minima in the range 450-550 nm. Experimental results are successfully interpreted theoretically using extended Maxwell-Garnett (EMG) effective medium theory and transfer matrix method. These observed results may have potential applications in high efficiency silicon solar cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maskless, random RIE texturing with a gas mixture of SF6/O-2 (SO) and SF6/O-2/Cl-2 (SOC) was investigated to achieve higher efficiency for me-Si solar cells. Cone structure with aspect ratio of 3.7 was highly effective for reducing surface reflectance particularly for wavelength from 310 to 700 nm and triangular pyramid structure with aspect ratio of 2 revealed rather uniform reduction of reflectance with respect to the optimized wet texturing for whole wavelength range of 310-1100 nm. On the contrary to results of reflectance, performances of fabricated cell were much better for triangular pyramid structure than cone structure. The degradation of cell performances for the cone structure was assigned both to the poor e-h pair generation efficiency relevant to the formation of highly defective surface layer with high density recombination centers, and ohmic shunt. The efficiency enhancement by 0.6% in me-Si solar cells with triangular pyramid structures was assigned also to the slightly enhanced e-h pair generation efficiency with respect to the reference cell.

ID POWER
AB Pt-decorated nanostructured silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are incorporated into the counter electrode (CE) of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Pt particles are introduced to the SiNWs uniformly by electroplating method and compared to a CE fabricated with sputtered Pt, the catalytic activity and charge transfer rate are improved notably. 0.5% of electroplated Pt on the SiNWs electrode introduces an electrochemical active higher than that offered by sputtered Pt CE. The resulting energy-conversion efficiency (eta) is similar to 8.30% (under an illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)) which is better than 7.67% achieved from a similar device comprising a sputtered Pt CE. This results indicate that the composite film with high conductivity, large active surface area, and good catalytic properties for I-3(-) reduction has large potential as the counter electrode in a high-performance DSSC thereby rendering silicon catalyst-based monolithic DSSC commercially practical.

AB Mono-crystalline silicon single heterojunction solar cells on flexible, ultra-thin (similar to 25 mu m) substrates have been developed based on a kerf-less exfoliation method. Optical and electrical measurements demonstrate maintained structural integrity of these flexible substrates. Among several single heterojunction similar to 25 mu m thick solar cells fabricated with un-optimized processes, the highest open circuit voltage of 603 mV, short circuit current of 34.4 mA/cm(2), and conversion efficiency of 14.9% are achieved separately on three different cells. Preliminary reliability test results that include thermal shock and highly accelerated stress tests are also shown to demonstrate compatibility of this technology for use in photovoltaic modules.

AB In this paper, pyramid-structured silicon wafers were etched in a reactive ion etching system at room temperature and without any negative voltage pulses to obtain antireflective nanostructures. The effects of the etching time, etching power and the flow ratio of the SF6 and O-2 (F-SF6/F-O2) on the morphologies and reflective properties of the etched samples were studied. Scanning electron microscope was used to investigate the morphologies of etched samples. The surface reflectance measurements were carried out using UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. A reflectance of 4.72% from the etched surface in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm was obtained under etching time of 20 min, etching power of 150 W and F-SF6/F-O2 of 18 sccm/6 sccm. Meanwhile, samples etched with F-O2 lower than 6 sccm can't get low reflective silicon structure. Besides, the results show that overlong etching time of 30 min and too big etching power of 225 W would make the nanostructures too sparse to obtain a low reflectance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB A high aspect ratio conical sub-wavelength structure (SWS) was designed by using rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method and was realized on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film using a stamping technique. The silicon template containing a hexagonal array of conical holes with a period of 350 nm and an aspect ratio of 2.8 was fabricated by electron-beam (e-beam) lithography followed by a two-step etching process. The SWS with a high aspect ratio was easily transferred from the fabricated silicon template to PMMA film using the stamping method. The replicated PMMA SWS has an array of cones with nanoscale tips and an aspect ratio higher than 2.8. The average reflectance and transmittance of the PMMA film with the conical SWS in the wavelength ranging from 500 and 1500 nm was improved from 7.1 and 91.1 % to 4.3 and 94.2 %, respectively, as compared to flat PMMA film.

AB We demonstrated a novel, simple, and low-cost method to fabricate silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays and silicon nanohole (SiNH) arrays based on thin silver (Ag) film dewetting process combined with metal-assisted chemical etching. Ag mesh with holes and semispherical Ag nanoparticles can be prepared by simple thermal annealing of Ag thin film on a silicon substrate. Both the diameter and the distribution of mesh holes as well as the nanoparticles can be manipulated by the film thickness and the annealing temperature. The silicon underneath Ag coverage was etched off with the catalysis of metal in an aqueous solution containing HF and an oxidant, which form silicon nanostructures (either SiNW or SiNH arrays). The morphologies of the corresponding etched SiNW and SiNH arrays matched well with that of Ag holes and nanoparticles.

TI Radio-Frequency Inductors on High-Resistivity Silicon Substrates with a

DT Article
ID SOLAR-CELLS; TEMPERATURES; FABRICATION
AB In this paper, spiral inductors on high-resistivity silicon (HR-Si) substrates, which surfaces were passivated by different process methods, were fabricated and measured. The comparison of inductances and quality factors between these inductors shows that the inductances and quality factors of spiral inductors significantly depend on process method and thickness of surface passivation layer. The differently generated passivation layer results in different effective substrate resistivity and hence gives rise to different substrate loss. The experimental results show that using thicker nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) as a passivation layer will result in a smaller substrate loss and hence spiral inductors on the substrate have larger inductances and larger quality factors. In this study, the metal thickness of inductors is 1.2 mu m and is about half that of the inductors provided by foundries. At higher frequencies, the thinner spiral inductors on the SiO2/nc-Si/HR-Si substrate have larger inductances and larger quality factors as compared with the inductors provided by foundries. With the same metal thickness as that adopted in standard processes of foundries, the identical-geometry inductors on the SiO2/nc-Si/HR-Si substrate probably exhibit superior quality factors.

ID RECOMBINATION
AB Silicon wafer solar cells with an aluminum local back surface field (Al-LBSF) are currently intensively investigated for industrial application. One of the main challenges for the Al-LBSF solar cell is the formation of the local Al rear contacts. In our previous work, we have introduced the relative photoluminescence (PL) intensity method to study the Al-Si local contact formation. In this study, we apply this method to experimentally investigate the impact of the geometry (lines or points) of the rear contacts and compare the experimental results with theoretical results that are obtained using Fischer's model. We find that the PL intensity strongly correlates with the p(+) layer thickness and inversely correlates with the void density at the rear surface. Al-LBSF solar cells with different rear contact geometries are fabricated. High R-s was found, especially for those cells with narrower line widths and a large number of voids.

AB In this work, both planar and textured, industrial scale (156mmx156mm) single-crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells have been fabricated using zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods as antireflection coating (ARC). ZnO nanorods were grown in a few minutes via hydrothermal method within a commercially available microwave oven. Relative improvement in excess of 65% in the reflectivity was observed for both planar and textured Si surfaces. Through ZnO nanorods, effective lifetime (eff) measurements were presented to investigate the surface passivation property of such an ARC layer. ZnO nanorods increased the eff from 9 to 71s at a carrier injection level of 1015cm3. Increased carrier lifetime revealed the passivation effect of the ZnO nanorods in addition to their ARC property. 33% and 16% enhancement in the photovoltaic conversion efficiency was obtained in planar and textured single-crystalline solar cells, respectively. Our results reveal the potential of ZnO nanorods as ARC that can be deposited through simple solution-based methods and the method investigated herein can be simply adapted to industrial scale fabrication.

AB Efficient light absorption in thin-film photovoltaic (PV) devices is crucial for improving their efficiency and reducing cost. Here we have not only developed a low-cost and scalable method to fabricate a unique type of Integrated-nanopillar-nanowell (i-NPW) structure by integrating nanopillar and nanowell arrays together vertically, but also demonstrated the attractive optical property of the l-NPW arrays by leveraging the advantages of "positive" and "negative" nanostructures for photon harvesting. Impressively, the 2 pm thick I-NPW arrays with only 40 nm a-51 coating obtained a dayintegrated absorption of 89.27%, as opposed to only 33.45% for the planar control sample. These results suggest the feasibility and dear advantage of vertical integration of three-dimensional (3-D) nanophotonic structures, and meanwhile also pave a viable and convenient way toward a 3-D ultrathin film PV module with potency for high energy conversion efficiency.

AB Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers of naturally textured aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) were prepared on flexible poly(ether sulfone) (PES) substrates by controlling the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering power without chemical wet etching, and their morphological, optical, and electrical properties were characterized. Layers with crater structures were formed at a single RF power; whereas at high RF power (2000 W), their surfaces resembled that of chemically wet-etched AZO. Layers were also formed by dual RF sputtering powers: sputtering a 0.15-mu m-thick layer at high power and a subsequent 0.45-mu m-thick layer at low power produced flakes with larger grains or crater-like structures. The measured visible transmittance of all the layers was >85%-sufficient for use in amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film solar cells. The measured optical and electrical properties of the naturally textured AZO layers are comparable to those of chemically wet-etched AZO layers, suggesting a possible method for fabricating inexpensive flexible a-Si thin-film solar cells in fewer steps.

AB In this work we report a technique that is potentially capable of increasing the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells, which dominate the present-day market of photovoltaic devices. The simple and cost-effective method involves coating the surface of a commercially procured silicon solar cell with luminescent silicon nanocrystals. Core/shell silicon/silicon-oxide nanostructures are fabricated by an inexpensive and reproducible technique, where coarse silicon powders are repeatedly milled, oxidized, and etched until their sizes are reduced so as to exhibit room-temperature photoluminescence under ultraviolet excitation. A thin coating of these nanostructures on a standard solar cell, obtained by a simple dip-coating method, increases the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current, which consequently increases the maximum power delivered by similar to 16.3% and efficiency by almost similar to 39%. We propose that the core/shell nanostructures act as luminescent convertors that convert higher-energy photons to lower-energy photons, thereby leading to less thermal relaxation loss of photoexcited carriers.
