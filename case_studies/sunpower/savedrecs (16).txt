AB High-efficiency micro core-shell solar cell (mu-CSSC) arrays are fabricated from Si wafer by using traditional lithography and phosphorus diffusion. The p-n junction depth is around 450 nm, indicating that it forms core-shell structure in micropillars by using phosphorus diffusion. The mu-CSSC arrays have high minority carrier lifetime of 23 mu s and long diffusion length of similar to 150 mu m. The best power efficiency of the mu-CSSC reaches to 9.2%. It is a convenient method for fabricating Si mu-CSSC arrays in wafer scale for future applications.

AB GaAs nanograss with diameters of less than 20 nm has been fabricated using a simple, one-step, maskless plasma etching-based approach. GaAs nanograss exhibits remarkable broadband antireflection properties, which arise from the graded refractive index between air and the GaAs substrate by the nanograss layer. Moreover, GaAs nanograss shows less sensitivity to transverse electric polarized light and transverse magnetic polarized light over a wide range of incident angles compared to the strong variation in a bare GaAs substrate. These effects show that sub-20 nm GaAs nanograss with lengths of approximately 200 nm has an enhanced absorption of 98-100% when the incident energy is larger than the GaAs bandgap (lambda = 240-873 nm) and an enhanced absorption of 72-98% when the incident energy is less than the bandgap (lambda = 873-2400 nm). Our simple, one-step, and maskless plasma etching method opens a promising approach for the direct implementation of broad omnidirectional antireflective surfaces on solar cells and various optoelectronic devices to improve device performance.

AB We report the effect of antireflective disordered submicron structures (d-SMSs) on glass substrates for the absorption enhancement of thin-film solar cells. The shape and height of d-SMSs were designed on the basis of the calculation result from the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method. The d-SMSs with tapered shape were fabricated on the back side of SnO2:F covered glass substrate by plasma etching of thermally dewetted silver (Ag) nanoparticles without any lithography processes. The glass substrates with d-SMSs showed very low reflectance compared to that of the glass substrates with flat surface over a wide specular and angular range. Thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells were prepared on the opposite side of d-SMSs integrated glass substrates, and the devices exhibited a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 6.84% increased value compared to the reference cells with flat surface without detrimental changes in the open circuit voltages (V-oc) and fill factor. Also, it is found that the performance of the solar cells is sustained over a wide incident angle of light. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solid-phase crystallisation (SPC) of Si films on glass prepared by three deposition methods, plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), electron-beam evaporation, and a combination of both, are compared for different annealing temperatures. Three independent techniques, optical transmission microscopy, UV reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, are used to characterise the crystallisation kinetics and film properties. The activation energy for the incubation is estimated to be 2.7-3.0 eV. The scanning electron microscopy images of polycrystalline Si films after Secco etching show a gradually decreasing average grain size in each film type for higher SPC temperatures. The crystal quality of all film types degrades at higher crystallisation temperatures. Solar cells fabricated from these polycrystalline Si films were characterised by Suns-V-oc and spectral response measurements. According to both the resulting open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, the electronic quality of all polycrystalline Si film types and the corresponding cell performance degrade for higher crystallisation temperatures but to a different extent depending on the film deposition method.

AB We report a systematic study of Si vertical bar ZnO and Si vertical bar ZnO vertical bar metal photocathodes for effective photoelectrochemical cells and hydrogen generation. Both ZnO nanocrystalline thin films and vertical nanowire arrays were studied. Si vertical bar ZnO electrodes showed increased cathodic photocurrents due to improved charge separation by the formation of a p/n junction, and Si vertical bar ZnO:Al (n(+)-ZnO) and Si vertical bar ZnO(N-2) (thin films prepared in N-2/Ar gas) lead to a further increase in cathodic photocurrents. Si vertical bar ZnONW (nanowire array) photocathodes dramatically increased the photocurrents and thus photoelectrochemical conversion efficiency due to the enhanced light absorption and enlarged surface area. The ZnO film thickness and ZnO nanowire length were important to the enhancements. A thin metal coating on ZnO showed increased photocurrent due to a catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction and Ni metal showed comparable catalytic activities to those of Pt and Pd. Moreover, photoelectrochemical instability of Si vertical bar ZnO electrodes was minimized by metal co-catalysts. Our results indicate that the metal and ZnO on p-type Si serve as co-catalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting, which can provide a possible low-cost and scalable method to fabricate high efficiency photocathodes for practical applications in clean solar energy harvesting.

AB The high efficient antireflective down-conversion Y2O3:Bi,Yb films with nano-structure pyramids were grown successfully on Si (100) substrates using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The films microstructure can be controllably tuned only by changing the oxygen pressure in PLD process. With the increasing of the oxygen pressure, the surface morphology changes from smooth surface to pyramid nano-structure, and the preferential orientation of films changes from (222) to (400). Besides, the average reflectance of the films decreases first and then increases, giving a minimum value of 15.8% at 5 Pa as the oxygen pressure increases, which is comparable to that of uniform pyramidal micro-textured surfaces with an average reflectance of 13%-15% fabricated by the complicated chemical etching method. Moreover, upon excitation of ultraviolet photon varying from 300 to 400 nm, near infrared emission of Yb3+ due to transition of the F-2(5/2)-> F-2(7/2) was observed for all samples, which can be efficiently absorbed by silicon solar cell. These pyramid nano-structure down-conversion Y2O3:Bi,Yb films possess promising applications in enhancement of energy efficiency for crystalline Si solar cells by light trapping and spectrum shifting.

AB Although the aqueous electroless etching (AEE) method has received significant attention for the fabrication of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) due to its simplicity and effectiveness, SiNWs grown via the AEE method have a drawback in that their surface roughness is considerably high. Thus, we fabricated surface-modified p-n(+) junction SiNWs grown by AEE, wherein the surface roughness was reduced by a sequential processes of oxide growth using the rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) cycling process and oxide removal with a hydrofluoric acid solution. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed that the surface roughness of the modified SiNWs was significantly decreased compared with that of the as-fabricated SiNWs. After RTO treatment, the wettability of the SiNWs had dramatically changed from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic, which can be attributed to the formation of siloxane groups on the native oxide/SiNW surfaces and the effect of the nanoscale structure. Due to the enhancement in surface carrier mobility, the current density of the surface-modified p-n(+) junction SiNWs was approximately 6.3-fold greater than that of the as-fabricated sample at a forward bias of 4 V. Meanwhile, the photocurrent density of the surface-modified p-n(+) junction SiNWs was considerably decreased as a result of the decreases in the light absorption area, light absorption volume, and light scattering.

AB In this study, we designed and fabricated a poly-Si-based solar cell device by using conventional Si processes. The electrical properties, such as the open-circuit voltage (V-oc), the short-circuit current (I-sc), the fill factor, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the efficiency of prepared solar cell devices, were characterized with a standardized measurement system. Also, the correlation between the photoinduced current and the variation of the defect density was then investigated for various locations by using a photoconductive atomic force microscopy (PC-AFM) system. We verified that in a high-defect-density region such as a grain boundary, a triple junction or a crack, photoinduced carriers easily recombined and induced a decrease in the diffusion length and a low level of photoinduced current. Moreover, we suggest a very effective method to reduce the contact resistance between the cantilever tip and the sample surface, which can disturb the flow of photoinduced current.

AB In this paper, the fabrication of silicon nanodome solar cells on crystalline wafers is reported. Crystalline silicon was patterned by ebeam lithography to define the silicon nano pillars with diameter of 100 nm, 1 mu m and 5 mu m. Unlike conventional bottom up growth of silicon nanowire from gold (Au), our method is free from contaminant. Consequently, it is a valuable method to fully evaluate the effect of nanostructures on solar cell performances. The fabricated devices were characterized through scanning electron microscopy, absorption measurements, illuminated solar cell I-V characteristics and monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency.

AB A 3 mu m thick silicon thin film with a textured surface was fabricated successfully by three major steps. First, the silicon thin film was deposited on a sapphire substrate by a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Second, metal paste was printed on the silicon thin film. Third, a thermal treatment was applied on the sapphire substrate. After cooling, the silicon layer, combined with the metal paste, was peeled from the sapphire substrate because of the large differences in the thermal expansion coefficient between the silicon-metal composite layer and the sapphire substrate. An ultrathin silicon wafer of 3 mu m thickness was obtained in this study. Furthermore, a silicon layer with a micro-scale and a nano-scale honeycomb structures can be obtained easily by transferring patterns from the well-designed patterned sapphire substrate.

AB In the current work, tetraleg zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructure has been fabricated using evaporation method, the structural and optical properties investigated using high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) which confirmed that ZnO film is successfully deposited on silicon (Si) substrate. This result is line with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) result which used to imaging the morphology of the film and it indicate that the roughly surface film was obtained. Photoluminescence (PL) emission employed to study the optical properties of ZnO film that showed two PL peaks have been observed; one in UV region at 371 nm (3.34 eV) and the other in visible region at 530 nm (2.34 eV). The visible emission of PL spectrum which attributed to the yellow defects inside the films has high intensity. This is expected to provide a suitable antireflection coating (ARC) for enhancing the efficiency of the photovoltaic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors.

Nano Lett. 2008, 8, (8), 2283-2288) show the comparable or superior performance to the bulk crystals possessing the same chemical compositions because of the dramatically reduced thermal conductivity due to phonon scattering at nanoscale surface and interface. Up to date, the majority of the thermoelectric devices made from these inorganic nanostructures are fabricated into rigid configuration. The explorations of truly flexible composite-based flexible thermoelectric devices (See, K. C.; et al. Nano Left. 2010, 10, (11), 4664-4667) have thus far achieved much less progress, which in principle could significantly benefit the conversion of waste heat into electricity or the solid-state cooling by applying the devices to any kind of objects with any kind of shapes. Here we report an example using a scalable solution-phase deposition method to coat thermoelectric nanocrystals onto the surface of flexible glass fibers. Our investigation of the thermoelectric properties yields high performance comparable to the state of the art from the bulk crystals and proof-of-concept demonstration also suggests the potential of wrapping the thermoelectric fibers on the industrial pipes to improve the energy efficiency.

AB Freestanding silicon nanocrystals (Si-ncs) offer unique optical and electronic properties for new photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and other electronic devices. A method to fabricate Si-ncs which is scalable to industrial usage has been developed in recent years. However, barriers to the widespread utilization of these nanocrystals are the presence of charge-trapping defects and an oxide shell formed upon ambient atmosphere exposure hindering the charge transport. Here, we exploit low-cost post-growth treatment routes based on wet-etching in hydrofluoric acid plus surface hydrosilylation or annealing enabling a complete native oxide removal and a reduction of the defect density by up to two orders of magnitude. Moreover, when compared with only H-terminated Si-ncs we report an enhancement of the conductivity by up to a factor of 400 for films of HF etched and annealed Si-ncs, which retain a defect density below that of untreated Si-ncs even after several months of air exposure. Further, we demonstrate that HF etched and hydrosilylated Si-ncs are extremely stable against oxidation and maintain a very low defect density after a long-term storage in air, opening the possibility of device processing in ambient atmosphere.

AB Growing single-crystal semiconductors directly on an amorphous substrate without epitaxy or wafer bonding has long been a significant fundamental challenge in materials science. Such technology is especially important for semiconductor devices that require cost-effective, high-throughput fabrication, including thin-film solar cells and transistors on glass substrates as well as large-scale active photonic circuits on Si using back-end-of-line CMOS technology. This work demonstrates a CMOS-compatible method of fabricating high-quality germanium single crystals on amorphous silicon at low temperatures of <450 degrees C. Grain orientation selection by geometric confinement of polycrystalline germanium films selectively grown on amorphous silicon by chemical vapor deposition is presented, where the confinement selects the fast-growing grains for extended growth and eventually leads to single crystalline material. Germanium crystals grown using this method exhibit (110) texture and twin-mediated growth. A model of confined growth is developed to predict the optimal confining channel dimensions for consistent, single-crystal growth. Germanium films grown from one-dimensional confinement exhibit a 200% grain size increase at 1 mu m film thickness compared to unconfined films, while 2D confinement growth achieved single crystal Ge. The area of single crystalline Ge on amorphous layers is only limited by the growth time. Significant enhancement in room temperature photoluminescence and reduction in residual carrier density have been achieved using confined growth, demonstrating excellent optoelectronic properties. This growth method is readily extensible to any materials system capable of selective non-epitaxial deposition, thus allowing for the fabrication of devices from high-quality single crystal material when only an amorphous substrate is available.

AB Transparent conducting fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) films are fabricated onto glass substrates using a simplified spray pyrolysis technique at a substrate temperature of 340 degrees C. The optical constants such as refractive index, absorption coefficient, extinction coefficient are estimated using the Swanepoel method and the solvent volume dependence of these optical constants are investigated in detail and reported. The refractive index (n(f)) of the film is found to be in the range of 1.671-1.675. It is observed that the refractive index increases sharply near the optical absorption edge and the n(f) decreases with the increase in the solvent volume which may be mainly attributed to the increase in the carrier concentration. The optical band gap (3.62 - 3.70 eV) and the band edge sharpness of the films are found to be increased with the solvent volume.

Bypass diodes which have the opposite p-n junction were formed by printing specific paste on the local surface of solar cells using screen printing, while infrared laser was applied to isolate the diode from the cell after firing. A module of crystalline silicon solar cells with integrated bypass diodes was fabricated and the I-V characteristics were measured under different shade conditions. The experimental results clearly showed that the integrated bypass diodes can effectively stabilize module's short circuit current while reduce the module power loss when shaded as well.

AB The dispensing printing was applied to fabricate the front electrodes of silicon solar cell. In this method, a micro channel nozzle and normal Ag paste were employed. The aspect ratio and line width of electrodes could be controlled by the process variables such as the inner diameter of nozzle, dispensing speed, discharge pressure, and the gap between wafer and nozzle. For the nozzle with the inner diameter of 50 mu m, the line width and aspect ratio of electrode were under 90 mu m and more than similar to 0.2, respectively. When comparing the efficiency of solar cell prepared by conventional screen printing and the dispensing printing, the latter exhibited 19.1%, which is 0.8% absolute higher than the former even with the same Ag paste. This is because the electrode by dispensing printing has uniform aspect ratio and narrow line width over the length of electrode. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanocrystalline porous silicon (nc-PSi), a material already widely studied for application in photonics, optoelectronics and sensing devices, is currently under investigation as an active element in photodetection and photovoltaic application as well. Thanks to its unusual properties such as a band gap widening compare to bulk Silicon and its relatively simple and cheap fabrication method, the material could potentially be used as an active top-cell material in multi-junction cells structures. In order to confirm the availability of nc-PSi material as a wide gap absorber for solar cells, free standing layers of the material were fabricated and the results of their optical and photovoltaic characterization are presented in this paper.

AB The life cycle assessment of silicon wafer processing for microelectronic chips and solar cells aims to provide current and comprehensive data. In view of the very fast market developments, for solar cell fabrication the influence of technology and capacity variations on the overall environmental impact was also investigated and the data were compared with the widely used ecoinvent data.
   Existing material flow models for silicon wafer processing for microelectronic chips and solar cells used for engineering and planning formed a starting point for this analysis. The models represent an average of widely used processes and associated process equipment. The resulting input/output tables formed the data basis for the life cycle assessment. This is a cradle-to-gate investigation, consisting of primary gate-to-gate data for wafer processing. The upstream processes of the necessary inputs were supplemented with data from ecoinvent v2.0. Subsequent manufacturing steps, utilization, and waste disposal of the final products were not included. The software used for creating the inventory and impact assessment was Umberto version 5.5. The Impact 2002+ method was applied for impact assessment.
   For both semiconductor and solar cell fabrication, energy consumption and upstream chemicals production are most relevant for the overall potential environmental impact when only the gate-to-gate processes are considered. The upstream process for wafer production is dominant in solar cell fabrication, but exerts little influence on semiconductor fabrication. In the case of semiconductor fabrication, a comparison with the present ecoinvent dataset "wafer, fabricated, for integrated circuit, at plant" shows large differences.
   In the case of silicon solar cells, the results of this study and the ecoinvent data are very similar and the impact of different fabrication processes appears to be minor.

AB In this study, we have fabricated and characterized the silicon [Si] wire solar cells with conformal ZnO nanorod antireflection coating [ARC] grown on a Al-doped ZnO [AZO] seed layer. Vertically aligned Si wire arrays were fabricated by electrochemical etching and, the p-n junction was prepared by spin-on dopant diffusion method. Hydrothermal growth of the ZnO nanorods was followed by AZO film deposition on high aspect ratio Si microwire arrays by atomic layer deposition [ALD]. The introduction of an ALD-deposited AZO film on Si wire arrays not only helps to create the ZnO nanorod arrays, but also has a strong impact on the reduction of surface recombination. The reflectance spectra show that ZnO nanorods were used as an efficient ARC to enhance light absorption by multiple scattering. Also, from the current-voltage results, we found that the combination of the AZO film and ZnO nanorods on Si wire solar cells leads to an increased power conversion efficiency by more than 27% compared to the cells without it.

ID INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; REAL-TIME; SILICON
AB To establish new characterization methods for Si-based-thin-film solar cells, we have developed spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) techniques that can be applied for the analysis of light absorber layers in the solar cells. In particular, our SE analyses allow the detailed characterization of (i) hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and (ii) microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) thin films fabricated on large-area glass substrates. For the determination of a-Si:H properties, an optical database, in which the optical constants of a-Si:H are described completely by SiH and SiH2 hydrogen contents, has been constructed. By applying this model, SiH2 contents in a-Si:H layers prepared on glass substrates can be estimated rather easily. Moreover, the mu c-Si:H dielectric functions have been parameterized completely by our dielectric function model and this parameterization scheme has been applied successfully to describe the structural variation of a-Si:H/mu c-Si:H mixed phase materials. From the above analysis technique, we demonstrate the high-precision analyses of light absorber layers used in the Si thin-film solar cells.

AB Heterojunction between n-type nanopoly-aniline and p-type porous silicon was fabricated chemically by in-situ polymerization method. Our method leads to excellent coverage of polyanilne and forming of homogenous polyaniline film upon the porous silicon wafer. The composition and morphology of the nano-polymer were confirmed by FTIR, SEM, UV-visible and TEM. Different parameters of heterojunction such as ideality factor, barrier height and series resistance values were calculated from I-V measurements at different temperature range. Ideality factor value indicated that NPANI/PSi SBD represents a non-ideal diode. The series resistance values are decreased with increasing temperature. The results also indicated that the polymerization took place throughout the porous layer.

AB This paper reports the growth of the germanium nanowires (Ge NWs) with a single-step temperature method via vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism in the low pressure chemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactor at 300, 280 and 260 degrees C. The Ge NWs grown at 300 degrees C tend to have a tapered structure and the sidewalls of the nanowires were observed to be decorated with gold. The tapering was caused by the uncatalysed deposition of Ge via CVD mechanism at the sidewalls of the nanowires and significantly minimised at 260 degrees C which leads to the formation of straight and ultra-thin Ge NWs. The sidewalls of the Ge NWs grown at 260 degrees C were also observed not to be decorated with gold. The Ge NWs grown from 0.1-nm-thick Au at 260 degrees C had diameter as small as similar to 3 nm which offers an opportunity to fabricate high-performance p-type ballistic Ge NW transistor and to realise nanowire solar cell with higher efficiency.

AB Photoluminescent PFO nanopillars are fabricated by replication from nanoporous anodic alumina via template wetting method at room temperature. We have studied how the nanostructure and the experimental process influence the photoluminescent properties of the obtained structures. Results show that the nanoconfinement induces chain alignment in PFO nanopillars and modifies the photoluminescent spectra. The synthesis and characterization of these ordered nanostructures have been developed in order to create a new generation of optoelectronic devices such as polymer light-emitting diodes, sensors and organic solar cells.

AB Ultra-thin superhydrophilic titanium oxide films were fabricated on silicon microchannels by an in situ reaction sol-gel method using titanium tetraisopropoxide as a starting material.. By changing the concentration of water in ethanol and reaction time, the thickness of synthesized TiO2 films can be controlled from around 10 nm to 80 nm. The contact angle of as-synthesized TiO2 films on flat silicon is around 20 degrees and can be further decreased to zero by calcination at 700 degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction spectra show the microstructure of the TiO2 films changed gradually from amorphous to anatase with the increase of calcination temperature. Surface morphology of the film before and after calcination also shows that a smoother coating with crystal structure was obtained by heat treatment.
   The flow velocity in the TiO2 coated channel reached around 0.03 m/s, almost ten times of that in PDDA/PSS coated channel and 4 times of that in SiO2 coated one. The ultra-thin superhydrophilic TiO2 films fabricated by this method show the ability to strongly increase the wettability of microchannels without affecting the morphology of the sidewall of the channels, indicating potential applications to biomolecule analysis and surface tension driven microfluidic systems.

AB The advances of semiconductor solar cells enabled a paradigm shift of clean alternative energy generation marked by Bell Labs' first modern solar cell (a.k.a. "Photovoltaic Cell (PV)" made from crystal silicon in 1954. The solar cells fabricated from crystal Si is now reached to its energy conversion efficiency from 6% to 22% in the last 55 years. Still, more developments are going on to bring Si solar cell conversion efficiency closer to its theoretical limit to 30.7%. Solar Cells from other materials such as compound semiconductors is now reached to close to 50%. The late 1990s, energy generation utilizing the photovoltaic effects witnessed another disruptive and yet exhilarating progress enabled by nano-structured materials and devices structured. Nano structure based solar cell can be explained as a method of increasing surface area and increasing the photon capture which, in this case, is a multiple nano-solar cells. The result is a capability to increase the aggregate energy conversion efficiency significantly more than conventional solar cell.

For the first time, a 3D finite element method (FEM) is developed to calculate energy band structure, optical and electrical properties, as well as the intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) operation for the realistic structure. Both the experiments and simulations reveal that miniband formation enhances the optical and electrical collections. Consequently, detailed electronic structure and conversion efficiency are examined to guide optimal design of minibands. A theoretically predicted maximal efficiency of the explored Si nanodisk superlattice is 50.3%, which is promising, compared with well-known complicated Si tandem solar cells.

AB In the past decades, Si has been the most important material for electronics. By exploiting this mature semiconductor fabrication technique, it is also highly desired to use Si for applications in other areas. Here we report the use of Si micro-structures for optical-communications and Si nano-structures for energy applications. Sub-micron Si waveguides is fabricated on Si substrates rather than SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate using laser reformation technique. This method helps solve the incompatible problem for the integration of optics and electronics on a single Si chip. The typical thickness of the oxide layer on the CMOS transistor layer is below 100nm which, however, creates excessive optical loss due to the light coupling into Si substrate. Besides, fabricating Si photonics on Si wafer is much cheaper than that on SOI wafer. The method is using high-power pulse laser to melt high-aspect ratio Si ridges. This creates a structure with wider upper portion and narrower lower portion, which can be further oxidized and forming waveguides. For energy applications, Si nanostructures are fabricated using the metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) technique. Si nanostructures could greatly reduce the surface reflection to enhance light harvest. In addition, Si nanowires are further combined with organic materials to form hetero-junction solar cells using low-cost solution process. Furthermore, the Si nanostructures and MacEtch process are refined to form completely single-crystal Si thin film. Thus the material cost of Si solar cells can be potentially reduced to only 1/10 of current ones.

AB This paper focuses on optimizing silicon based solar cell fabrication using Taguchi Optimization Method (TOM). Optimization focused on 3 parameters namely doping concentration of boron, creating phosphorus PN-junction and energy used for ion-implantation with 2 noise factors, Diffuse time and diffuse temperature. The aim is to have a shallow junction in order to decrease the recombination process but higher fill factor (FF) for better efficiency. Fabricating are done in computer simulation environment by Silvaco TCAD software that also conducting an electrical testing for measurement. Each factor (product from the parameters through TOM) has 2 levels of best values taken from the previous researches. In this research, L-8 orthogonal array consists of 8 set of different combination of experiment has been done. Optimized values are analyzed by finding Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of each experiment and applied it on Larger the Better (LTB) for highest FF and Smaller the Better (STB) for shallowest junction depth. Result reveal that boron at concentration of 5.0x10(15) cm(-3), phosphorus at concentration of 2.0x10(16) cm(-3), and energy at 10 keV gave a result of 0.3 um similar to 0.5 um for junction depth and stable FF value of 0.8 at any noise factor contributing efficiency of 15% to 16%. As a conclusion, TOM has achieved predicting the best solution for optimizing silicon solar cell fabrication.

AB Solar cell is a semiconductor device that converts sunlight into electricity. Bifacial solar cell is a specially designed solar cell for the production of electricity from both sides of the solar cell. Bifacial solar cell became an active field of research making photovoltaic (PV) more competitive together with current efforts to increase the efficiency and lower material costs. In silicon (Si) solar cell, the inability to absorb all the incident sunlight fundamentally limits the Si solar cell performance. As the wafer is efficiently used by fabricate a bifacial solar cell to save on Si costs, efficiencies will become even lower due to incomplete optical absorption. Subwavelength surface texturing helps offset some of the absorption loss. To trapped more lights, anti reflecting coating (ARC) was studied. There are three type of texturing methods and two type of ARCs that has been studied in this research. According to optical properties of the textured Si wafer and ARC thin film, it was found that wet texturing and SiN are the best methods to improve the light absorption in bifacial solar cell. The efficiency obtained from the bifacial solar cell is 9.62% for front side and 4.5% for back surface.

AB This paper summarizes the research outcome intended to identify the most suitable device architecture and its implementation for cell-level power conversion in a photovoltaic (PV) system. The fabrication process to accommodate the power conditioning unit with the PV cells using the same process run have been presented in this paper. Using this method, the entire converter can be embedded with the PV cells producing AC power directly from the solar cell strings. The initial phase of this project simulated various circuit components in the CMOS process, and the project outcome has been summarized in a previous publication by the authors. This paper presents the experimental results of the proposed process, and a simple chopper circuit has been constructed using the embedded MOSFETs and the PV cells. The circuit has been experimentally characterized, along with components. In addition to the process-related challenges and issues, this paper explains the justification of this integration by achieving higher reliability, portability and complete modular construction for PV-based energy harvesting units. To the knowledge of the authors, no attempt has been made to fabricate power converter components with PV cells in the same process run.

AB In this study, a lower-cost and highly compatible laser scanning method was implemented as an alternative annealing process to fabricate quantum well (QW) structures. Ge QW films were fabricated by continuous-wave laser annealing and their potential for energy selective contact (ESC) applications was assessed by structural, optical and electrical characterization. The structural properties were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Cross-sectional TEM images showed the dimension of the QWs to be larger along the direction of laser scanning. Uni-axial tensile strained film properties were found in XRD investigations which showed crystal growth favored in a series of orthogonal direction < 110 > along the laser scan direction due to the laser dragging the liquid phase Ge. Rapid quenching from liquefied Ge introduced stress in the film as shown by peak shifts in XRD and in Raman spectra. Despite that strong optical absorption by amorphous features in the film possibly hinder the quantum confinement presentation as shown in the absorption curves, Preliminary data, presenting tentative current fluctuations in the room temperature I-V measurement, suggest that a double barrier resonant tunneling structure is possible, showing its potential application for ESCs.

AB In this study optical emission spectroscopy (OES) has been used as a diagnostic tool for the prediction of the transition from amorphous (a-Si:H) to microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H). Variation of the optical emission due to SiH* and Ar* at 414.2 nm and 750.4 respectively with respect to rf power were studied during the film deposition by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method from a mixture of silane and argon. We observe that above 80 mW/cm(2) power density the sample properties changed from amorphous to microcrystalline. At the same time a sharp increase in the ratio of Ar* to SiH* in the transition region of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon has also been observed. To check the device quality of the materials we have measured the minority carrier diffusion length. By using these materials as the intrinsic layer we have fabricated and studied single junction solar cell having the structure p-a-SiC:H/ i-a-Si:H/n-a-Si:H. We observe that the solar cells fabricated with the materials deposited at the boundary of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon show better performance.

AB We introduce a novel, high-throughput processing method to produce high-efficiency solar cells via a backside rounding process and ion implantation. Ion implantation combined with a backside rounding process is investigated. The ion implantation process substituted for thermal POCl3 diffusion performs better R-sheet uniformity (<3%). The U-4100 spectrophotometer shows that wafers with backside rounding process perform higher reflectivity at long wavelengths. Industrial screen printed (SP) Al-BSF on different etching depth groups was analyzed. SEMs show that increasing etch depth improves back surface field (BSF). The I-V measurement revealed that etching depths of 6 mu m +/- 0.1 mu m due to having the highest V-OC and I-SC, it has the best performance. SEMs also show that higher etching depths also produce uniform Al melting and better BSF. This is in agreement with IQE response data at long wavelengths.

AB Pyramidal texture is one traditional method to realize antireflection for c-Si solar cells, due to its low cost and simplicity. As one high efficiency silicon solar cell, amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell has attracted much attention all over the world. The heterojunction interface with very low defects and interface states is critical to the SHJ solar cell performance. In order to obtain high quality interface passivation by depositing a very thin intrinsic amorphous silicon layer on the textured Si conformally, large size pyramidal texture with no metal ion contamination is required. In this work, we utilized tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) instead of NaOH in the alkaline etching to prepare pyramidal texture on N-type monocrystalline silicon to avoid the possible Na+ contamination. By optimizing the etching conditions, uniform large size pyramidal texture with pyramid size of about 10 mu m was fabricated successfully. Furthermore, excellent antireflection performance was demonstrated on such textured Si surface. The average reflectance was lower than 10% in the visible and near infrared spectrum range. Such pyramidally textured Si wafers will be very suitable for SHJ solar cells.

The photoelectric property of the sample were measured and compared with silicon solar cell. The result indicated the saturated photocurrent of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction was 20% greater than one of the Si solar cell. It means the ZnO/Si heterojunction has a higher ability of produce photoelectron then one of silicon solarcell. The result of the photovoltaic test of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction show The open circuit voltage and short-circuit current of the n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction was 400mV and 5.5mA/cm(2) respectively. It was much smaller than the one of silicon solar cells. The reason was discussed.

The morphology created by this approach is apparently different from the common method using the femtosecond laser and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). However, the treated silicon area could tremendously reduce the reflection from the surface. The reflectance of the structured surface is around 5% throughout the visible to near IR (1.1 um) despite of the viewing angle, which is comparative. Furthermore, the effect of the reflectance reduction is weaker but still obvious when wavelength is beyond 1.1 um, which is believed to be able to extend to the mid IR range.

AB Phosphorous doped hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) films were prepared using the hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HW-CVD) method at a low substrate temperature of 200 degrees C. The microstructure and opto-electrical properties of these films were systematically studied using Raman spectroscopy, low angle XRD, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), UV-Visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dark conductivity and its activation energy measurements and Hall measurement as a function of PH3 gas-phase ratio. It has been found that with an increase in the PH3 gas-phase ratio, both the volume fraction of the crystallites and its size decrease, signifying that the phosphorous atom favors the growth of amorphization in the nanocrystalline Si network. At the optimized PH3 gas-phase ratio we have obtained n-type nc-Si:H films with a band gap of similar to 1.84 eV, high dark conductivity (similar to 6.78 S cm(-1)) with low hydrogen content (similar to 1.72 at. %), at a reasonably high deposition rate (similar to 10 angstrom s(-1)). Finally, Al/ZnO:Al/n-nc-Si:H/buffer a-Si:H/p-c-Si/Al heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using the optimized n-layer, showing excellent photovoltaic performance with V-OC = 719 mV, J(SC) = 9.94 mA cm(-2), FF = 53.8%, and an energy conversion efficiency of 5.2%. These are very encouraging results for the future fabrication of high efficiency silicon heterojunction solar cells and thin film tandem solar cells.

AB We present the experimental procedure to create lattice mismatched multijunction photovoltaic (PV) cells using 3D integration concepts. Lattice mismatched multijunction photovoltaic (PV) cells with decoupled electrical outputs could achieve higher efficiencies than current-matched monolithic devices. Growing lattice mismatched materials as a monolithic structure generates defects and decreases performance. We propose using methods from the integrated circuits and microsystems arena to produce the PV cell. The fabricated device consists of an ultrathin (6 mu m) series connected InGaP/GaAs PV cell mechanically stacked on top of an electrically independent silicon cell. The InGaP/GaAs PV cell was processed to produce a small cell (750 mu m) with back-contacts where all of the contacts sit at the same level. The dual junction and the silicon (c-Si) cell are electrically decoupled and the power from both cells is accessible through pads on the c-Si PV cell. Through this approach, we were able to fabricate a functional double junction PV cell mechanically attached to a c-Si PV cell with independent connections.

ID SURFACE PASSIVATION
AB Silicon hetero-junction (SHJ) with the a-Si:H/c-Si structure is one of the candidates for high efficiency solar cells. Despite SHJ solar cells show more than 22% efficiency, SHJ solar cells are limited by optical losses on the front surface. To overcome these limitations, silicon hetero-junction back contact (HBC) solar cells are suggested. HBC solar cells combined the advantages of silicon hetero-junction (SHJ) and Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) solar cells. In this study, HBC solar cell structures were designed by simulation methods and optimized fabrication processes for industrial application. Dimensions of back contact patterns were design by TCAD ATLAS software. Based on simulation results, p-type and n-type back contact patterns were fabricated.

ID POROUS SILICON
AB Foil creation by lifting off a thin layer of a high quality silicon substrate is one of the promising substitutes for wafer sawing to create substrates thinner than 100 11m. The porous silicon-based layer transfer process is a well known method to obtain high quality foils. Despite a number of convincing lab-based solar cell show-cases, there is no breakthrough of this technology at (semi)-industrial level, because of the poor yield of processing free standing foils. This paper presents a method to fabricate back contacted solar cells based on epitaxial foils avoiding processes on free-standing foils. First, a porous silicon layer is electrochemically etched, acting as a weak sacrificial layer to detach the foil that is epitaxially grown on top of the porous silicon layer. Characterization of the epitaxial foils shows a good crystalline quality and an effective lifetime around 100 mu s. Those results give indications that the obtained foils are well suited for solar cell fabrication. Front-side processing is done while the epitaxial foil is still attached to its parent substrate. A good yield is obtained for epitaxial foils that underwent the front-side processing sequence consisting of wet chemical texturing, FSF formation, passivation and ARC deposition. Afterwards, the front-side of the foil is bonded to a glass carrier and the foil is detached from its parent substrate. Silicone adhesives are used for this permanent bond. The rear-side of the solar cell is processed while bonded to glass. Therefore, only low temperature processes (<200 degrees C) can be used. So far, the rear-side processing sequence was performed on Float-zone reference wafers as a proof of concept resulting in a confirmed maximum efficiency of 18.4%. The rear-side processing sequence still needs to be applied on epitaxial foils.

AB In this paper, a uniform nanohole structure on silicon wafer is fabricated using the silver catalyst induced method. The optical properties of the silicon nanohole structure are studied systematically at different nanohole depths. The nanohole arrays demonstrate excellent antireflection property due to its sub-wavelength structure with a low reflection loss of 4% for incident light within the wavelength range of 300-1100 nm. The angular dependence of reflectivity is also investigated. The average reflection decreases at first and then increases as the incident light deviated from normal, with a very lower reflectivity of 0.83 % at an incident angle of 20 degrees. The suppressed reflection indicates a strong light trapping ability of the nanohole structure, and provides a low cost method to enhance light absorption and performance for the solar cell application.

DE Al BSF; screen-printed solar cells
AB The back surface field (BSF) induced by a highly Al doped p(+) region is beneficial in reducing the back surface recombination velocity (BSRV) in a conventional industrial type silicon solar cell. The effectiveness of the BSF in controlling the BSRV depends on its thickness and uniformity. The Al-BSF thickness is sAld to depend on the screen-printed Al thickness while the annealing method, rapid or slow firing, controls the uniformity. However, even though screen- printed Al thickness of 25-30 mu m is generally used in the industry and fired rapidly in the belt furnace, there is still a difference in open circuit voltage (V-oc) and efficiency depending on the source of Al paste. In order to understand the source of variation in Voc, we fabricated large area (239 cm(2)) Cz silicon solar cells on commercial 65 ohm/sq emitter using three Al pastes from three vendors, A, B and C. We used a commercial front Ag paste with a known firing profile to circumvent the influence of the front contacts on the cell performance. The best V-oc for cells with Al pastes from vendors A, B and C were 636 mV, 635mV, and 637 mV, respectively. The SEM analysis revealed the average BSF thickness for vendors A, B, and C pastes as 7.3 mu m, 5.9 mu m and 6.9 mu m, respectively. The long wavelength IQE and the LBIC analysis were similar for all the three pastes. This shows that, irrespective of the Al vendor, if the front side of the cell is similarly processed, and provided the BSF is uniform and greater than 4 mu m, similar Voc can be achieved. Therefore, the Al pastes from different vendors are similar in performance provided the front side of the cell is processed with adequate control.

AB We demonstrate a simple and versatile laser assisted technique to produce an inverted pyramid texture in monocrystalline silicon to reduce surface reflectance. With this method the inverted pyramid size, distribution, spacing, and hence the spectral reflection of the textured surface can be tailored. The process removes minimal amounts of silicon during the texturing process, thus making it compatible with ultra-thin silicon photovoltaics. Surfaces with the fabricated inverted pyramid texture and an antireflection coating reflect 4% of incident light.

DE non-photolithographic process; front surface metallization; silicon
   nitride; electroplating
AB In this work we propose and demonstrate a novel method to fabricate semiconductor devices using a shadow mask that allows selective deposition of PECVD layers and selective exposure of doped silicon regions. The exposed regions then act as seed layers for selective metallization by a process such as electroplating. A device structure taking advantage of this process can be completely done without any photolithographic steps. In semiconductor processes where submicron-feature sizes are generally not required and reducing cost of manufacturing is key (e.g. in solar cells), this proposed process flow could be really useful. We have fabricated a conventional diffused p-n junction monofacial solar cell on a monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) substrate using this method. Nickel is electrochemically grown to form front surface electrode. The monofacial solar cell fabricated with an un-optimized process shows an efficiency of 14.5% under AM1.5G one sun illumination. The feature size of metal electrodes formed in this way is 80 mu m and could be narrowed down to smaller size-width. Optimization of doping, surface passivation and metallization would improve the efficiency even further to values in the high teens by improving open circuit voltage (V-OC), current density (J(SC)) and Fill Factor (FF).

AB We demonstrate a novel cost-effective surface micro-texturing method using an electric-arc in argon at atmosphere pressure to enhance light trapping in silicon solar cells. The experimental set-up for electric-arc micro-texturing is described. The morphological, optical and electronic properties of micro-textured silicon surfaces have been investigated. The electronic quality of micro-textured surfaces is studied by measuring the surface minority carrier lifetime (tau(s)) to reveal the presence of surface damage, which can be removed by a short chemical etching step. The quality of the electric-arc micro-textured silicon material is recovered as indicated by tau(s). Silicon solar cells are fabricated on such electric-arc micro-textured and chemically etched surfaces. Initial conversion efficiency of 14.4% is achieved which can be further improved. The effective minority carrier lifetime (tau) of the solar cells is examined by observing the open circuit voltage decay, which shows no degradation of t when compared to chemically micro-textured control samples.

AB Optimization methods, including layer number modulation, graphene work function, and antireflection film addition, are proposed to improve the performance of graphene/semiconductor heterojunction solar cells. Simulation results demonstrate that a maximal conversion efficiency of similar to 11% can be achieved. Schottky junction solar cells based on modified graphene films and silicon pillar arrays have been fabricated and are found to deliver enhanced cell performance with efficiencies up to 5.5%.

AB In this study, we have investigated the effect of refractive index of Soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates on its surface roughness after being etched by Reactive Ion Etching (RIE). It was found that there was a relationship between the refractive index of the glass and etched surface roughness. Higher roughness was obtained on SLG with lower refractive index. Based on this finding, we can easily control the glass etching process and achieve its good repeatability. Furthermore, ZnO films have been deposited on this etched SLG to achieve w-textured TCO substrates. As a result, a-Si:H/ mu c-Si:H tandem solar cell fabricated on this developed substrate has a high efficiency of 12.40% showing that this new morphology control of glass etching is a promising method for development of high-efficiency thin-film solar cell.

AB Silicon nanocrystal (Si-NC) luminescent down-shifting materials for photovoltaic (PV) applications were fabricated by ion implantation and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The absolute optical conversion efficiency of the Si-NC-emitted photoluminescence was measured using conventional methods, and an optical set-up involving an integrating sphere. Modeling shows that down-shifting the light incident on a single-junction silicon cell (SJSC) can improve the cell performance if the optical conversion efficiency is sufficiently high. The measured conversion efficiency of the Si-NCs in a fused silica host was found to range from 0.8% to 1.84% and was compared with the efficiency required to maintain the performance of a SJSC.
