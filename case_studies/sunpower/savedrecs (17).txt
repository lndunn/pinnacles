AB Quantum dots applied in solar cells will be of great importance to enhance the quantum tunneling efficiency and improve the photogenerated current transport. In this study, a new easy-to-operate technology was developed to fabricate germanium-silicon quantum dots in a SiOx matrix. The quantum dots were formed by first deposited germanium-rich SiO on quartz substrate using pulsed laser deposition technique and then annealed under a comparatively high temperature. We have demonstrated a stable and low-cost fabrication process which is much cheaper than the epitaxy method to provide for the fabrication of high density germanium-silicon quantum dots. Quantum dots with diameters of 3 similar to 4 nm embedded in the amorphous SiOx layer were clearly observed. The morphological features of the thin film were characterized. The optical properties were performed by Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum and XRD test respectively to verify the crystallization of quantum dots in the SiOx matrix. Reflectance spectrum displayed a high light absorption rate in a spectra region from 300 nm to 1200 nm, evidencing that germanium-silicon quantum dots have promising features to be used as absorber for photovoltaic application.

AB We present methods for nanostructuring organic thin films for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Using the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, we fabricate a variety of columnar morphologies of metal phthalocyanine (MPc) materials that can be used as structured donor layers in OPV devices. We leverage this capability with block copolymer surface patterning techniques to achieve perfectly periodic columnar arrays while providing additional control over column dimensions, spacing, and density. Our investigation employs hexagonal seed patterns of platinum on silicon and we vary the seed spacing between 40 nm and 60 nm. We find that pattern resemblance begins to fade when the film thickness exceeds the seed spacing. We compare the film evolution between vertical post and slanted post morphologies, and use advanced substrate motion techniques to constrain column diameters. We conclude by addressing the compatibility of surface patterning with device fabrication. Patterned ITO surfaces and SiO2 seed patterns are shown.

AB Light trapping due to rough interfaces is a common and industrially applied technique to enhance cell performance in silicon thin-film solar cells. The induced scattering enhances the absorption and consequently the conversion efficiency of the device. Periodic structures promise to further enhance the light trapping, allowing a beneficial reduction of the absorber layer thickness. In this work, solar cells with transparent front contacts with a two-dimensional (2D) grating structure produced by holographic lithography are investigated. The grating structures are characterized by various means and the results are used to calibrate finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. With the computational method, the influence of the grating height on the solar cell performance is investigated.

AB A new tunnel-recombination junction model was proposed to increase the recombination of n/p junctions in tandem solar cells. According to the model, we fabricated a new tunnel junction with a nano-structured amorphous silicon p(+) (na-Si p(+)) layer inserted between the n layer and the p layer. To compare with the conventional method, we fabricated another tunnel junction with an amorphous p(+) (a-Si p(+)) insertion layer. Both devices were characterized by their dark current-voltage behavior (I-V), activation energy (E-a) and quantum efficiency (QE). The result shows that the tunnel junction with a na-Si p(+) insertion layer has higher recombination rates with higher density of defect states of about 2.7x10(19)cm(-3), lower resistance with activation energy of 22meV. The tunnel junction with a na-Si p(+) insertion layer could be easily integrated into the tandem solar cell deposition process.

The PS substrates were prepared by electrochemical etching method using alternating current (ACPS) and direct current (DCPS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the CdS fabricated on ACPS had two nanostructures, nanoflowers and nanoplates while the CdS on DCPS showed a novel structure named nanofire. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the CdS nanocrystalline structured in watzite (hexagonal) phase. Photoluminescence (PL) of CdS nanoflowers and nanoplates structures showed a high intensity with blue-shift compared with nanofire structure. Furthermore, Raman spectra of CdS nanostructures showed red shift of peaks positions.

AB To improve the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells, should be collected the excess carrier as much as possible. Therefore, minimizing the recombination both at the bulk and surface regions is important. Impurities make recombination sites and they are the major reason for recombination. Phosphorus (P) gettering was introduced to reduce metal impurities in the bulk region of Si wafers and then to improve the efficiency of Si heterojunction solar cells fabricated on the wafers. Resistivity of wafers was measured by a four-point probe method. Fill factor of solar cells was measured by a solar simulator. Saturation current and ideality factor were calculated from a dark current density-voltage graph. External quantum efficiency was analyzed to assess the effect of P gettering on the performance of solar cells. Minority bulk lifetime measured by microwave photoconductance decay increases from 368.3 to 660.8 mu s. Open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density increase from 577 to 598 mV and 27.8 to 29.8mA/cm(2), respectively. The efficiency of solar cells increases from 11.9 to 13.4%. P gettering will be feasible to improve the efficiency of Si heterojunction solar cells fabricated on P-doped Si wafers.

AB Hybrid solar cells based on composites of silicon nanopillar arrays (SiNPs) on silicon substrates and conjugated polymer were investigated in this study. SiNPs with three dimensional (3D) geometry could orthogonalize the directions of light absorption and charge transfer while allowing for enhanced light scattering and trapping. In addition, SiNPs were fabricated by a simple process at low temperature and displayed strong light trapping capability over a wide range of incidence angles as well as near infrared light absorption. Furthermore, a method to control the density of SiNPs had been developed to obtain pillar arrays with controllable distance, which allowed conjugated polymer to reach the bottom part of SiNPs. The thickness of organic layer played a critical role on the short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage and fill factor, and optimum thickness was indispensable to achieve the superior performance. A power conversion efficiency of 9.2% was achieved based on the heterojunction with organic thin layer under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm(-2). We believe that this model is appropriate for the fabrication of heterojunction hybrid devices based on alternative organic semiconductors or even inorganic semiconducting nanocrystals.

AB The efficiency of CIGS (Copper Indium Gallium diSelenide) solar cells fabricated on stainless steel foil is lower than that on soda-lime glass substrates due to the lack of sodium incorporation and metal impurity diffusion. A dielectric barrier is necessary to prevent metal impurity diffusion for stainless steel substrates. Spin-on-glass (SOG) coatings are characterized by their lower cost and larger area than other vacuum deposition methods. By using spin coating SOG to deposit SiOx barrier layers, this study investigates the characteristics of their insulation and impurity barrier. For insulation property, a higher curing temperature is preferred. The insulation does not further improve when the curing temperature exceeds 400 degrees C. The SiOx film resistance can be as high as 10(8) Omega when the voltage is smaller than 10 V. For impurity barrier characteristics, although thick thickness is preferred, it easily incurs thermal cracking. To effectively barricade metal impurity diffusion, the influence of SiOx thickness is larger than that of curing SOG temperature. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3656330]

AB Synthesis of Si quantum dots (QDs), useful for multi-junction crystalline Si solar cells, using porous Silicon (PS) is presented in this paper. Four types of freestanding PS structures are fabricated by anodization method with modulation of current density between two levels. The level-1 current density is kept constant at 20 mA/cm(2) (for reference monolayer structure - sample A) and 10 mA/cm(2) (for all multilayer structures samples B, C, D). The level-2 is varied between 0 to 50 mA/cm(2) (0, 20, 30, 50 mA/cm(2) as sample A, B, C and D respectively). In order to obtain Si QDs from PS films, the films are subjected to sonication (120 W, 42 kHz) for 6 hours. HRTEM images confirm presence of Si nanoparticles in the range of 2 to 8 nm. Various spectroscopic analyses of Si nanoparticles are performed in order to evaluate quantum confinement behavior and surface modification observed during sonication. Analysis of de-convoluted Raman peaks shows frequency downshift and increase in full width half maximum due to formation of QDs. After sonication, PL spectroscopy indicates blue shift from 2.54 eV (sample A) to 2.85 eV (sample D_6HR), similar to the observations made by UV-Vis spectroscopy. FTIR spectra show oxidation of Si QDs during sonication. Spectroscopic and microscopic results are explained using quantum confinement and surface modification phenomenon.

AB Nanosphere lithography and antireflection coating techniques have been applied to fabricate wide-angle antireflection structures on multicrystalline silicon substrates. Self-assembled 550-nm SiO2 nanospheres were arranged periodically to act as a mask to block the inductively coupled plasma dry etching and form bulletlike nanostructures on the surface of the multicrystalline silicon wafer. Then a 65-nm-thick zinc oxide film was deposited on the nanostructures using the atomic layer deposition method. The results show that when applying the nanostructure with a ZnO film the average reflectivity of the multicrystalline silicon wafer can be decreased from 36% to 0.65% in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 850 nm for an incident angle of 8 degrees. When the incident angle reaches 60 degrees the average reflectivity of the sample becomes less than 4.6%. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society. [DOI: 10.1116/1.3666040]

AB Silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs) on a planar silicon wafer can be fabricated by a simple metal-assisted wet chemical etching method. They can offer an excellent light harvesting capability through light scattering and trapping. In this work, we demonstrated that the organic inorganic solar cell based on hybrid composites of conjugated molecules and SiNWs on a planar substrate yielded an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.70%. The high efficiency was ascribed to two aspects: one was the improvement of the light absorption by SiNWs structure on the planar components; the other was the enhancement of charge extraction efficiency, resulting from the novel top contact by forming a thin organic layer shell around the individual silicon nanowire. On the contrary, the sole planar junction solar cell only exhibited a PCE of 6.01%, due to the lower light trapping capability and the less hole extraction efficiency. It indicated that both the SiNWs structure and the thin organic layer top contact were critical to achieve a high performance organic/silicon solar cell.

AB An experimental method is developed for contact resistivity measurements of a buried interface in polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cell devices on aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) layers. The solar cell concept comprises a glass substrate covered with a temperature-stable ZnO: Al film as transparent front contact layer, a poly-Si n(+)/p(-)/p(+) cell, as well as a metal back contact. Glass/ZnO:Al/poly-Si/metal test stripe structures are fabricated by photolithographic techniques with the ZnO: Al stripes locally bared by laser ablation. The high-temperature treatments during poly-Si fabrication, e. g. a several hours lasting high-temperature step at 600 degrees C, are found to have no detrimental impact on the ZnO:Al/Si interface contact resistivity. All measured rho(C) values range well below 0.4 Omega cm(2) corresponding to a relative power loss Delta P below 3% for a solar cell with 500 mV open circuit voltage and 30 mA/cm(2) short circuit current density. By inclusion of a silicon nitride (SiNx) diffusion barrier between ZnO: Al and poly-Si the electrical material quality of the poly-Si absorber can be significantly enhanced. Even in this case, the contact resistivity remains below 0.4 Omega cm(2) if the diffusion barrier has a thickness smaller than 10 nm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of metal catalyst to prepare nanostructures on semiconductor materials has attracted much attention because of the improved device performance. In this study, we employed the intruded Au nanocluster (INC) technique to prepare highly uniform, "atomic-scale" Au nanoclusters as highly active catalysts within Si wafers. The Au nanoclusters were readily prepared through the thermal coating of a Au film on a Si wafer followed by its removal using adhesive tape. Employing the Au nanoclusters as highly active catalysts allowed us to readily and rapidly prepare, at room temperature, unique Si nanostalactite (SNS) structures of ultrahigh density and very narrow diameter (ca. 10 nm). These SNS structures possessed superior light trapping capability relative to corresponding structures prepared using electroless metal deposition or self-assembled catalytic nanoparticle methods; in addition, the etching duration was much shorter. A field emission study revealed that the SNS structures, with their much narrower diameters, required a much lower turn-on voltage relative to that of corresponding Si nanowires.

AB We report the disordered silicon (Si) subwavelength structures (SWSs), which are fabricated with the use of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching in SiCl4 gas using nickel/silicon dioxide (Ni/SiO2) nanopattens as the etch mask, on Si substrates by varying the etching parameters for broadband antireflective and self-cleaning surfaces. For the fabricated Si SWSs, the antireflection characteristics are experimentally investigated and a theoretical analysis is made based on the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. The desirable dot-like Ni nanoparticles on SiO2/Si substrates are formed by the thermal dewetting process of Ni films at 900 degrees C. The truncated cone shaped Si SWS with a high average height of 790 +/- 23 nm, which is fabricated by ICP etching with 5 sccm SiCl4 at 50 W RF power with additional 200 W ICP power under 10 mTorr process pressure, exhibits a low average reflectance of similar to 5% over a wide wavelength range of 450-1050 nm. The water contact angle of 110 degrees is obtained, indicating a hydrophobic surface. The calculated reflectance results are also reasonably consistent with the experimental data.

AB Well-aligned and closely-packed silicon nanopillar (SNP) arrays are fabricated by using a simple method with magnetron sputtering of Si on a porous anodic alumina (PAA) template at room temperature. The SNPs are formed by selective growth on the top of the PAA pore walls. The growth mechanism analysis indicates that the structure of the SNPs can be modulated by the pore spacing of the PAA and the sputtering process and is independent of the wall width of the PAA. Moreover, nanocrystals are identified by using transmission electron microscopy in the as-deposited SNP samples, which are related to the heat isolation structure of the SNPs. The Raman focus depth profile reveals a high crystallization ratio on the surface.

Nano-textured topography is successfully introduced at room temperature by evaporating Sn in a relatively high pressure. Nano-textured SnO(2) coating is obtained by annealing in air, with lateral size of nearly 1 mu m and root-mean-roughness of over 140 nm. Two structures: substrate and superstrate, are investigated to reveal the light-trapping efficiency. With only 300 nm thick Si absorber layer, the average reflectivity under AM 1.5 illumination spectrum can be limited at 14% and 7%, respectively. This technology is suitable for mass production.

AB Ion-implanted, screen-printed, high-efficiency, stable, n-base silicon solar cells fabricated from readily available 156-mm pseudosquare Czochralski wafers are described, along with prototype modules assembled from such cells. Two approaches are presented. The first approach, which involves a single phosphorus implant, has been used to produce cells (239 cm(2)) having a tight distribution of J(sc), V-oc, and fill factor over a wide range of wafer resistivity (factor of 10), with Fraunhofer-certified efficiencies up to 18.5%. In spite of the full screen-printed and alloyed Al back, a method has been developed to solder such cells in a module. The second approach, which involves implanting both phosphorus for back-surface field (BSF) and boron for front emitter, has been used to produce n-base cells having local back contacts and dielectric (SiNx/SiO2) surface passivation. Efficiencies up to 19.1%, certified by Fraunhofer, have been realized on 239-cm(2) cells. A method is also presented to express recombination activity in the cell base as a component of total reverse saturation current density. This allows recombination activity in all three regions of the cell (n(+) region and its surface, n-base, and p(+) region and its surface) to be compared as components of the total cell J(0) to aid in maximizing V-oc.

AB We present an alternative method to form a blanket and selective emitter using a method that implants ion. This avoids several problems such as losing area by laser isolation and wet process for removing phosphosilicate glass formed on silicon substrate during the conventional thermal POCl(3) diffusion process. It was demonstrated that laser isolation is not necessary after the ion implanted solar cells were fabricated. Furthermore, we also fabricated selective emitter solar cells. After studying their characteristics, it was clear that the solar cells with ion implanted selective emitter improved cell efficiency. This is because their blue response increased and their reverse saturation current density decreased. Using an industrially feasible process, solar cell efficiencies of >18.5% on 156 mm x 156 mm using a shallow 100 Omega/sq. emitter and an ion implanted 65 Omega/sq. selective emitter were achieved.

AB We report broadband antireflective disordered subwavelength structures (d-SWSs), which were fabricated on 4-inch silicon wafers by spin-coating Ag ink and metal-assisted chemical etching. The antireflection properties of the d-SWSs depend on its dimensions and heights, which were changed by the sintering temperature of the spin-coated Ag ink and etching time. The fabricated d-SWSs drastically reduced surface reflection over a wide range of wavelengths and incident angles, providing good surface uniformity. The d-SWSs with the most appropriate geometry for practical solar cell applications exhibit only 1.23% solar-weighted reflectance in the wavelength range of 300-1100 nm and average reflectance <5% up to an incident angle of 55 in the wavelength range of 300-2500 nm. This simple and low-cost nanofabrication method for antireflection could be of great importance in optical device applications because it allows mass production without any lithography processes or sophisticated equipment.

AB The transparent conducting oxide (TCO) films with low-refractive-index (low-n) are fabricated by the oblique-angle sputtering method. By using the experimentally measured physical data of the fabricated low-n TCO films as the simulation parameters, the effect of low-n TCOs on the performance of a-Si:H/mu c-Si:H tandem thin film solar cells is investigated using Silvaco ATLAS. The Al-doped zinc oxide, indium tin oxide (ITO), and Sb-doped tin oxide films are deposited at the flux incidence angles of theta(i) = 0 degrees (normal sputtering) and theta(i) = 80 degrees from the sputtering target during the sputtering process. The oblique-angle sputtered films at theta(i) = 80 degrees show the inclined columnar nanostructures compared to those at theta(i) = 0 degrees, modifying the optical properties of the films. This is caused mainly by the increase of porosity within the film which leads to its low-n characteristics. The a-Si:H/mu c-Si:H tandem thin film solar cell incorporated with the low-n ITO film exhibits an improvement in the conversion efficiency of similar to 1% under AM1.5g illumination because of its higher transmittance and lower absorption compared to that with the ITO film at theta(i) = 0 degrees indicating a conversion efficiency of 13.75%.

AB This paper proposes a novel concept for integrating ultrathin solar cells into modules. It is conceived as a method for fabricating solar panels starting from back-contact crystalline silicon solar cells. However, compared to the current state of the art in module manufacturing for back-contact solar cells, this novel concept aims at improvements in performance, reliability, and cost through the use of an alternative encapsulant, namely silicones as opposed to ethylene vinyl acetate, an alternative deposition technology, being wet coating as opposed to dry lamination; and alternative module-level metallization techniques, as opposed to cell-level tabbing-stringing or conductive foil interconnects. The process flow is proposed, and the materials and fabrication technologies are discussed. As the durability of the module, translated into the module's lifetime, is very important in the targeted application, namely solar cell modules, modeling and reliability testing results and considerations are presented to illustrate how the experimental development process may be guided by experience and theoretical derivations. Finally, feasibility is demonstrated in some first proofs of the concept, and an outlook is given pointing out the direction for further research.

DE Amorphous silicon; flexible electronics; solar cell
AB It is difficult to prepare textured surface on flexible substrate reproducibly for solar cell application. A novel method is developed that uses polyimide film to coat on a textured glass substrate as a template substrate and then peeled off as the flexible substrate. The surface morphology of the flexible substrate could faithfully reproduce the template as measured by atomic force microscopy. The hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film solar cell was fabricated on the flexible substrate successfully. The results of I-V characteristics and spectral response confirm that the efficiency of textured solar cells increases as compared to that on a flat substrate. This technology will find application in making complicated reusable substrate for flexible electronics.

AB Large-scale rationally designed periodic Si nanopillar (SiNP) arrays of varying diameters and heights have been fabricated by a top-down method. The impacts of the structural parameters (e. g., diameter/periodicity/height) on the reflectance and absorption of the SiNP array have been extensively studied, and the results are in agreement with our theoretical prediction of Li et al. Owing to the notably enhanced light absorption of the optimized SiNP array, a short-circuit current density J(sc) of 34.3 mA/cm(2) was obtained on an axial p-n SiNP array surface-textured solar cell, which is the highest to date among reported Si nanowire/SiNP-based solar cells. J(sc) is significantly boosted compared to that of the untextured solar cell (18.1 mA/cm(2)), which implies that the SiNP array is a promising texturing technology for thin-film photovoltaic application.

AB We have demonstrated that a polycrystalline silicon thin film can be fabricated in situ on soda-lime glass at 450 degrees C by an Al-induced crystallization method using electron beam evaporation. The catalytic Al is found to diffuse to the top of the crystallized Si layer and can be easily etched away by a mixture of acids. This low temperature Si crystallization process is well explained by thermodynamic consideration. Subsequent annealing at the same temperature (450 degrees C) for 6 h improves the crystallinity of the film and enlarges the average grain size to over 5 mu m. There are no observable impurity phases. The poly-Si thin films are (1 1 1) oriented and all the grains are well aligned. A defect-free and excellent crystalline structure has been revealed by transmission electron microscopy. The measured resistivity, carrier concentration and charge mobility of these as-prepared poly-Si thin films indicate that our present low temperature processing technique has great advantage and prospect for the photonics industry.

AB It is demonstrated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that P-doped silicon nanowires (Si NWs) can activate graphenes self-scrolling onto Si NWs and thus produce new kinds of graphene nanoscroll (NS)/Si core/shell heterojunctions. The simulations show that graphene sheets can fully self-scroll onto Si NWs when the Si NW radius is larger than a threshold of about 5 angstrom, forming a stable core/shell structure. It is the van der Waals force that plays a primary role in the self-scrolling process. The configuration of the graphene-Si heterojunction depends significantly on the diameter of the Si NWs. The final NS becomes multiwalled with increasing graphene length when the diameter of the Si NWs is larger than a threshold of about 6 angstrom. The zigzag NS is proved to be the most stable, while the chiral NSs are unstable and tend to evolve into zigzag NS and a model is set up to interpret the tendency from the standpoint of bond. It is demonstrated that the graphene width has no influence on the self-scrolling process at all. Compared with the conventional fabricating method, the new self-assembling one occurs at room temperature and the thickness of the NSs can be controlled accurately. Besides, the unique structure of the graphene/Si core/shell heterojunctions will significantly enhance their applications in nanoelectronic devices, hydrogen storage, solar cells, chemical or biological sensors, and energy storage in supercapacitors or batteries.

AB We have developed a method combining lithography and catalytic etching to fabricate large-area (uniform coverage overan entire 5-in, wafer) arrays of vertically aligned single. crystal 51 nanowires with high throughput. Coaxial n-Si/p-SiGe-wire arrays are also fabricated by. further coating single-crystal epitaxial SiGe layers on the Si wires using Ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHVCVD). This method allows precise control over the diameter, length, density, spacing, orientation, shape, pattern and location of Si and Si/SiGe nanowire arrays, making it possible to fabricate an array of devices based on rationally designed nanowire arrays. A proposed.. fabrication mechanism of the etching process is presented. Inspired by the excellent antireflection properties of the Si/SiGe wire arrays, we built solar cells based on the arrays of these wires containing. radial junctions, an example of which exhibits an open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 650 mV, a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 8.38 mA/cm(2), a fill factor of 0.60, and an energy conversion efficiency (eta) of 3.26%. Such a p-n radial structure will have a great potential application for cost-efficient photovoltaic (PV) solar energy conversion.

AB We report the fabrication and investigation of the parabola-shaped periodic subwavelength grating (SWG) structures on aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) film/Si substrate, which are formed by a novel re-deposition method using the AZO dot arrays as a seed layer, for broadband and omnidirectional antireflection. For fabricated parabola-shaped AZO SWG structures, the antireflection characteristics are investigated, together with theoretical analysis based on a rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. The parabola-shaped AZO SWG structure suppresses significantly Fresnel reflections compared to the AZO film and the AZO dot arrays (or cylindrical AZO SWGs with a hemispherical top) because of its linear gradient-refractive-index change between the AZO and air. For the parabola-shaped AZO SWG/initial AZO film of 600 nm after 45 min re-deposition, it exhibits a low average reflectance of similar to 5% with a solar weighted reflectance of 5.3% while maintaining a reflectance less than 25.6% over a wide wavelength region of 300-1100 nm up to the incident angle of theta(i)=70 degrees. The electrical properties of the fabricated AZO SWG structures are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the series resistance of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSC) has been studied. The series resistance of thermal annealed and un-annealed devices with different active layer thicknesses was measured. The series resistance of the organic solar cells consists of the bulk resistance of the active layer itself and the specific contact resistance between the active layer and the electrode. The bulk resistance and contact resistance were extracted from the measured series resistance using the vertical transmission line model (TLM) method. By fabricating solar cell devices with different active layer thicknesses, a relationship of the series resistance with thickness was established from which bulk and contact resistances were derived. We have also found that thermal annealing helps reduce both contact resistance and bulk resistance significantly: the contact resistance dropped by a factor of 2, while the bulk resistance decreased by a factor of 8. Results have shown that for an annealed P3HT:PCBM device that has an active layer thickness of 85 nm (optimum thickness for high efficiency), 17% of the total series resistance was due to the contact resistance, and bulk resistance contributed the rest 83%. The bulk resistance value for thermal annealed organic solar cell device with an active area of 0.1 cm(2) was found to be 150 Omega, and the measured specific contact resistance was 3.1 Omega cm(2). The measured bulk and contact resistance values are much higher as compared to the high efficiency silicon solar cells. Bulk resistance and contact resistance need to be further decreased in order to achieve higher organic solar cell efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A "bottom-up" surface texturing method based on nozzle-sprayed microspheres and spin-coated dielectric film has been proposed. The fill factor was improved by the use of indium tin oxide (ITO) as an antireflection coating (ARC) due to an increased effective area for carrier collection. The pretreatment using HCl prior to ITO deposition was found to suppress the formation of interfacial oxide at the ITO/Si junction. An enhancement in the short-wavelength response (400-600 nm) and an improvement in the short-circuit current (J(sc)) were accomplished. The difference in the efficiency (Delta eta) between the cells fabricated with ITO incorporating micro-spherical textures (MSTs) and those by KOH texturing was 13.5% at a light incident angle of 60 degrees, comparatively larger than the difference in efficiency of 7.4% observed at normal incidence. These results demonstrate the superior omnidirectional antireflection property of the ITO+MST structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire (NW) photodetector was fabricated with a simple method by bridging the gap of interdigitated gallium-doped ZnO pattern deposited on a silicon oxide (SiO2) thin film with interlaced ZnO NWs. With an incident wavelength of 375 nm, it was found that measured responsivity was 0.055 A/W for the interlaced ZnO NWs photodetector with a 1 V applied bias. The transient time constants measured during the turn-ON and turn-OFF states were tau(ON) = 12.72 ms and tau(OFF) = 447.66 ms, respectively. Furthermore, the low-frequency noise spectra obtained from the ultraviolet photodetector were purely due to the 1/f noise. Besides, the noise equivalent power and normalized detectivity (D*) of the ZnO NW photodetector were 2.32 x 10(-9) Wand 7.43 x 10(9) cm.Hz(0.5).W-1, respectively.

AB The continuity and Poisson equations are solved numerically to obtain J-V characteristics and photoconversion efficiency of a two-junction solar cell. The cell consists of a top junction comprised of nanowires with bandgap of 1.7 eV grown on a bottom junction comprised of a Si substrate. The lattice relaxation possible in nanowires permits lattice-mismatched III-V material growth on Si, thereby achieving the optimum bandgaps in a two-junction cell. The model indicates a limiting efficiency of 42.3% under a concentration of 500 Suns (AM1.5 D spectrum). This limiting efficiency is similar to that calculated for the planar lattice-matched triple-junction Ge/InGaAs/InGaP cell. Methods of fabricating the nanowire/Si cell are discussed including requirements for nanowire sidewall surface passivation. The model indicated that passivation of the nanowire sidewall surfaces that produces a surface recombination velocity of 3000 cm.s(-1) and surface trap density of 10(12) cm(-2) should be sufficient to yield high efficiency solar cells.

AB The graphene (Gr)/Si electrodes were fabricated by electrophoresis method and then following an annealing process. The p-Si surface was found to be covered completely with successive and transparent Gr sheets, and thus the impairment of aqueous solution on the photoelectrochemical capability of silicon could be avoided. This annealing process was a key process for improving the adhesion of Gr/Si interface. After annealing at 400 degrees C, the Gr/Si electrodes displayed high photoresponse ability and high stability in aqueous solution. The carriers transfer between Gr and Si is discussed on the basis of the semiconductor energy band theory. The results demonstrated that the Gr/Si electrodes would be a promising candidate as solar energy materials using in aqueous solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films with relatively high transparency and low absorption are prepared by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method and their effect on the device performance of a-Si:H/mu cSi:H tandem thin film solar cells is theoretically investigated by applying the experimentally measured physical data of the fabricated films to the simulation parameters. The GLAD of ITO produces inclined porous columnar nanostructures due to the atomic shadowing effect. With increasing the incident flux angle, the columns are increasingly inclined, thus resulting in the improved transmission property as well as the decrease of the refractive index and extinction coefficient because of enhanced porosity within the film. Furthermore, the antireflection characteristics are improved over a wide wavelength range of 300-1100 nm. For a-Si:H/mu cSi:H tandem thin film solar cell structure incorporated with the 0 degrees ITO/80 degrees ITO bi-layer structure, the conversion efficiency (eta) of 13.6% is obtained from simulation under AM1.5g illumination, indicating an efficiency improvement compared to the device with the 0 degrees ITO/0 degrees ITO bi-layer structure (i.e. eta = 12.58%).

AB Silicon nanowire (Si NW) arrays were fabricated on polished and pyramids textured mono-crystalline Si (mc-Si) using an aqueous chemical etching method. The Si NWs and a hybrid texture of NWs and pyramids both show strong anti-reflectance properties in the wavelength region of 300-1000 nm, with the minimum average reflectance of 2.52% and 8%, respectively. The above two nanostructures were fabricated on mc-Si solar cells with the area of 125 x 125 mm(2). Then the influences of Si NWs and hybrid textures on the performances of mc-Si solar cells created using different fabrication processes were analyzed by internal quantum efficiency measurement and by systematical comparisons of efficiency, filling factor, open circuit voltage and short-circuit current. Passivation is found to be essential for the hybrid textured solar cells, and the average open circuit voltage can be improved by 7% after a passivation layer was deposited. The short circuit current could be increased when Si NWs were fabricated on a substrate with an initial PN junction. (C) 2011 American Vacuum Society. [DOI: 10.1116/1.3591344]

AB An ink-jet method for fabrication of fine and smooth front side highly conductive silver lines on crystalline Silicon substrate is described. The fabricated conductive silver lines on different substrates are characterized by means optical microscope, optical profilometers, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and electrical measurements. The coffee-ring effect is controlled by increasing the solid loading of the ink from 20W% to 40W% and printing at optimum substrate temperature (90-100 degrees C) and optimum printing parameters. Smooth printed conductive silver lines, with line thickness ranges from 0.8 similar to 0.91 mu m for single pass, are obtained. When increased substrate temperature, a significant reduction of spreading of ink was observed. And conductive silver lines obtained at optimum substrate temperature (90-100 degrees C), free of periodic wrinkles and line bleeding, are produced. The influence of annealing temperature on line resistance, the morphology and functionality of the printed conductive silver lines is optically and electrically analyzed. To deposit thicker lines multiple passes of ink-jet printing were done on polished single crystalline silicon (sc-Si) and standard alkaline (NaOH) textured n(+)/p single crystalline silicon (n(+)/p sc-Si). Moreover, the printed conductive silver lines are characterized optically and electrically. And, promising results in terms of printed line thickness and electrical property are achieved.

AB In this paper, screen-printing laser grooved buried contact (LGBC) method was applied, which is compatible with the existing screen-printed solar cell equipment and facilities. Experiments were performed in order to optimize short circuit current (I(sc)), open circuit voltage (V(oc)) and fill factor of high efficiency solar cells. To enhance I(sc), V(oc), and efficiency, heavy doping was performed at low sheet resistance in the laser grooved region of the cell. In contrast, light doping was carried out at a high sheet resistance in the non-laser grooved region. To increase fill factor, porous silicon found on the wafer after dipping in an HF solution to remove SiN(x), was cleared. The fabricated screen-printing LGBC solar cell using a 125 mm x 125 mm single crystalline silicon wafer exhibited an efficiency of 17.2%. The results show that screen-printing LGBC method can be applied for high efficiency solar cells.

AB A new two-step growth method was proposed to fabricate microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) thin films by an electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ECR-PECVD). An ultra thin Si film was first deposited and followed by H(2) plasma treatment for few minutes, and then the mu c-Si:H film was deposited on it. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and Raman spectrometer were used to study the microstructures and the crystalline volume fraction of mu c-Si:H films. The HRTEM results show that the amorphous silicon thin film with a thickness of 15 nm can be crystallized by H(2) plasma treatment in 2 min, and then it serves as the seed layer for the subsequent growth of mu c-Si:H films. By optimizing the deposition parameters, the mu c-Si:H film without amorphous incubation layer can be fabricated by this new two-step method and a proper crystalline volume fraction of 50.6% can be obtained.

AB ZnS and ZnS-MgF(2) composite films were prepared on soda-lime glass substrates and MgF(2) films on GaAs by rf magnetron sputtering to investigate multi-layer antireflection (AR) coatings. Optical constants of these films were determined by envelope method and spectroscopic ellipsometry. In particular, ZnS-MgF(2) composite films were fabricated by co-sputtering of ZnS and MgF(2) target to obtain intermediate refractive index material for a middle layer in the triple-layer AR coating and these films exhibited the desired intermediate refractive index. Based on the extracted optical constants, single-, double- and triple-layer AR coatings on GaAs substrates were designed and fabricated by rf magnetron sputtering. Low reflectance could be obtained from single-layer AR coating only at a specific wavelength and could be obtained from multi-layer AR coating at wide wavelength regime. Additionally, incident angle dependence of the reflectance of the multi-layer AR coatings was also investigated and showed different behavior according to a number of layers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The hierarchical structures are fabricated by creating.. nanopillars on the microscale round protrusion arrays, which are similar to natural mosquito eyes consisting of combined micro- and nanostructures. The hierarchical arrays dramatically suppress the surface reflection from visible to near-infrared regions with an angle of incidence of up to 70 degrees.

AB In this paper, we report on the synthesis of silicon quantum dots for photovoltaic applications by means of ion implantation followed by annealing. Nucleation was achieved by implanting Si+ ions into SiO2 thin films, previously thermally grown on a Si(100) substrate, and annealing to 1100 degrees C. Passivation was used for photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The thickness of the oxide layer, the stoichiometry of the implanted layer, and the depth profiles of the implanted ions were determined for all samples by both Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) and ellipsometry techniques. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the diameter of the silicon quantum dots (Si-QDs) varies from 2 to 4 nm, which is less than the Bohr radius of bulk crystalline Si(similar to 5 nm). Optical and electrical properties have been investigated by PL and I-V measurements. When passivated silicon nanocrystals (Si-nc) embedded into SiO2 are excited using a 450 nm diode laser, they exhibit a strong PL emission in the range of 650-1000 nm. Based on these investigations, p-type Si-QDs/n-type c-Si junctions were fabricated and electrically characterized in the dark as well as under an AM1.5G terrestrial solar spectrum for nonimplanted, as-implanted, and implanted-annealed samples for different implantation fluences. The electrical curves of the structures under illumination demonstrate the photovoltaic behavior of the Si-QDs. Despite the weak light conversion of these devices, these results remain very promising and offer potentially unprecedented, vast improvements to third generation solar cells.

AB A two-step growth method was proposed to reduce the amorphous incubation layer in the initial growth of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) films prepared by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD). In the two-step growth process, a thin seed layer was first grown on the glass substrate under high hydrogen dilution ratios (phi >= 0.9), and then a thick overlayer was subsequently deposited upon the seed layer at a lower phi value. The effect of various deposition parameters on the structural properties of poly-Si films was investigated by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, the electrical properties, such as dark and photo conductivities, of poly-Si films were also measured. It was found that the Si incubation layer could be suppressed greatly in the initial growth of poly-Si with the two-step growth method. In the subsequent poly-Si film thickening, a lower phi value of the reactant gases can be applied to enhance the deposition rate. Therefore, a high-quality poly-Si film can be fabricated via a two-step growth method with a sufficient growth rate using HWCVD. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vertically aligned silicon nanowire (Si NW) arrays have been fabricated over large areas using an electroless etching (EE) method, which involves etching of silicon wafers in a silver nitrate and hydrofluoric acid based solution. A detailed parametric study determining the relationship between nanowire morphology and time, temperature, solution concentration and starting wafer characteristics (doping type, resistivity, crystallographic orientation) is presented. The as-fabricated Si NW arrays were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a linear dependency of nanowire length to both temperature and time was obtained and the change in the growth rate of Si NWs at increased etching durations was shown. Furthermore, the effects of EE parameters on the optical reflectivity of the Si NWs were investigated in this study. Reflectivity measurements show that the 42.8% reflectivity of the starting silicon wafer drops to 1.3%, recorded for 10 mu m long Si NW arrays. The remarkable decrease in optical reflectivity indicates that Si NWs have a great potential to be utilized in radial or coaxial p-n heterojunction solar cells that could provide orthogonal photon absorption and enhanced carrier collection.

AB Thin films composed of Ge nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous SiO(2) matrix (Ge-NC TFs) were prepared using a low temperature in situ growth method. Unexpected high p-type conductivity was observed in the intrinsic Ge-NC TFs. Unintentional doping from shallow dopants was excluded as a candidate mechanism of hole generation. Instead, the p-type characteristic was attributed to surface state induced hole accumulation in NCs, and the hole conduction was found to be a thermally activated process involving charge hopping from one NC to its nearest neighbor. Theoretical analysis has shown that the density of surface states in Ge-NCs is sufficient to induce adequate holes for measured conductivity. The film conductivity can be improved significantly by post-growth rapid thermal annealing and this effect is explained by a simple thermodynamic model. The impact of impurities on the conduction properties was also studied. Neither compensation nor enhancement in conduction was observed in the Sb- and Ga-doped Ge-NC TFs, respectively. This could be attributed to the fact that these impurities are no longer shallow dopants in NCs and are much less likely to be effectively activated. Finally, the photovoltaic effect of heterojunction diodes employing such Ge-NC TFs was characterized in order to demonstrate its functionality in device implementation.

AB ZnO tetrapods and rods were grown on silicon and thermally oxidized porous silicon substrates with and without Au catalyst layer by carbothermal reduction of ZnO powder through chemical vapor transport and condensation method (CVTC). Porous silicon was fabricated by electrochemical etching of silicon in HF solution. The effect of substrates on morphology, structure and photoluminescence spectra of ZnO nanostructures has been studied. The texture coefficient (TC) of each sample was calculated from XRD data that demonstrated random orientation of ZnO nanostructures on the oxidized porous silicon substrate. Moreover, TC indicates the effect of Au catalyst layer on formation of more highly oriented ZnO nanorods. The morphology of the samples was investigated by SEM which confirms formation of ZnO nanostructures on oxidized porous silicon substrates with and without catalyst. A blue-green emission has been observed in ZnO nanostructures grown on Si and the oxidized PS substrates without Au catalyst layer by PL measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the antireflective property of thin film amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell structures based on graded refractive index structure together with theoretical analysis. Optimizations of the index profile are performed using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. The graded refractive index structure fabricated by oblique angle deposition suppresses optical reflection over a wide range of wavelength and incident angle, compared to the conventional structure. The average reflectance of thin film a-Si solar cell structure with the graded refractive index structure is suppressed by 54% at normal incidence due to the effective refractive index matching between ITO and a-Si, indicating a reasonable agreement with calculated results.

AB Cu-based ternary chalcogenides have received great interest as low-cost alternatives to conventional photovoltaic materials.. In this work, a large quantity of single-crystalline, orthorhombic phase Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons are fabricated using a facile solvothermal method. The growth of the Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons is revealed to be a layer-by-layer stacking of Cu4Bi4S9 thin slabs via dodecylamine (DDA) linker, in which the number of stacking layers, and, subsequently, the width-to-thickness ratio, depends on the DDA concentration. Optical investigations show that the as-prepared Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons have a narrow bandgap of E-g = 1.14 eV and enhanced surface photovoltage response in the entire visible wavelength range. It is indicated that these Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons have potential application in photodetectors, solar cells, or other optoelectronic devices.

AB An anti-reflection (AR) moth-eye structure made of acrylic resin and deposited on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate was optimized in the wavelength range from 400 to 1170 nm; crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells function efficiently in this wavelength range. The rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method was used for optical simulation, and the Taguchi method was used for efficient optimization. The simulation results showed that the reflectance of the optimized structure over the above-mentioned wavelength range was less than 0.87% and that a minimal reflectance of 0.1% was observed at 400 nm. Experimental results showed that the reflectance of a fabricated moth-eye structure was less than 1.0% in the wavelength range and that a minimal reflectance of 0.55% was observed at 700 nm. A c-Si solar cell, which was enclosed in a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) layer of uniform thickness, was coated with the fabricated moth-eye film, and it was observed that the moth-eye film increased electric generation (EG) up to 15%, depending on the incident angle. Further, a daily increase in EG of up to 8.7% was estimated on a clear summer day in Japan when the moth-eye film was used. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This article analyses silicon quantum dots based materials which could be used in all-silicon tandem solar cells. The contact properties of aluminium and nickel on this material are obtained by circular transmission line measurements (TLM). Both metals make ohmic contacts with the material and the contact resistance is also similar for both metals, indicating that either the material is very heavily doped or the surface defect density is very high. Doping by diffusion is demonstrated for the first time on this material and a MOS structure is fabricated in order to extract doping type, doping concentration and mobility. A simple model is established for the MOS structure. Using capacitance versus voltage (C V) measurements, we are able to extract doping concentration, mobility and surface charge by curve fitting. Using this fitting method, the relative permittivity of our material is estimated and an effective gate contact area is calculated for different frequencies, doping types and gate voltages. The doping concentration extracted is in the order of 10(17)cm(-3) and the mobility is two to three orders of magnitude lower compared to that of crystalline silicon with a similar doping level. Based on the C-V curves we can demonstrate that B behaves like a p-type dopant and P as an n-type dopant in our material. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim
