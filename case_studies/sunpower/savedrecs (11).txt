AB Chemical vapor deposition-based sulfur passivation using hydrogen sulfide is carried out on both n-type and p-type Si(100) wafers. Al contacts are fabricated on sulfur-passivated Si(100) wafers and the resultant Schottky barriers are characterized with current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V) and activation-energy methods. Al/S-passivated n-type Si(100) junctions exhibit ohmic behavior with a barrier height of < 0.078 eV by the I-V method and significantly lower than 0.08 eV by the activation-energy method. For Al/S-passivated p-type Si(100) junctions, the barrier height is 0.77 eV by I-V and activation-energy methods and 1.14 eV by the C-V method. The discrepancy between C-V and other methods is explained by image force-induced barrier lowering and edge-leakage current. The I-V behavior of an Al/S-passivated p-type Si(100) junction remains largely unchanged after 300 A degrees C annealing in air. It is also discovered that heating the S-passivated Si(100) wafer before Al deposition significantly improves the thermal stability of an Al/S-passivated n-type Si(100) junction to 500 A degrees C.

AB We report for the first time the preparation of Yb3+-Er3+ co-doped beta-phase sodium gadolinium fluoride (NaGdF4:Yb/Er) microcrystals using citric acid (CA) as a shape modifier and the application of NaGdF4:Yb/Er to amorphous silicon solar cells. The proposed hydrothermal method was facile and eco-friendly. It was found that CA played a critical role in the shape evolution of the final products. The related synthesis mechanisms are discussed. Under 980 nm laser excitation, the optimized NaGdF4:Yb/Er crystals exhibited strong upconversion (UC) emissions at visible wavelengths. Amorphous silicon thin film solar cells were designed and fabricated for investigating different UC configurations. In combination with a metallic back reflector, the cell with the front side UC layer achieved a six-fold improvement of the photocurrent while the cell with the rear side UC layer exhibited a ten-fold enhancement of the photocurrent, under 980 nm light, compared with the cell without upconverter.

AB Nanostructured silicon surfaces like black-silicon (b-Si) are of great interest in current sensor technology. This paper presents an alternative method to fabricate b-Si in poly-silicon thin film prepared on pre-deposited insulation layer in order to open new door to the integration of silicon nanograss in biosensor application as sensing or seed layer. In our experiment, black poly-silicon (BPS) is formed in LPCVD deposited poly-silicon thin film by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) at cryogenic temperature in SF6 + O-2 plasma. Etching parameters like temperature, O-2 flow and RF power is varied and morphology of the resultant thin film is analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The fabricated samples are subjected to a comparative investigation, which contained pillar density, directionality, etch rate and loading effects. The effect of the grain size of poly-silicon layer is analyzed and compared to samples micromachined in single-crystalline silicon (c-Si). We found that fabrication parameters of BPS morphology significantly differ from that of conventional b-Si realized in c-Si substrate. A simple application example of our BPS layer for increasing specific surface area of potential sensors is also demonstrated. As far as we know, this is the first demonstration and systematic study of b-Si fabrication in poly-silicon thin film. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photolithography is used as an alternative method to overcome the challenge of making anode and cathode contacts on a Si nanocrystal solar cell deposited on non-conductive substrates instead of reactive ion etching (RIE). The advantages of this method include better control of isolation mesa fabrication and the avoidance of device exposure to highly energetic particles which may cause unpredictable damage. The photovoltaic device fabricated shows an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 270 mV and 0.124 mA/cm(2) respectively at room temperature under one-sun illumination. Current-voltage measurements were performed at temperatures (T) from 77 K to 300 K. A model that includes recombination-generation current in the depletion region is considered to explain the observed current behaviour of the device. An ideality factor very close to 2 was calculated based on Suns-V-oc measurement, which indicates that the device is limited by recombination in the depletion region. A discrepancy was observed between the peaks (1.47 eV) in the photoluminescence spectrum and maximum V-oc (0.81 V) extrapolated from the V-oc-T relation at 0 K. This discrepancy has been attributed to the temperature dependence of the carrier lifetime in the depletion region characterized by an activation energy later defined in this article.

AB The purpose of this study is to reduce textured crystalline silicon (TCS) substrate surface-reflectivity over a wide spectral range (300-1100 nm), to improve the step coverage of the textured structure, and to shift the minimal value of reflection from the unabsorbed region to the absorbed region. The TCS solar-cell interface between air and silicon was added to a SiOx/SiOxNy/SiNx triple-layer anti-reflective coatings (TLARCs) structure using the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) growth method. This paper presents theoretical and practical discussions, as well as the experimental results of fabricating the films and devices. The average reflection of the SiOx/SiOxNy/SiNx TLARs reduced to 2.01% (300-1100 nm). The minimal value of reflection was shifted from 1370 nm (unabsorbed region) to 968 nm (absorbed region). The SEM images show effective step coverage. In comparison to the untreated TCS solar cells, applying the experimental SiOx/SiOxNy/SiNx TLARCs to conventional TCS solar cells improved the short-circuit current density (J(sc)) by 7.78%, and solar-cell efficiency by 10.95%. This study demonstrates that the SiOx/SiOxNy/SiNx TLARCs structure provides antireflective properties over a broad range of visible and near-infrared light wavelengths. An effective step coverage and minimal value of reflection from unabsorbed region shift to the absorbed region is demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Copper-rich interfacial-layer (Cu-rich IL) is formed during sputter deposition of cupric oxide (CuO) layer on silicon (Si). It has significant impact on the performance of p-CuO/n-Si heterojunction solar cells. In this report, CuO films deposited on Si at different RF-power levels using single and two-step RF-sputtering techniques and p-CuO/n-Si heterojunction solar cells have been investigated. Systematic characterization using XPS, AFM, XRD, Raman, and HR-TEM reveal that two-step RF-sputtering technique offers better crystal quality CuO film with thinner Cu-rich IL layer. Photovoltaic (PV) properties with an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 421 mV, short circuit current (J(sc)) of 4.5 mA/cm(2), and a photocurrent of 8.3 mA/cm(2) have been achieved for the cells prepared using two-step sputtering method, which are significantly higher than that for the solar cells fabricated using a single-step sputtering. The PV properties were further improved by depositing CuO films at higher working pressure with nitrogen doping. The efficiency of the best device achieved is approximately 1.21%, which is the highest value reported for p-CuO/n-Si heterojunction based solar cells. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Transfer printing is a method to transfer solid micro/nanoscale materials (herein called 'inks') from a substrate where they are generated to a different substrate by utilizing elastomeric stamps. Transfer printing enables the integration of heterogeneous materials to fabricate unexampled structures or functional systems that are found in recent advanced devices such as flexible and stretchable solar cells and LED arrays. While transfer printing exhibits unique features in material assembly capability, the use of adhesive layers or the surface modification such as deposition of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on substrates for enhancing printing processes hinders its wide adaptation in microassembly of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) structures and devices. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed an advanced mode of transfer printing which deterministically assembles individual microscale objects solely through controlling surface contact area without any surface alteration. The absence of an adhesive layer or other modification and the subsequent material bonding processes ensure not only mechanical bonding, but also thermal and electrical connection between assembled materials, which further opens various applications in adaptation in building unusual MEMS devices.

AB Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensively studied since their discovery in 1991. DSSCs have been extensively researched over the past decades as cheaper alternatives to silicon solar cells due to their high energy-conversion efficiency and their low production cost. However, some problems need to be solved in order to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs. In particular, the electron recombination that occurs due to the contact between the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and a redox electrolyte is one of the main limiting factors of efficiency. In this work, we report for the first time the improvement of the photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs by doping TiO2 with Al2O3. DSSCs were constructed using composite particles of Al2O3-doped TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles. The DSSCs using Al2O3 showed the maximum conversion efficiency of 6.29% due to effective electron transport. DSSCs based on Al2O3-doped TiO2 films showed better photovoltaic performance than cells fabricated with only TiO2 nanoparticles. This result is attributed to the prevention of electron recombination between electrons in the TiO2 conduction band with holes in the dye or the electrolyte. There mechanism is suggested based on impedance results, which indicated improved electron transport at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.

AB Boron doped hydrogenated multiphase silicon-carbon (multiphase silicon-carbon) film has been grown by a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) method to obtain the properties of high conductivity and a low absorption coefficient. It consists of amorphous carbon, amorphous silicon and a crystalline silicon-like clustering phase. It has the advantage of reducing optical loss due to the wider band gap of amorphous carbon compared to amorphous silicon carbide. The film was fabricated in conditions of low power density with a high hydrogen flow rate to increase the ratio of the amorphous carbon. This result is able to be achieved because the reaction of Si-based and C-based radicals is suppressed by the deposition condition of low electron temperature (TO of the plasma and the short residence time of the gases. The multiphase silicon-carbon showed high electrical conductivity and a low optical absorption coefficient in the short wavelength region. Applying it for use as a front contact layer in a Si thin film solar cell, it showed an improvement in the conversion efficiency due to the increase in the quantum efficiency in the short wavelength region.

AB We report on the computational design, fabrication and validation of a multi-layer silicon based thin film solar cell. The cell structure consists of a thin absorber layer of amorphous silicon deposited on a back-reflector aluminum layer and coated on top with ITO transparent conductive oxide. The structure is mounted on a glass substrate. We first use constrained optimization techniques along with numerical solvers of the electromagnetic equations (i.e. FDTD) to tune the geometry of the design. The resulting structure suggests that photon absorptivity in the thin film silicon can be enhanced by as much as 100% over the uncoated layer. The proposed design is then fabricated using thin film deposition techniques, along with a control sample of bare silicon absorber for comparison. AFM imaging and spectrophotometry experiments are applied to image and record the surface roughness and measure the reflectivity spectrum of the sample. Using the measured reflectivity spectrum, we then use inverse optimization to estimate the realized thin film dimensions, deposition error and unwanted oxidation volume. At the end, we use a statistical Monte Carlo analysis as a second method of verification to demonstrate that the measured spectra are in accordance with the expected curves from simulation, and to estimate the effects of fabrication error.

AB A novel method for preparing a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) with fluorescent aqueous layer sandwiched between two pieces of flat glass is developed. By this method, an aqueous layer concentrator with a size of 78 x 78 x 7 (mm) is fabricated. After coupled with silicon solar cell, the concentrator shows a power conversion efficiency of 3.9%, about 30% higher than that of the same sized laminated glass concentrator employing the same dyes. Furthermore, the measured efficiency almost reaches the calculated limit of the aqueous layer LSC. This kind of aqueous layer LSC offers a potential application in the building-integrated photovoltaics.

AB Screen printing is a useful method for fabricating electrodes or signal wires of electronic devices. However, finer patterns, e.g., 50-mu m-wide, are difficult to form. Herein, we introduce a newly developed printing technique called "screen-offset printing," as a candidate method for solving this problem. In this process, first, ink patterns are screen-printed on a silicone-resin blanket; they are then transferred from the blanket to an object. In the present study, we analyze the features of screen-offset printing by observing printed conductive patterns, and elucidate the impact of this method by compating the experimental results of screen-offset printing and conventional screen printing. In addition, we demonstrate the fabrication of fine patterns with a line and space (LIS) of 50/50 and 30/30 mu m. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inverted pyramids and v-groove texturing has been employed for high efficiency cells because they provide advantages over the conventional upright random pyramid texturing used industrially. This letter reports the use of an inkjet-patterning technique as an alternative to the expensive and complex photolithography method normally used for the dielectric patterning step required for the fabrication of these light trapping structures. The resulting single-sided and double-sided inkjet-patterned textures are equivalent in structure to matching textures produced using photolithography and they show enhanced cell absorption over random upright pyramid texturing in the near-bandgap wavelength range. Photocurrent calculations show that the inkjet-patterning approach is a promising direction for current commercial wafers of about 200 mu m thickness although future inkjet technology improvements will need to reduce pattern feature dimensions to reduce the extent of silicon etching for compatibility with the predicted thinner wafers in the future.

AB Film properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) fabricated by "liquid-Si printing" (LSP) were investigated in detail and compared to the conventional plasma enhanced chemical deposition (plasma-CVD) method. LSP a-Si: H films (LSP films) had lower film density and larger size void than the a-Si: H films deposited by plasma-CVD (CVD films). On the other hand, the LSP films had high photoconductivity comparable to device grade a-Si: H films and higher photostability than the CVD films. Thus, the LSP films were drastically different from conventional CVD films. The conversion efficiency of the bifacial solar cells (glass/TCO/n(LSP film)/i(LSP film)/p(CVD film)/TCO/electrode), which was a problem because of the missing link between high photoconductivity and low cell performance, were improved. Undoped CVD film was inserted between the i- and p-layers to suppress the plasma damage to the active layer printed by LSP when depositing a B doped a-Si: H by plasma-CVD. As a result, we achieved conversion efficiencies of 1.1% with n side incidence and 3.1% with p side incidence.

AB A moth-eye pattern made of silica (SiO2) nanoparticles mixed with MIBK (methyl isobutyl ketone) was fabricated on a glass substrate using a direct printing method. The patterned glass was annealed to improve hardness and a heptdecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl trichloro-silane based self-assembled monolayer (HDFS-SAM) was applied to the moth-eye pattern to reduce surface energy which improves hydrophobic properties. Compared to flat glass, the moth-eye patterned glass with a HDFS-SAM coating showed reduced reflectance, strong hardness, and high efficiency. As a result, the J(SC) of photovoltaic module was increased up to 1.9755 mA/cm(2) and efficiency was improved by 4.66% by the increased current density (J(sc)) of photovoltaic system, and the external quantum efficiency was enhanced over the entire visible spectrum.

AB Photoelectrochemical (PEG) water splitting to produce H-2 is a renewable method for addressing the worldwide energy consumption increasing and fossil fuels storage shrinking. In order to achieve sustainable PEC H-2 production, the semiconductor electrodes should have good photo-absorption ability, proper band positions, and chemical stability in aqueous condition. Different from the large-band-gap semiconductors such as TiO2, which can work efficiently under UV light, Si is an narrow-band-gap semiconductor that can efficiently absorb visible light; however, Si is indirect semiconductor and susceptible to photocorrosion in aqueous solution. In this paper, we demonstrate a new strategy of first protecting and then activating to develop a stable visible light photoanode for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. This AgNPs/PEDOT/SiNW arrays show an encouraging solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of 2.86 % and a pronounced incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) across the whole visible region. Our strategy proposed here contributes to further improvement of corrosion protection and solar energy harvesting for narrow-band-gap semiconductors that employed in visible light photoelectrochemical and photoelectric conversion applications.

AB Inspired by nature, a number of techniques have been developed to fabricate the bionic structures of lotus leaves and moth eyes in order to realize the extraordinary functions of self-cleaning and antireflection. Compared with the existing technologies, we present a straightforward method to fabricate well-defined micro and nano artificial bio-structures in this work. The proposed method of direct laser interference nanomanufacturing (DLIN) takes a significant advantage of high efficiency as only a single technological procedure is needed without pretreatment, mask, and pattern transfer processes. Meanwhile, the corresponding structures show both antireflection and superhydrophobicity properties simultaneously. The developed four-beam nanosecond laser interference system configuring the TE-TE-TE-TE and TE-TE-TE-TM polarization modes was set up to generate periodic micro cone and hole structures with a huge number of nano features on the surface. The theoretical and experimental results have shown that the periodic microcone structure exhibits excellent properties with both a high contact angle (CA = 156.3 degrees) and low omnidirectional reflectance (5.9-15.4%). Thus, DLIN is a novel and promising method suitable for mass production of self-cleaning and antireflection surface structures. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) is the most effective method for the fabrication of antireflection (AR) films. Interface reflection is one of the challenges in AR film fabrication. To apply the fabricated AR film to any surfaces, an adhesive material is needed. However, owing to the difference in refractive index between the AR film and the adhesive material, interface reflection still occurs. Therefore, an AR film that can prevent the reflection at its front and back surfaces was studied. Thus, we proposed the fabrication of a double-sided self-supporting antireflection-structured (DSARS) film. As a result, the reflectivity of the fabricated DSARS film is 0.1% at visible light wavelengths. The DSARS film also suppresses the adhesive interface reflection.

AB A method has been developed to fabricate organic-inorganic hybrid heterojunction solar cells based on n-type silicon nanowire (SiNW) and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hybrid structures by evacuating the PEDOT: PSS solution with dip-dropping on the top of SiNWs before spin-coating (solution-evacuating). The coverage and contact interface between PEDOT:PSS and SiNW arrays can be dramatically enhanced by optimizing the solution-evacuated time. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaches 9.22% for a solution-evacuated time of 2 min compared with 5.17% for the untreated pristine device. The improvement photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to better organic coverage and contact with an n-type SiNW surface. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America

AB The characteristics of nip-type alpha-Si:H thin film solar cells based on DNA-CTMA biopolymer was investigated. The DNA-CTMA was used as the buffer layer in nip-type a-Si:H solar cell. The E-opt of the DNA-CTMA biopolymer was measured with UV-VIS spectrometer. The E-opt of DNA-CTMA was determined as 3.96 eV by the plot of (Ahv)(2) versus h.. All films of amorphous materials were deposited by PECVD method. The solar cell with a simple structure of glass/ITO/n-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H/DNA-CTMA/Al was fabricated. The various values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and conversion efficiency. were measured under 100 mW/cm(2) (AM 1.5) solar simulator irradiation. Consequently, the resulting in solar cell showed an enhancement in conversion efficiency eta compared to conventional nip-type a-Si:H solar cell without buffer layer of DNA-CTMA biopolymer.

AB Vertically orientated single crystalline silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays with controlled diameters are fabricated via a metal-assisted chemical etching method. The diameter of the fabricated nanowires is controlled by simply varying the etching time in HF/H2O2 electrolytes. The fabricated SiNWs have diameters ranging from 117 to 650 nm and lengths from 8 to 18 mu m. The optical measurements showed a significant difference in the reflectance/absorption of the SiNWs with different diameters, where the reflectance increases with increasing the diameter of the SiNWs. The SiNWs showed significant photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra with peaks lying between 380 and 670 nm. The PL intensity increases as the diameter increases and shows red shift for peaks at similar to 670 nm. The increase or decrease of reflectivity is coincident with PL intensity at wavelength similar to 660 nm. The x-ray diffraction patterns confirm the high crystallinity of the fabricated SiNWs. In addition, the Raman spectra showed a shift in the first order transverse band toward lower frequencies compared to that usually seen for c-Si. Finite difference time domain simulations have been performed to confirm the effect of change of diameter on the optical properties of the nanowires. The simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental results for the SiNWs of different diameters. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB We have fabricated approximately 0.5-mu m-thick undoped n-BaSi2 epitaxial films with various average grain areas ranging from 2.6 to 23.3 mu m(2) on Si(111) by molecular beam epitaxy, and investigated their minority-carrier lifetime properties by the microwave-detected photoconductivity decay method at room temperature. The measured excess-carrier decay curves were divided into three parts in terms of decay rate. We characterized the BaSi2 films using the decay time of the second decay mode, tau(SRH), caused by Shockley-Read-Hall recombination without the carrier trapping effect, as a measure of the minority-carrier properties in the BaSi2 films. The measured sSRH was grouped into two, independently of the average grain area of BaSi2. BaSi2 films with cloudy surfaces or capped intentionally with a 3 nm Ba or Si layer, showed large tau(SRH) (ca. 8 mu s), whereas those with mirror surfaces much smaller tau(SRH) (ca. 0.4 mu s). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed to discuss the surface region of the BaSi2 films. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Highly mesoporous titanium carbide (TiC) based composites were synthesized through a simple carbothermal reduction of homogenous monoliths which were prepared by a one-pot sal-gel process. Their application properties as a counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) were evaluated in this paper. The surface area (116-368 m(2)/g), average particles size (14-87 nm) and pore size (4-9.2 nm) of the mesoporous composites can be easily tuned by altering chemical compositions of the precursor. Introduction of silicon into the Ti-C-O system significantly reduced the average carbide grain size and also enhanced the mesoporousity of TiC composites. The dye-sensitized solar cell using a PEDOT:PSS doped TiC-SiC-C composite as the counter electrode showed a notable efficiency of 5.7%, which doubled that of pure PEDOT:PSS cell. Potentially, the reported method could be a convenient route to fabricate porous TiC based composites for other functional applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Directed self-assembly of block copolymer polystyrene-b-polyethylene oxide (PS-b-PEO) thin film was achieved by a one-pot methodology of solvent vapor assisted nanoimprint lithography (SAIL). Simultaneous solvent-anneal and imprinting of a PS-b-PEO thin film on silicon without surface pre-treatments yielded a 250 nm line grating decorated with 20 nm diameter nanodots array over a large surface area of up to 4' wafer scale. The grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering diffraction pattern showed the fidelity of the NIL stamp pattern replication and confirmed the periodicity of the BCP of 40 nm. The order of the hexagonally arranged nanodot lattice was quantified by SEM image analysis using the opposite partner method and compared to conventionally solvent-annealed block copolymer films. The imprint-based SAIL methodology thus demonstrated an improvement in ordering of the nanodot lattice of up to 50%, and allows significant time and cost reduction in the processing of these structures.

AB Vertically aligned silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays have been fabricated over a large area using a silver-assisted single-step electroless wet chemical etching (EWCE) method, which involves the etching of silicon wafers in aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. A comprehensive systematic investigation on the influence of different parameters, such as the etching time ( up to 15 h), solution temperature (10-80 degrees C), AgNO3 (5-200 mM) and HF ( 2-22 M) concentrations, and properties of the multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers, is presented to establish a relationship of these parameters with the SiNW morphology. A linear dependence of the NW length on the etch time is obtained even at higher temperature (10-50 degrees C). The activation energy for the formation of SiNWs on Si( 100) has been found to be equal to similar to 0:51 eV. It has been shown for the first time that the surface area of the Si wafer exposed to the etching solution is an important parameter in determining the etching kinetics in the single-step process. Our results establish that single-step EWCE offers a wide range of parameters by means of which high quality vertical SiNWs can be produced in a very simple and controlled manner. A mechanism for explaining the influence of various parameters on the evolution of the NW structure is discussed. Furthermore, the SiNW arrays have extremely low reflectance ( as low as <3% for Si(100) NWs and <12% for mc-Si NWs) compared to similar to 35% for the polished surface in the 350-1000 nm wavelength range. The remarkably low reflection surface of SiNW arrays has great potential for use as an effective light absorber material in novel photovoltaic architectures, and other optoelectronic and photonic devices.

AB We report a hybrid heterojunction solar cell based on silicon nanochannel (SiNC) arrays and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophane):poly-styrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) in excess of 9.50%. The described device is produced by spin coating the organic polymer PEDOT:PSS on SiNC arrays fabricated employing metal assisted electroless chemical etching methods. We utilized an ultrathin Atomic Layer Deposited (ALD) aluminum oxide (Al2O3) interface passivation layer between the SiNC arrays and PEDOT:PSS layer and its influence on the photovoltaic performance of the device is analyzed herein. An open circuit voltage (Voc) and a short circuit current density (J(SC)) as high as 565 my and 28.4 mA/cm(2), respectively, were achieved, which lead to a PCE of 9.52% for the optimized SiNC depth of 1.35 mu m even without an antireflection coating and back surface field enhancement. The electrical performance of the described device is also analyzed in terms of the capacitance voltage (C-V) measurements collected at room temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic photovoltaic devices are interesting alternatives to conventional silicon based photovoltaic cells, due to potentially lower material costs and energy consumption during the fabrication process. However, the energy conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells may still be improved. One possible approach is a combination with metallic nanostructures to improve light absorption properties in the active layer. We report on the fabrication and characterization of metallic nanogratings integrated with an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode to be combined with small-molecule organic photovoltaic cells. With respect to geometry and extinction properties gratings fabricated by two different fabrication methods, conventional electron beam lithography and nanoimprint lithography, are presented. Furthermore, gratings fabricated on top of ITO are compared to gratings integrated both below and within ITO electrodes. Fabricating structures below or within electrodes is advantageous for organic thin film techniques to avoid compromising the crystallinity of the organic thin film and short-circuiting across the thin layer.

AB Metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) using a nanosphere lithography (NSL) technique is regarded as a general fabrication method for silicon nanowire (SINW) arrays. However, morphology control of SiNWs using this method has not been reported. In this study, silicon nanowire (SINW) and silicon nanocone (SINC) arrays were fabricated by MACE using a NSL. Depending on the concentration of etchants in the etching solution, the morphology of the wires and etching rate were systemically changed. At high concentrations, the wires were etched cylindrically and at low concentrations, tapered (cone-like) wires were obtained. To quantify the degree of tapering, the volume ratio of the etched part was calculated from their morphology. The degree of tapering increased as the concentrations of etchants decreased. We suggest that the mechanism of the formation of nanocone is related to the degree of hole diffusion under the metal layer, which was supported by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images.

AB We demonstrate a scalable and repeatable method to fabricate micro/nanotubes. Mask-based diffraction lithography was modeled, and the effects of key parameters including the wavelength of the illuminant light, the thickness of the photoresist, the diameter of the photomask pattern and the exposure dose during the process were simulated. Analysis of the results indicates that the optical intensity distributions in the photoresist form separated regions, which can be used to fabricate micro/nanotubes. Experiments were then carried out, and we achieved the production of silicon microtubes and tube-in-tube arrays. It can be found that the outer diameter of the microtubes decreases while the inner diameter increases with the increment of exposure time, consistent with the simulation results. Thus, the optical model is suitable for explaining experimental phenomena, guiding experiments and optimizing the fabrication process. The obtained silicon microtubes exhibit fine hydrophobic properties and provide a good matrix for integrating active nanomaterials, which can provide great potential in their application to energy storage devices, solar cells, sensors and catalysts.

AB Semiconductor photonic microcavities are currently very important elements in the field of photonics. We here report the light-trapping ability of 3D silicon spherical micrometer-sized photonic cavities, which are fabricated via simple chemical methods, as well as the results of quality factor measurements. We show, through both experiments and theoretical modeling, that the observed quality factor of the modes of a spherical silicon microcavity located on a dielectric substrate can be easily tuned by changing only the incident angle of the light. This special angle-dependent property could be used to design high-efficiency angle-resolved photodetectors and micrometer-sized optoelectronic power sources.

Simulated results show that DLAR coatings can flexibly modulate the color with reduced current losses compared to single SiNx:H layer. SiOxNy was deposited by electron beam evaporation onto fabricated industrial solar cells to vary their colors. The busbars were sheltered by a mask to prevent the deposition of SiOxNy on them. This simplified method avoids adjustment of the standard fabricating process. High agreement between simulated and measured reflectance is achieved. The IV test results of colored solar cells are in good accord with the calculated results, which indicates the effectiveness of DLAR coatings in reducing the current losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Future wafer-based silicon solar cells will be fabricated on thin (< 140 mu m) wafers. However, technologies to handle thin wafers during cell processing are not yet available for industry. In this paper, a flow to handle thin wafers during rear side cell processing is developed and demonstrated on 4-in 200 mu m-thick wafers. The flow involves bonding the wafers to glass after front-side processing followed by a low-temperature p-n heterojunction formation on the rear side. 2.5 x 2.5 cm(2) amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction interdigitated back-contact solar cells are fabricated by use of lithography while bonded to glass, and they show an efficiency of up to 17.7%. Shunts, infrared light absorption, and rear side interface passivation are identified as the main efficiency losses. Dedicated experiments suggest that the passivation losses are related to the degradation of the adhesive during wafer cleaning. Hence, methods to improve the compatibility of the adhesive with the cleaning process are discussed.

AB In this study, a low-cost, self-assembled wrinkle structured aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) was developed for crystalline silicon solar cells by a simple sol-gel deposition process. The deposited thin films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy. It was found that by adapting the proposed AZO thin film coating, there is a reduction in reflectance between wavelengths of around 450-700 nm, which suggests a better light trapping. Crystalline silicon solar cells were fabricated with and without the wrinkled AZO integration and evaluated using a simulated solar light. It was found that the use of wrinkled AZO thin film resulted in a 20% increase in power conversion. The improvement in photovoltaic performances originated from the enhanced light trapping.

AB We developed high throughput, high efficiency 1.43 m(2) hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) single-junction photovoltaic (PV) modules using a two-step deposition for the intrinsic a-Si:H absorber with the high deposition rate of 0.41 nm/s. The developed module using the two-step deposition method leads to higher initial maximum power (Pmax) due to the reduced recombination loss at the p/i interface, compared to the a-Si:H single-junction PV module fabricated by the conventional one-step deposition with the low deposition rate of 0.20 nm/s. In addition, the developed module exhibits moderate light-induced degradation ratio of 26.1% in an outdoor exposure test with accumulated solar irradiance > 380 kWh/m(2). Thus, the comparable energy output gain is confirmed via a long-term outdoor field test. Consequently, superior throughput of the developed module over the conventional module is possible with comparable stabilized performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, with spherical SiO2 particles fabricated via Stober method, monodispersed and uniform SO2@Y2O3:Eu3+ core shell submicrospheres were prepared through a simply homogeneous precipitation method. SEM, TEM and XRD analysis indicated that the as-prepared samples were uniform and well monodispersed spheres. The SiO2 core was perfectly coated by the shell composed of cubic crystalline Y2O3:Eu3+ and the thickness of the shell was about 26 nm. Photoluminescence spectra showed that the luminescence efficiency was improved remarkably after being coated on the SiO2 core. The 3D PL spectra showed that almost all UV photons in the range from 200 nm to 400 nm can be converted to visible photons by the as-prepared samples. Results showed that when the SiO2 core was synthesized in the TEOS single feeding model with the amount of core being 0.4 g, doping concentration being 4% and annealing at 800 degrees C, the sample has the best performance on luminescence. By dispersing the as-prepared sample in the anti-reflection sol to prepared the wavelength conversion and anti-reflection film and apply it to the silicon solar cell, the photoelectric conversion efficiency can be increased by 7.41% in maximum.

AB A 3 mu m thick silicon layers with nano-scale honeycomb structure on the surface were fabricated using the mask less process, "Thermal-stress Induced Pattern Transfer method". The thin silicon layer was deposited on a patterned sapphire substrate with nano-scale pyramids, followed by a metal layer printing on the top of the thin silicon layer. After thermal treatment, a thin silicon layer was peeled off from the patterned sapphire substrate and was transferred to the metal layer. Meanwhile, the periodic patterns on the sapphire substrate were transferred to the thin silicon layer forming the honeycomb structure on the surface of the silicon layer. The whole process was operated at a low temperature below 250 C without any mask process. Finally, the solar cell was fabricated on the silicon thin layer and its performance was measured. The short circuit current density is 0.11mA/cm(2). (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present the design considerations of an autonomous wireless sensor and discuss the fabrication and testing of the various components including the energy harvester, the active sensing devices and the power management and sensor interface circuits. A common materials platform, namely, nanowires, enables us to fabricate state-of-the-art components at reduced volume and show chemical sensing within the available energy budget. We demonstrate a photovoltaic mini-module made of silicon nanowire solar cells, each of 0.5 mm(2) area, which delivers a power of 260 mu W and an open circuit voltage of 2 V at one sun illumination. Using nanowire platforms two sensing applications are presented. Combining functionalised suspended Si nanowires with a novel microfluidic fluid delivery system, fully integrated microfluidic-sensor devices are examined as sensors for streptavidin and pH, whereas, using a microchip modified with Pd nanowires provides a power efficient and fast early hydrogen gas detection method. Finally, an ultra-low power, efficient solar energy harvesting and sensing microsystem augmented with a 6 mAh rechargeable battery allows for less than 20 mu W power consumption and 425 h sensor operation even without energy harvesting.

AB Liquid phase crystallization (LPC) using e-beam or CW-laser line sources of amorphous or nanocrystalline silicon films has emerged as new method to form high quality absorbers on cheap substrates. A disadvantage of electron beam crystallization was the necessity to use amorphous SiCx layers in contact with the silicon to maintain a stable crystallization process, resulting in high surface recombination. In this work we investigate capping layers to enable e-beam induced LPC on alternative interlayer materials especially SiO2 and characterize the morphological and electrical properties of these layer stacks. Photoluminescence measurements of LPC absorbers on SiO2 layers exhibit significantly increased radiative recombination compared to SiCx. Fabricated hetero-junction cells achieved a new emitter area efficiency record for electron beam induced LPC solar cells of 9% using the FrontERA contact system and H passivation.

AB In situ grown p-nc-Si:H/a-SiCx:H quantum dot superlattice has been prepared by RF-PECVD at a low temperature of 150 degrees C using layer by layer technique. This preparation method for fabricating superlattice allows controlling the properties of Si quantum dots in potential wells and the characteristics of potential barrier without subsequent annealing treatment, which is fully compatible with thin film Si technologies. High resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations confirm the superlattice structure of silicon quantum dots (similar to 2 nm diameter) separated by a-SiCx:H matrix (2-3 nm thickness) with several periods. Strong room-temperature photoluminescence and the blue-shift of the PL peak position with increasing barrier height are indicative of quantum confinement effects. Applying p-nc-Si:H/a-SiCx:H superlattice as window layers, high open circuit voltage (> 0.99 V) was achieved for n-i-p type a-Si:H single junction solar cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We fabricated zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (NRs) with ZnO seed layers by using the sol-gel solution method with various annealing temperatures on different substrate materials (silicon, glass, and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass). Within a certain range of seed annealing temperatures, the alignment and length of the NRs were significantly improved. However, the growth rate of the NRs was less affected by the substrate material at a fixed seed annealing temperature. From X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, the NRs grown on the silicon substrate exhibited better crystallinity than those grown on the glass and FTO coated glass substrates. During the growth process for the NRs, the self-attraction phenomenon occurred, which led to a decrease in the NR density and improved the alignment, resulting in a highly c-axis oriented ZnO NR growth on the substrate.

AB Stable aqueous amino-grafted silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs-NH2) were prepared via one-pot solution method. By grafting amino groups on the particle surface, the dispersion of SiNPs in water became very stable and clear aqueous solutions could be obtained. By incorporating SiNPs-NH2 into the hole transport layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS), the performance of polymer solar cells composed of poly[2-methoxy,5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as active layer can be improved. SiNPs-NH2 are dispersed uniformly in the PEDOT:PSS solution and help form morphologies with small-sized domains in the PEDOT:PSS film. SiNPs-NH2 serve as screens between conducting polymer PEDOT and ionomer PSS to improve the phase separation and charge transport of the hole transport layer. As a result, the sheet resistance of PEDOT:PSS thin films is decreased from (93 +/- 5) x 10(5) to (13 +/- 3) x 10(5) Omega/a-. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells was thus improved by 9.8% for devices fabricated with PEDOT:PSS containing 1 wt% of SiNPs-NH2, compared with the devices fabricated by original PEDOT:PSS.

AB Honeycomb-structured solar cell is proposed for photovoltaic building block applications. Honeycomb-like substrates were prepared either by a conventional semiconductor processing or by a low cost wet-chemical method, and amorphous Si thin film solar cells were fabricated on these substrates. We have demonstrated one of the essential requirements for building block application, which is the low sensitivity of the light incidence angles on the power conversion efficiency; and we have identified the critical processing issues through the experimental study using various thin film deposition methods. This honeycomb-structured solar cell is a promising candidate for the future photovoltaic building block applications enabling the inherent high strength-to-weight ratio and higher efficiency at an oblique light incidence.

AB We describe a strategy for selectively coating the vertical surfaces of standing nanopillars using area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD). Hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are utilised to selectively inhibit the coating of oxides on the modified horizontal regions to ensure that only the vertical surfaces of vertical standing nanorods are coated using ALD processes. This method makes it possible to fabricate vertical nanodevices using a simple process of depositing oxide layer on a vertical surface, and can also be applied to the area-selective surface passivation of other standing structures.

AB Light-absorbing and electrically conductive binary CN (x) nanocone (CNNC) arrays have been fabricated using a glow discharge plasma-assisted reaction deposition method. The intact CNNCs with amorphous structure and central nickel-filled pipelines could be vertically and neatly grown on nickel-covered substrates according to the catalyst-leading mode. The morphologies and composition of the as-grown CNNC arrays can be well controlled by regulating the methane/nitrogen mixture inlet ratio, and their optical absorption and resistivity strongly depend on their morphologies and composition. Beside large specific surface area, the as-grown CNNC arrays demonstrate high wideband absorption, good conduction, and nice wettability to polymer absorbers.

AB We theoretically explain and experimentally demonstrate light trapping in thin-film solar cells through guided-mode resonance (GMR) effects. Resonant field enhancement and propagation path elongation lead to enhanced solar absorption. We fabricate nanopatterned solar cells containing embedded 300-nm period, one-dimensional gratings. The grating pattern is fabricated on a glass substrate using laser interference lithography followed by a transparent conducting oxide coating as a top contact. A similar to 320-nm thick p-i-n hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell is deposited over the patterned substrate followed by bottom contact deposition. We measure optical and electrical properties of the resonant solar cells. Compared to a planar reference solar cell, around 35% integrated absorption enhancement is observed over the 450 to 750-nm wavelength range. This light-management method results in enhanced short-circuit current density of 14.8 mA/cm(2), which is a similar to 40% improvement over planar solar cells. Our experimental demonstration proves the potential of simple and well-designed GMR features in thin-film solar cells. (C) The Authors.

AB This paper reports the effects of varied deposition conditions on the resultant energy conversion efficiencies of thin-film silicon solar cells. Cells were deposited using an Oxford Instruments PlasmaLab System 100 on to Pilkington TEC-8 TCO glass, and thoroughly investigated using electrical methods. Thin film devices were fabricated using the decomposition of silane gas within a reaction chamber of 13.56MHz plasma discharge. The deposition conditions, including substrate temperature, gas flow rates, RF power, chamber pressure, and film thickness are all explored to determine the optimum cell performance. A view toward high-efficiency solar structures, including heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) and micro-morph cell designs using the same conditions is presented.

AB High density ordered Si nanowire arrays can be fabricated from a Fe2O3 template annealed from polystyrene (PS) microsphere layers via a metal-assisted chemical etching method. The metal mesh films, containing position-and density-defined pores that determine the position and density of the remaining structures after etching, are extremely important for achieving high quality Si nanowires. By adding a structural inversion process, a Au metal mesh with arrays of high density nanopores is devised as a catalyst for metal-assisted chemical etching of silicon. The density of Si nanowires can be increased to two times that of the single-layer PS microspheres and further to three times when a double layer of PS microspheres is introduced. The two-step template method for the preparation of high-density Si nanowires shows great potential in the fields of nanofabrication and nanoelectronics.
