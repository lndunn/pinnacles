TI Light Scattering and Current Enhancement for Microcrystalline Silicon
   Thin-Film Solar Cells on Aluminium-Induced Texture Glass Superstrates
   with Double Texture
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BACK REFLECTOR
AB Microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) thin-film solar cells are processed on glass superstrates having both micro- and nanoscale surface textures. The microscale texture is realised at the glass surface, using the aluminium-induced texturing (AIT) method, which is an industrially feasible process enabling a wide range of surface feature sizes (i.e., 700 nm-3 mu m) of the textured glass. The nanoscale texture is made by conventional acid etching of the sputter-deposited transparent conductive oxide (TCO). The influence of the resulting "double texture" on the optical scattering is investigated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) (studying the surface topology), haze measurements (studying scattering into air), and short-circuit current enhancement measurements (studying scattering into silicon). A predicted enhanced optical scattering efficiency is experimentally proven by a short-circuit current enhancement Delta I-sc of up to 1.6mA/cm(2) (7.7% relative increase) compared to solar cells fabricated on a standard superstrate, that is, planar glass covered with nanotextured TCO. Enhancing the autocorrelation length (or feature size) of the AIT superstrates might have the large potential to improve the mu c-Si:H thin-film solar cell efficiency, by reducing the shunting probability of the device while maintaining a high optical scattering performance.

TI Broadband light trapping based on periodically textured ZnO thin films

DT Article
ID SILICON SOLAR-CELLS; DESIGN
AB Transparent conductive front electrodes (TCFEs) deployed in photovoltaic devices have been extensively studied for their significance in transporting carriers, coupling and trapping the incident photons in high-performing solar cells. The trade-off between the light-transmission, electrical, and scattering properties for TCFEs to achieve a broadband improvement in light absorption in solar cells while maintaining a high electrical performance has become the key issue to be tackled. In this paper, we employ self-assembled polystyrene (PS) spheres based on a sauna-like method as a template, followed by a double-layer deposition and then successfully fabricate highly-transparent, well-conductive, and large-scale periodically-textured ZnO TCFEs with broadband light trapping properties. A sheet resistance below 15 Omega sq(-1) was achieved for the periodically-textured ZnO TCFEs, with a concomitant average transmission of 81% (including the glass substrate) in the 400-1100 nm spectral range, a haze improvement in a broadband spectral range, and a wider scattering angular domain. The proposed approach affords a promising alternative method to prepare periodically-textured TCFEs, which are essential for many optoelectronic device semiconductors, such as photovoltaic and display applications.

AB Graphene (Gr) film grown by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has recently received intense attention in optoelectronic devices. As an alternative, the low cost graphene-oxide (GO) fabricated by a solution process is more promising for practical application. Here, we have fabricated a GO film on copper foil and then reduced it into a conductive film by high temperature annealing. It is found that the photoelectric properties of the reduced-graphene-oxide (r-GO) film are strongly dependent on the annealing temperature and film thickness. A thicker r-GO film under higher temperature annealing usually has better conductivity. By optimizing the reduction conditions of the GO films, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.36% can be achieved for a r-GO/Si solar cell. This value is currently the record efficiency for the r-GO/Si device architecture.

AB We propose the fabrication of two types high performance texturized antireflective structures on crystalline (100) silicon (c-Si) surface by hybrid picosecond laser scanning irradiation followed by chemical corrosion. The design and the fabrication with high controllable performance were studied. The hybrid method includes 1064 nm picosecond (ps) laser scanning to form micro-hole array and subsequently short-time alkaline corrosion. After ps laser processing, there is little reconsolidation and heat affect zone on the silicon surface, which is beneficial to achieve the precise chemical corrosion effect. Depending on the laser scanning intervals, scanning times and chemical corrosion time, a variety of surface texture morphologies, even a special micro-nano hierarchical structure in which finer nano-structures formed in the micro units of the texture, were achieved. Observing with SEM, the average diameter of the micro-holes in the micro-nano hierarchica is 25 similar to 30 mu m, while the average size of the nano-level ladder-like structures on the micro-hole wall is from dozens to hundreds of nanometers. Comparing to the traditional laser texturing techniques for c-Si solar cell, the whole laser processing was carried out in an open air ambient without using etch mask and SF6/O-2 plasma. The results show the reflectance value of the fabricated c-Si surfaces can reach as low as 6% (400 nm similar to 1000 nm). This is a potential method for economical antireflective structures fabrication which is ideal for using in the high-efficiency silicon-based photoelectronic devices.

AB Boron-doped amorphous carbon (a-C:B) films were successfully synthesized via a bias-assisted pyrolysis-chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The effect of substrate bias on the thickness, surface morphology, electrical properties of a-C:B film were investigated. The AFM measurements and conductivity result show the surface roughness and resistivity of a-C:B films decreases with increasing substrate bias from 0 to -20V. The fabricated films were evaluated for use in photovoltaic solar cells. The fabricated solar cell with the configuration of Au/p-C:B/n-Si/Au achieved conversion efficiency (eta) of 1.431% at applied bias voltage of -20 V. This result showed the successful interstitial doping of boron in the amorphous carbon films deposited by this method.

AB We propose a novel quantum-dot sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) structure that employs a quantum dot/semiconductor silicon (QD/Si) coaxial nanorod array to replace the conventional dye/TiO2/TCO photoelectrode. We replaced the backlight input mode with top-side illumination and used a quantum dot to replace dye as the light-absorbing material. Photon-excited photoelectrons can be effectively transported to each silicon nanorod and conveyed to the counter electrode. We use two-stage metal-assisted etching (MAE) to fabricate the micro-nano hybrid structure on a silicon substrate. We then use the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method to synthesize a Sb2S3 quantum dot on the surface of each silicon nanorod to form the photoelectrode for the quantum dot/semiconductor silicon coaxial nanorod array. We use a xenon lamp to simulate AM 1.5G (1000W/m(2)) sunlight. Then, we investigate the influence of different silicon nanorod arrays and CBD deposition times on the photoelectric conversion efficiency. When an NH (N-type with high resistance) silicon substrate is used, the QD/Si coaxial nanorod array synthesized by three runs of Sb2S3 deposition shows the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency of 0.253%. The corresponding short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor are 5.19mA/cm(2), 0.24V, and 20.33%, respectively.

The effects of various geometry parameters (i.e., height, filling ratio, and period) of conical MCs on the SU8 film/Si structure including different thicknesses of MgF2 films on the reflectance properties are investigated by a theoretical analysis using a rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulation. For the fabricated samples, their optical characteristics and surface wetting behaviors are also explored. The MgF2 film-coated SU8 MCs on Si substrates (i.e., MgF2/SU8 MCs/Si) exhibit a superhydrophilic surface with very low water contact angles of < 10 similar to and reduce the surface reflection of the bare Si over a wide wavelength of 350-1100 nm, showing the lower average reflectance (R-avg) and solar weighted reflectance (R-sw) values of similar to 14% and similar to 12.1%, respectively, (i.e., R-avg similar to 15.1% and R-sw similar to 13% for the SU8 MCs/Si and R-avg similar to 38.5% and R-sw similar to 38% for the bare Si). Furthermore, the MgF2/SU8 MCs on glasses also show strong light scattering in transmissions at wavelengths of 350-1100 nm, which indicates an average haze ratio of similar to 89.8%, while maintaining high total transmissions. Both the measured and calculated reflectance spectra showed similar results.

AB In this study, the carbon-matrix Ag wing with a hierarchical sub-micron antireflection quasi-photonic crystal structure (HSAS) was fabricated by a simple and promising method. This method combines chemosynthesis with biomimetic techniques, without the requirement of expensive equipment and energy intensive processes. Here, the Troides helena (Linnaeus) (T. helena) forewing (T_FW) was chosen as the biomimetic template. The carbon-matrix Ag butterfly wing (Ag@C_T_FW) achieves a drastically enhanced infrared absorption over a broad spectral range, especially, over the near infrared region. Here, we report methods to enhance and modify the plasmonic resonances in such structures by strongly coupling plasmonic resonances to HSAS. Using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, the absorption spectra and the distribution of the energy density near the Ag NPs surface were simulated. Based on the experiment and simulation results, these findings demonstrate that the enhanced infrared absorption over a broad spectral range is due to the mechanism that the plasmon and the coherent coupling between adjacent resonance systems integrate with the HSAS.

AB With the continuous development of sawing technology for silicon wafers, the use of thin silicon wafers for solar cells has become an effective method to decrease the cost of industrial silicon solar cells. This study focused on the solar cells based on the concept of a structure with a homogeneous emitter and passivated rear surface (PERC solar cells). Fabricated using normal production equipment, the performance of PERC solar cells with thicknesses of 80, 100, 120, and 160 mu m was compared, and the differences were discussed based on the measurements of optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. The highest efficiency was recorded for a solar-cell thickness of 120 mu m. By optimizing the Al paste and firing condition, we obtained PERC solar cells with a thickness of 80 mu m, and there has been about a 0.2% reduction in cell efficiency compared to cells with a thickness of 160 mu m. Good tortuosity of thin silicon cell opens a wider range of applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB We report a gradual transition in the deposition product from pure Cu2O to pure Cu, during electrodeposition on Au/Pd sputtercoated silicon wafer substrates in copper sulfate electrolyte with various dc potential. At voltages lower than 0.3 V, only pure Cu in a nanocrystalline form is deposited on the cathode substrate, while at voltages higher than 1.2 V, only pure Cu2O, also in a nano/microcrystalline form, is deposited. At intermediate voltages between 0.3 to 1.2 V, the deposition product comprises a mixture of both Cu and Cu2O nano/micro-crystals. The Cu2O crystals are generally of an octahedral shape with sizes ranging from 30 nm to 100 nm, while Cu nano/microcrystals are of irregular shape ranging from 100 nm to 2 mu m. This work provides a method to fabricate nanocrystalline Cu2O, Cu and Cu/Cu2O on substrates in a single step without the use of additives. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB Semiconductor nanowires are great candidates for building novel electronic devices. Considering the cost of fabricating such devices, substrate reuse and gold consumption are the main concerns. Here we report on implementation of high throughput gold electrodeposition for selective deposition of metal seed particles in arrays defined by lithography for nanowire synthesis. By use of this method, a reduction in gold consumption by a factor of at least 300 was achieved, as compared to conventional thermal evaporation for the same pattern. Because this method also facilitates substrate reuse, a significantly reduced cost of the final device is expected. We investigate the morphology, crystallography, and optical properties of InP and GaAs nanowires grown from electrodeposited gold seed particles and compare them with the properties of nanowires grown from seed particles defined by thermal evaporation of gold. We find that nanowire synthesis, as well as the material properties of the grown nanowires are comparable and quite independent of the gold deposition technique. On the basis of these results, electrodeposition is proposed as a key technology for large-scale fabrication of nanowire-based devices.

AB We comprehensively investigated the performance of solar cells made from quasi-single crystalline silicon (QSC-Si) cast by the seed-assisted directional solidification (DS) method and its relationship with the area ratio of < 1 0 0 > -oriented single crystal of a QSC-Si wafer. It is found that the cell performance improvement triggered by alkaline texturing is more notable for the QSC-Si wafers with a morphology of higher < 1 0 0 > -oriented single crystal ratio, and the difference in cell efficiency between alkaline and acidic texturing is up to an absolute value of 1.05%. As the single crystal ratio of the QSC-Si wafer decreases from 100% to 50%, the cell efficiency decreases from 18.15% to 17.04%. We also compared the performance of typical CZ-Si solar cells and the QSC-Si solar cells made from wafers with fully < 1 0 0 > -oriented single crystal. It is found that the average efficiency of QSC-Si solar cells is about 0.8% absolutely lower than that of the CZ-Si solar cells, and it has a substantially wider range of distribution due to dislocation propagation.

AB A facile, green, and low-cost process for fabricating silicon solar cells safely at home or in school is presented. In the process, we not only prepare a H3PO4-based nontoxic spin-on diffusion source, but also replace the hazardous HF with KOH for removal of the residual silica glass after diffusion. Furthermore, for enhancing the efficiency of solar cells, we employ a simple and low toxic sol-gel method to fabricate the TiO2 antireflection layer on the solar cell. Experimental results show that KOH not only effectively removes residual silica glass, it also etches back the dead layer, resulting in the reduced minority carrier recombination. However, as KOH can also etch away silicon, care should be taken to prevent over-etching of the silicon that damages the p-n junction. Si solar cells prepared with our approach reach 12.1% in efficiency. To test if our HF-free process also works on an optimized production process, we test our KOH etching step in an optimized solar cell process in a production line. An averaged cell efficiency of 17.5% was attained, which is comparable to that of 17.8% with cells fabricated in the traditional production process employing HF etching. This fact evidences the future potential of producing HF-free green solar cells.

AB We demonstrated for the first time that optically transparent and conductive polysiloxanes/PEDOT: PSS nanocomposite thin films were produced at 85 degrees C by mixing a sol-gel modified polysiloxane with the aqueous PEDOT: PSS solution. Polysiloxanes/PEDOT: PSS nanocomposite thin films were deposited by conventional solution-processed spin-or spray-coating methods, presenting superior water-and scratch-resistance. similar to 100 Omega square(-1) sheet resistance with similar to 80% transmittance was obtained and was further reduced to 25 Omega square(-1) by adding 90 nm similar to 20 nm Ag nanowires to the solution. The p-type polysiloxanes/PEDOT: PSS nanocomposite thin films were then applied on n-type c-Si wafers to fabricate organic-inorganic Schottky hybrid photovoltaic devices, demonstrating a similar performance in power conversion efficiency as PEDOT: PSS. However, to the best of our knowledge our high conductive polysiloxanes/PEDOT: PSS nanocomposite c-Si hybrid photovoltaic devices presented the best stability among this type of devices under the ambient environment. Performance of our photovoltaic devices kept no degradation even if the devices were immersed in water without encapsulation for protection.

AB We report here a new method to improve the performance of GaInP solar cells by fabricating Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) atop the devices through a simple wet-chemical method. The size and density of Ag NPs can be easily optimized by changing the concentration of AgNO3 solution and/ or the reaction time. The Ag NPs support surface plasmonic resonances (SPRs) and thus greatly increase light absorbance and photocurrent responses of the solar cells by the scattering and re- reflection of incident light. We find that, for a Ag NPs density of similar to 3.37 x 10(10) cm(-2), the short-circuit current density (J(sc)) increases by 19.5% from 14.9 to 17.8 mA cm(-2), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases by 20.4% from 15.2% to 18.3%.

AB High-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells require advanced textures at the front contacts for light management. In this contribution, the influence of the texture of various transparent conductive oxides (TCO) on the effectiveness of an intermediate reflector layer (IRL) in a-Si:H/mu c-Si:H tandem solar cells is investigated. The employed front side TCOs include several types of sputter-etched ZnO:Al, LPCVD ZnO:B and APCVD SnO2 : F. The topographies after different stages of the deposition process of the tandem solar cell, at the front TCO, after deposition of the amorphous top cell and after the deposition of the microcrystalline bottom cell, were characterized by atomic force microscopy at precisely the same spot. The external quantum efficiency of the fabricated solar cells were measured and successfully reproduced by a finite-difference time-domain method applying the measured topographies at each interface of the solar cell. With these simulations, the impact of structure type and feature size on the effectiveness of the IRL is investigated. The highest IRL effectiveness in a tandem solar cell was found for double-textured ZnO: Al. In this contribution, we study the interplay between interface textures and parasitic losses. Our findings are relevant for the design of topography for optimized IRL performance.

ID EMITTER; INTERFACE; COLLECTION
AB A micro-grooved electrode structure is investigated to illustrate its advantages when applied to the back-contact back-junction (BC-BJ) silicon solar cell. The finite element analysis shows that the micro-grooved electrodes enhances the photo-carrier collection and weakens the dependence of collection ability on pitch distance. The geometries of micro-groove are found to have little impact on the cell performance. These advantages open possibilities for the implementation of low cost fabrication methods. As a demonstration, a process involving laser doping and screen printing techniques are proposed and analyzed. The simulation results show that the laser induced lattice damage causes negligible deterioration of device electrical properties and the presence of parasitic metal insulator semiconductor structure near the screen printed electrodes actually leads to a performance improvement rather than degradation. Our preliminary results indicate that the micro-grooved electrode structure is promising for fabricating low cost high efficiency BC-BJ silicon solar cells.

AB A technique of using laser doped isolation lines to separate shunted edge regions from the active area of a solar cell is presented. Photoluminescence images are used to investigate the effectiveness of the edge isolation. Screen-printed silicon solar cells are fabricated to demonstrate the ability of the technique to remove the shunt path from the front emitter to rear contact whilst minimising edge recombination. It is found that a reduction of J(02) by on average a factor of more than three is possible compared to the standard method of cleaving for these laboratory cells, yielding an average improvement in FF of 1.7%(abs), and 0.5%(abs) efficiency increase. The J(02) values achieved using this process are comparable to those achieved on solar cells with edges passivated with a thermal oxide. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Boron doped nanocrystalline-Si:H/a-SiCx:H (nc-Si:H/a-SiCx:H) quantum dot superlattice has been prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition at a low temperature of 150 degrees C. This method for fabricating superlattice allows controlling both the size and density of Si quantum dots in potential well and the characteristics of potential barrier without subsequent annealing treatment. Cross-section high resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations confirm the periodic multi-layer structure of silicon quantum dots (similar to 2 nm diameter) separated by a-SiCx:H matrix (2-3 nm thickness) with sharp interface. With strong blue photoluminescence and high perpendicular conductivity, boron doped nc-Si:H/a-SiCx:H quantum dot superlattice shows great advantages in obtaining applicable blue light emission.

AB A new self-powered broadband photodetector was fabricated by coating an n-silicon nanowire (n-Si NW) array with a layer of p-cupric oxide (CuO) nanoflakes through a new simple solution synthesis method. The p-n heterojunction shows excellent rectification characteristics in the dark and distinctive photovoltaic behavior under broadband light illumination. The photoresponse of the detector at zero bias voltage shows that this self-powered photodetector is highly sensitive to visible and near-infrared light illuminations, with excellent stability and reproducibility. Ultrafast response rise and recovery times of 60 and 80 mu s, respectively, are shown by the CuO based nanophotodetector. In addition, the broadband photodetector can also provide a rapid binary response, with current changing from positive to negative upon illumination under a small bias. The binary response arises from the photovoltaic behavior and the low turn-on voltage of the CuO/Si NW device. These properties make the CuO/Si NW broadband photodetector suitable for applications that require high response speeds and self-sufficient functionality.

AB Functional silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are promising building blocks in the design of highly sensitive photodetectors and bio-chemical sensors. We systematically investigate the photoresponse properties of ultrathin SiNWs (20 nm) fabricated using a size-reduction method based on e-beam lithography and tetramethylammonium hydroxide wet-etching. The high-quality SiNWs were able to detect light from the UV to the visible range with excellent sensitivity (similar to 1 pW/array), good time response, and high photoresponsivity (R similar to 2.5 x 10(4) A/W). Improvement of the ultrathin SiNWs' photoresponse has been observed in comparison to 40nm counter-part nanowires. These properties are attributable to the predominance surface-effect due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of ultrathin SiNWs. Long-term measurements at different temperatures in both the forward and reverse bias directions demonstrated the stability and reliability of the fabricated device. By sensitizing the fabricated SiNW arrays with cadmium telluride quantum dots (QDs), hybrid QD SiNW devices displayed an improvement in photocurrent response under UV light, while preserving their performance in the visible light range. The fast, stable, and high photoresponse of these hybrid nanostructures is promising towards the development of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB The phosphorus barrier layers at the doping procedure of silicon wafers were fabricated using a spin-coating method with a mixture of silica-sol and tetramethylammonium hydroxide, which can be formed at the rear surface prior to the front phosphorus spin-on-demand (SOD) diffusion and directly annealed simultaneously with the front phosphorus layer. The optimization of coating thickness was obtained by changing the applied spin-coating speed; from 2,000 to 8,000 rpm. The CZ-Si p-type silicon solar cells were fabricated with/without using the rear silica-sol layer after taking the sheet resistance measurements, SIMS analysis, and SEM measurements of the silica-sol material evaluations into consideration. For the fabrication of solar cells, a spin-coating phosphorus source was used to form the n(+) emitter and was then diffused at 930 degrees C for 35 min. The out-gas diffusion of phosphorus could be completely prevented by spin-coated silica-sol film placed on the rear side of the wafers coated prior to the diffusion process. A roughly 2% improvement in the conversion efficiency was observed when silica-sol was utilized during the phosphorus diffusion step. These results can suggest that the silica-sol material can be an attractive candidate for low-cost and easily applicable spin-coating barrier for any masking purpose involving phosphorus diffusion.

AB In this study, we applied a metal catalyst etching method to fabricate a nano/microhole array on a Si substrate for application in solar cells. In addition, the surface of an undesigned area was etched because of the attachment of metal nanoparticles that is dissociated in a solution. The nano/microhole array exhibited low specular reflectance (<1%) without antireflection coating because of its rough surface. The solar spectrum related total reflection was approximately 9%. A fabricated solar cell with a 40-mu m hole spacing exhibited an efficiency of 9.02%. Comparing to the solar cell made by polished Si, the external quantum efficiency for solar cell with 30 s etching time was increased by 16.7%.

AB The nanoscale modulation of material properties such as porosity and morphology is used in the natural world to mold the flow of light and to obtain structural colors. The ability to mimic these strategies while adding technological functionality has the potential to open up a broad array of applications. Porous photonic crystals are one such technological candidate, but have typically underachieved in terms of available materials, structural and optical quality, compatibility with different substrates (e.g., silicon, flexible organics), and scalability. We report here an alternative fabrication method based on the bottom-up self-assembly of elementary building blocks from the gas phase into high surface area photonic hierarchical nanostructures at room temperature. Periodic refractive index modulation is achieved by stacking layers with different nanoarchitectures. High-efficiency porous Bragg reflectors are successfully fabricated with sub-micrometer thick films on glass, silicon, and flexible substrates. High diffraction efficiency broadband mirrors (R approximate to 1), opto-fluidic switches, and arrays of photonic crystal pixels with size < 10 mu m are demonstrated. Possible applications in filtering, sensing, electro-optical modulation, solar cells, and photocatalysis are envisioned.

AB Resurgence of copper oxide based thin film solar cells demands exclusive methods of integrating various layers with superior constituents for increased solar-electric conversion efficiency. Exceedingly optically active nanostructured phase mixture of copper oxides was synthesized by an energy efficient hydrothermal process. Comprehensive structural and optical studies of these nanostructured copper oxides reveal its efficacy as a unique solar cell material. Excellent solar cell characteristics have been observed when these nanopowders are integrated with ZnO/CuO based thin films. X-ray diffraction, Raman micro-scattering, scanning electronmicroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and optoelectronic measurements were employed to characterize these unified electronic devices. Solar cell measurements indicate a considerable increase in short circuit current density (J(sc)) and open circuit voltage (V-oc) in the fabricated nanostructure powder-thin film hybrid solar cell devices. The solar cell efficiency of these nanopowder-thin film devices is found to be 2.88%. The physics behind this enrichment of solar cell properties has also been elucidated in the study. Exhaustive Raman spectroscopic and photoluminescence studies prove that multi-phonon scattering may play a major role for this enhancement. This integration of nanostructures with thin film solar cells can evolve to a new direction in photovoltaic technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High transmittance of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates is one of the most important factors for achieving high efficiency in thin-film silicon solar cells. Immersion (IM) method with CH2I2 liquid is widely used for the evaluation of optical properties (transmittance, reflectance and absorption) for TCO substrates with textured surface in order to reduce the scattering at the TCO surface. However, in order to measure transmittance accurately, three problems have been found. (1) CH2I2 liquid itself absorbs the light in short wavelength region. (2) The transmittance around the absorption edge of CH2I2 liquids is very sensitive to its amount. (3) Scattering cannot be suppressed when the scattering surfaces are more than 2 surfaces (for example, TCO on reactive ion etching (RIE) processed glass). To overcome these problems, we proposed a new setup to measure optical properties of TCO substrates by holding the samples inside the integral sphere. As the results, we have confirmed that their absorption in all wavelength could be measured accurately and the transmittance measured by the new method was well consistent with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the fabricated cell while the transmittance measured with conventional IM method showed differently. Therefore, this new method could be a useful tool to evaluate TCO substrates for thin-film silicon solar cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we present a technology for a high precision nanostructure replication process based on ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography for the application in the field of thin-film photovoltaics. The potential of the technology is demonstrated by the fabrication of microcrystalline silicon thin-film prototype solar cells. The high accuracy replication of random microstructures made from sputtered and etched ZnO:Al, used to scatter the incident light in thin solar cells, is shown by local topography investigations of the same 7.5x7.5 mu m(2) area on the master and the replica. Different types of imprint resists and imprint moulds were investigated to find the optimal, high precision replication technology. Two types of thin-film silicon solar cells, in p-i-n and n-i-p configuration, were fabricated to study the potential of the imprint technology for different applications. It is shown that solar cells deposited on an imprinted glass hold similar performances compared with reference solar cells fabricated with a standard process on textured ZnO:Al. Thus, it is demonstrated that the replication of light scattering structures by using an imprint process is an attractive method to decouple the scattering properties from the layer forming the electrical front contact. Because a simple and cheap high throughput process is used, this study additionally proves the relevance for the industrial mass production in the field of photovoltaics.

AB A CdS/Si nanoheterostructure array (CdS/Si-NPA) is fabricated by depositing CdS nanocrystals (nc-CdS) on the silicon nanoporous pillar array (Si-NPA) through a chemical bath deposition method. White light emission from the CdS/Si-NPA is observed under the excitation of 350 nm, which originates from the color mixing of blue emission from Si-NPA and green and red emissions from nc-CdS. The chromaticity coordinate, correlative color temperature and color rendering index are (0.29, 036), 8226 K and 66.0, respectively. The chromaticity coordinates are insensitive to the excitation wavelength between 320 nm and 350 nm. It is suggested that the CdS/Si-NPA might be a kind of potential phosphor in the white light diode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel method for fabricating two-dimensional arrays of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod patterns. Vertically aligned ZnO nanostructure patterns were synthesized by hydrothermal growth on a two-dimensional seed layer pattern formed by atomic layer deposition. Various characteristics of ZnO seed films were experimentally studied in order to optimize the fabrication of ZnO rod structures in terms of their uniformity and vertical alignment on the two-dimensional-patterned surfaces. Using these ZnO structures as hierarchical electrodes, we demonstrate that localized electric fields in the proximity of ZnO rod patterns can be used for periodic alignment of liquid crystal molecules, resulting in the optical diffraction grating effect. Process conditions for creating ZnO rod patterns that best enhance diffraction efficiency are further discussed. The current study is the first demonstration of hierarchical ZnO rod patterns as electrodes for optical modulation of a medium. We believe this will be beneficial for future optical applications.

AB A plasmonic heterostructure of Ag (nanoisland)/n-Al:ZnO/p-Si is fabricated using pulsed laser deposition and thermal evaporation method. In this structure Al:ZnO plays an important role of transparent conductive oxide (spacer layer) as well as the rectifying junction with silicon. By introducing the silver nanoislands on Al:ZnO, light harvesting has been enhanced because of plasmonic and light scattering effect. Morphology of Ag nanoparticles in consequence with the optical and electrical properties of the device has been studied. Optical reflection measurement of the device with Ag nanoisland shows remarkable improvement in both visible and UV regions compared to the bare n-Al:ZnO/p-Si heterostructure. Near band edge emission in photoluminescence has been enhanced with the deposition of Ag nanoislands. Dark and illumination current density has also been increased with the deposition of Ag nanoisland. Our experimental results suggest that integration of Ag nanoislands may help to improve the efficiency of hybrid silicon based photonic devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB GaAs-based triple-junction tandem solar cells incorporating an antireflection coating (ARC) consisting of a subwavelength structure (SWS) and bilayer thin films are reported. A high aspect ratio SWS was realized on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) using a two-step etched silicon template and a stamping method. The fabricated PMMA SWS consisting of a two-dimensional array of nanoscale needles with a period of 300 nm and an aspect ratio exceeding 2.3 exhibited significantly improved optical performance. The average reflectance of the PMMA SWS was reduced from 7.1 to 4.4% as compared to that of the bare PMMA film, which resulted in an improvement of the transmittance from 90.7 to 92.9% in the wavelength range between 300 and 1700 nm. By integrating the PMMA SWS together with a TiO2/Al2O3 bilayer AR coating onto the top of an InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell, the surface reflection of the solar cell could be minimized. The integrated PMMA SWS on the bilayer thin film ARC enhanced the power-conversion efficiency (eta) of the triple-junction solar cell from 30.2 to 31.6% and from 37.8 to 40.8% under 1 and 157 sun condition, respectively.

AB Fabricating functional compounds on substrates with complicated morphology has been an important topic in material science and technology, which remains a challenging issue to simultaneously achieve a high growth rate for a complex nanostructure with simple controlling factors. Here, we present a novel simple and successive method based on chemical reactions in an open reaction system manipulated by an electric field. A uniform CdS/TiO2 composite tubular structure has been fabricated in highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays in a very short time period (similar to 90 s) under room temperature (RT). The content of CdS in the resultant and its crystalline structure was tuned by the form and magnitude of external voltage. The as-formed structure has shown a quite broad and bulk-like light absorption spectrum with the absorption of photon energy even below that of the bulk CdS. The as-fabricated-sensitized solar cell based on this composite structure has achieved an efficiency of 1.43% without any chemical doping or co-sensitizing, 210% higher than quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) under a similar condition. Hopefully, this method can also easily grow nanostructures based on a wide range of compound materials for energy science and electronic technologies, especially for fast-deploying devices.

AB Growth of thin crystals on external substrate surfaces by many different methods is a well-known technique, but its extension to inner, enclosed surfaces of large defects in monocrystalline materials has not yet been reported. The literature on thin film growth and defects in materials can be leveraged to fabricate new structures for a variety of applications. Here we show a physical process of nucleation and evolution of nanocrystalline silver inside voids in monocrystalline silicon. We found that the Ag growth is hetero-epitaxial using a coincident site lattice. Alignment of Ag and Si atomic planes is uniformly observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and macroscopically by channeling Rutherford backscattering spectrometry.

AB We have reported a method to enhance the performance of graphene-Si (Gr/Si) Schottky junction solar cells by introducing Au nanoparticles (NPs) onto the monolayer graphene and few-layer graphene. The electron transfer between Au NPs and graphene leads to the increased work function and enhanced electrical conductivity of graphene, resulting in a remarkable improvement of device efficiency. By optimizing the initial thickness of Au layers, the power conversion efficiency of Gr/Si solar cells can be increased by more than three times, with a maximum value of 7.34%. These results show a route for fabricating efficient and stable Gr/Si solar cells. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Arrays of vertical silicon micropillar radial junction solar cells have been fabricated by diffusion of direct application spin on dopant and from the vapour phase through proximity rapid thermal diffusion. The micropillars were fabricated by optical lithography and deep reactive ion etching. The micropillar arrays show superior antireflective properties over the measured spectrum and good correlation to finite difference time domain modelling of identical geometry arrays. Junctions formed by a conventional spin on doping process of phosphorus containing dopant solution produced Suns-V-oc values in the region of 0.3 V. This value is likely due to difficulties encountered in achieving an even distribution of dopant over the entire surface of the arrays. An alternative method utilising spin on dopant but employing an intermediate vapour phase diffusion step produced promising results with Suns-V-oc values reaching 0.5 V following a post-diffusion drive-in step.

AB We demonstrate a substrate-free novel route for fabrication of solar grade silicon microwires for photovoltaic applications. The microwires are fabricated from low purity starting material via a bulk molten-core fibre drawing method. In-situ segregation of impurities during the directional solidification of the fibres yields solar grade silicon cores ( microwires) where the concentration of electrically detrimental transition metals has been reduced between one and two orders of magnitude. The microwires show bulk minority carrier diffusion lengths measuring similar to 40 mu m, and mobilities comparable to those of single-crystal silicon. Microwires passivated with amorphous silicon yield diffusion lengths comparable to those in the bulk. (C) 2014 Author(s).

ID NANOPARTICLES
AB Plasmonic light trapping is a topic of high interest, but research regarding this topic has been so far impeded owing to the lack of convenient methods to produce desired metal nanostructures in solar cells. To overcome this challenge, we herein introduced a transfer printing approach and performed demonstrative light trapping. Promising results were verified with superstrate-type hydrogenated microcrystalline Si cells fabricated on flat superstrates; for example, the photocurrent generated in the 650-1100 nm range increased to up to 60%. Since our transfer printing approach was applicable to textured surfaces, the integration of plasmon-mediated light trapping and front texture-mediated light trapping was also explored.

AB Surface quality of nanostructures has a significant influence on related device performance. In this study, a large number of dangling bonds are detected on the silicon nanocrystal (Si NC) surface after surface modification. These dangling bonds work as carrier traps and degrade particle electrical properties. Therefore, controlled particle oxidization is proposed as a substitution method for surface passivation, which can reduce carrier traps easily and effectively. Electron mobility is improved dramatically after a 12-hour controlled oxidation, and as a result, Si NC/PTB7 hybrid solar cells (HSC) achieves an efficiency of 3.6%; this is more than twice the efficiency of devices fabricated with fresh Si NCs (without passivation), and the highest efficiency for Si NC-based HSCs reported to date. However, excessive oxidation should be avoided because it introduces an oxygen rich layer on the particle surface, which blocks carrier transport and deteriorates electrical properties inversely.

AB Solar light harvesting cannot be efficiently managed unless and until the contribution of plasmonics in solar cells is fully realized. Such an investigation can be initiated and achieved by incorporating plasmonic nanoscatterers that support surface plasmons: excitations of conduction electrons at the interface/surface. The challenge is to fabricate these plasmonic scatterers in cost-effective method as well as without hampering optical, electrical and topographical properties of underneath layers. Here, in this report, we showed a simple two-step method in fabricating silver nanoparticles on zinc oxide followed by topographic and elemental analysis thereof. Numerical calculation and near-electric field distribution of single silver nanoparticles of different sizes was simulated by finite different time domain (FDTD) analysis. Since the distributed electric flux due to individual nanoparticles is crucial for excitons generation in active layer, such simulation predicts that nanoparticles excited by radiation of lower energy contribute wider electric flux sacrificing the intensity of localized electric field. A typical model was considered and FDTD simulation was carried out to understand the trend of absorption depth profile within the active layer involved in plasmonic solar cell.

AB We developed a novel cost effective process scheme for the fabrication of highly efficient selective emitter solar cells, which uses a laser doping method combined with an etch back process. The laser doping process using a 150 ns pulse width green (532 nm) laser effectively controls the doping profiles to form a selective emitter. However, laser damage was created on the laser-doped surface and eventually the performances and stabilities of laser-doped cells were degraded due to this damage. Using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), the damage was examined and found to have a thickness of 40 nm of amorphous silicon. This thin damage layer was effectively removed in an acid mixture solution. The combined process of laser doping and etch back is called the laser etch back process. After removal of this thin damage layer, the cell efficiencies were significantly improved up to 19.17%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Periodic hexagonal unit cell silicon nanohole (SiNH) structures with different structural dimensions have been fabricated using polystyrene spheres and investigated in terms of their microstructures and optical reflectance. Compared with a planar Si wafer, such structures exhibit much lower reflectance due to the enhanced scattering introduced by the SiNHs. Optical simulation using the finite element method has also been carried out in order to optimize the structural periodicity and hole diameter for maximum light absorption. The optimum structure is found to have a periodicity of 693 nm and hole diameter of 560 nm, and it yields the highest ultimate efficiency of 28.8%.

AB This article presents a simple and effective method of functionalizing hydrogen-terminated silicon (Si) nanocrystals (NCs) to form a high-quality colloidal Si NC ink with short ligands that allow charge transport in nanocrystal solid films. Si NCs fabricated by laser-pyrolysis and acid etching are passivated with allyl disulfide via ultraviolet (UV)-initiated hydrosilylation to form a stable colloidal Si NC ink. Then a Si NC-based photodiode is directly fabricated in air from this ink. Only a solution-processed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) electron blocking layer and top- and bottom-contacts are needed along with the Si NC layer to construct the device. A Schottky-junction at the interface between the Si NC absorber layer and aluminum (Al) back electrode drives charge separation in the device under illumination. The unpackaged Si NC-based photodiode exhibites a peak photoresponse of 0.02 A W-1 to UV light in air, within an order of magnitude of the response of commercially available gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium nitride (GaN), and silicon carbide (SiC) based photodetectors. This provides a new pathway to large-area, low-cost solution-processed UV photodetectors on flexible substrates and demonstrates the potential of this new silicon nanocrystal ink for broader applications in solution-processed optoelectronics.

AB Nanomaterials such as semiconductor nanowires have unique features that could enable novel optoelectronic applications such as novel solar cells. This paper aims to demonstrate one such recently proposed concept: Monolithically Integrated Laterally Arrayed Multiple Band gap (MILAMB) solar cells for spectrum-splitting photovoltaic systems. Two cells with different band gaps were fabricated simultaneously in the same process on a single substrate using spatially composition-graded CdSSe alloy nanowires grown by the Dual-Gradient Method in a chemical vapor deposition system. CdSSe nanowire ensemble devices tested under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination achieved open-circuit voltages up to 307 and 173 mV and short-circuit current densities as high as 0.091 and 0.974 mA/cm(2) for the CdS- and CdSe-rich cells, respectively. The open-circuit voltages were roughly three times those of similar CdSSe film cells fabricated for comparison due to the superior optical quality of the nanowires. I-V measurements were also performed using optical filters to simulate spectrum-splitting. The open-circuit voltages and fill factors of the CdS-rich subcells were uniformly larger than the corresponding CdSe-rich cells for similar photon flux, as expected. This suggests that if all wires can be contacted, the wide-gap cell is expected to have greater output power than the narrow-gap cell, which is the key to achieving high efficiencies with spectrum-splitting. This paper thus provides the first proof-of-concept demonstration of simultaneous fabrication of MILAMB solar cells. This approach to solar cell fabrication using single-crystal nanowires for spectrum-splitting photovoltaics could provide a future low-cost high-efficiency alternative to the conventional high-cost high-efficiency tandem cells.

AB Iron pyrite (FeS2) nanostructures are of considerable interest for photovolatic applicaitons due to improved material quality compared to their bulk counterpart. As an abundant and nontoxic semiconductor, FeS2 nanomaterials offer great opportunities for low-cost and green photovoltaic technology. This paper describes the fabrication of FeS2 nanowire arrays via sulfurization of iron oxide nanotubes at relatively low temperatures. A facile synthesis of ordered iron oxide nanotubes was achieved throught anodization of iron foils. Characterization of the iron sufide nanowires indicates that pyrite structures were formed. A prototype FeS2 nanowire photoconductor demonstrates very high responsivity (>3.0 A/W). The presented method can be further explored to fabricate various FeS2 nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanoflowers, and nanoplates.

AB Incorporation of nanostructures is a recent trend in the photovoltaic community, aimed at improving light absorption and consequently cell efficiency. In this regard, semiconductor nanowires provide an attractive research platform for a new generation of cost-effective and efficient solar cells. Thanks to their unique geometry, silicon nanowires enhance light trapping and anti-reflection effects by means of multiple scattering between individual nanowires, and by coupling the light into confined eigenmodes over a broad range of the solar spectrum. Moreover, radial junction solar cells built around nanowires decouple the light absorption and carrier collection directions, which allows for a higher internal field and better carrier collection. Thus, arrays of radial junction solar cells bring advantages of high efficiency with reduced material amount. This is particularly attractive for devices based on hydrogenated amorphous and microcrystalline silicon thin films. In this paper, after reviewing different approaches to fabricate silicon nanowires, we focus on nanowires grown using the plasma-assisted vapour-liquid-solid method because of the simplicity and compatibility with current silicon thin-film technology. Their application to a-Si : H based radial junction solar cells has already resulted in similar to 8% of stable devices with an absorber layer thickness of only 100 nm. Moreover, current challenges and perspectives such as the use of a microcrystalline silicon absorber are also reviewed.

AB The transfer of chemical vapor deposited graphene is a crucial process, which can affect the quality of the transferred films and compromise their application in devices. Finding a robust and intrinsically clean material capable of easing the transfer of graphene without interfering with its properties remains a challenge. We here propose the use of an organic compound, cyclododecane, as a transfer material. This material can be easily spin coated on graphene and assist the transfer, leaving no residues and requiring no further removal processes. The effectiveness of this transfer method for few-layer graphene on a large area was evaluated and confirmed by microscopy. Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and four-point probe measurements. Schottky-barrier solar cells with few-layer graphene were fabricated on silicon wafers by using the cyclododecane transfer method and outperformed reference cells made by standard methods.

AB The integration of periodic back reflectors into thin-film solar cells offers the potential to accurately control the scattering behavior and improve the absorption enhancement in active layers, thereby overcoming the inherent performance limitations imposed by their poor light absorption and carrier collection. Periodically textured metal electrodes were therefore fabricated using a unique sauna-like method, and were investigated both experimentally and theoretically In this way, we confirm the effectiveness of tuning the geometric parameters and the corresponding surface morphology on enhancing the diffraction behavior and light absorption through rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. Furthermore, the periodically textured metal electrodes produced by this unique fabrication process provide a means of enhancing absorption in the tong wavelength range, thus opening a new way to further improve the performance of thin-film solar cells.

SO MICRO & NANO LETTERS

ID FEMTOSECOND LASER-PULSES; BLACK SILICON; SOLAR-CELLS
AB A 'black silicon' (BS) surface with low reflectance was fabricated by a standard pulsed deep reactive etching technology at room temperature. Aiming for a better understanding, a systematic experiment was conducted by varying the etching window size and bias power duty cycle. The samples were measured and analysed by a scanning electron microscope, the Bruker Optical Profiler and a UV-3400 spectrometer. It was observed that a broad scale range of the surface structures formed on the surface. With the duty cycle at 0.5, only about 100 nanometre scale replicable silicon cones formed on the surface, but as the duty cycle decreased to 0.25, the height of the silicon forest sharply increased to about 10 mu m, leading to a low reflectance of 0.9% in the visible range for the surface. To clarify the reason for this trend, the bias effective voltage (BEV) was measured and it was confirmed that the BEV would decrease from 100 to 47 V with the duty cycle adjusted from 1 to 0.25. This suggested that this decrease in BEV leads to a reduction of ion energy and ion flux, and then modifies the fabricated structures. Besides, it was found that the broad etching window area only had a maximum promotion of 20% to the scale of the BS, indicating this method was almost free of loading effect.

AB Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells consisting of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) film deposited on a crystalline silicon wafer have attracted considerable attention from the photovoltaic industry, because of their high efficiencies, high stabilities, low cost, and low-temperature fabrication. Texturing of silicon surfaces is an effective method for improving the efficiency of silicon solar cells. In this work, textured silicon substrates consisting of three different pyramidal structures were obtained using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution, and used to fabricate SHJ solar cells. We investigated the influence of different pyramidal structural morphologies on the optical properties and electronic performances, to identify the optimum structure for SHJ solar cells. We obtained a standard silicon substrate with four-sided pyramidal structures using 2% (w) TMAH and 10% (w) isopropyl alcohol (IPA). In comparison with other pyramidal structures, the standard four-sided pyramidal-structured silicon substrate had the lowest reflectance, leading to an increased short-circuit current density (J(sc)), and its morphology is suitable for surface passivation and SHJ solar cells.

AB Fabricating thin film solar cells (TFSCs) on flexible substrates will not only broaden the applications of solar cells, but also potentially reduce the installation cost. However, a critical challenge for fabricating flexible TFSCs on flexible substrates is the incompatibility issues between the thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties of these substrates and the fabrication conditions. Transfer printing methods, which use conventional substrates for the fabrication and then deliver the TFSCs onto flexible substrates, play a key role to overcome these challenges. In this review, we discuss the basic concepts and working principles of four major transfer printing methods associated with (1) transfer by sacrificial layers, (2) transfer by porous Si layer, (3) transfer by controlled crack, and (4) transfer by water-assisted thin film delamination. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for implementing these methods for practical solar cell manufacture.
