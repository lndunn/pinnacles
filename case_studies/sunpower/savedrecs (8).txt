AB Inverted pyramids were fabricated through a method combining cesium chloride (CsCl) self-assembly technology and anisotropy corrosion of silicon solar cells. Ti film with nanoporous masks was formed by lift-off the CsCl nanoislands for the inverted pyramids. The pyramids were then formed by anisotropy corrosion of alkaline solution. The average diameter and morphology of the pyramids were controlled by varying the average diameter of CsCl nanoislands from 400 nm to 1.5 mu m and by varying the etching time of alkaline solution from 2 to 8 min. The inverted-pyramid texture could suppress reflection to below 10% at wavelengths from 400 to 1000 nm, which was much lower than that of planar wafer. A solar cell fabricated from the pyramids had higher short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) compared with those of planar solar cells for the good antireflection property. The solar cell showed a PCE of 15.25%, a J(sc) of 38.35 mA/cm(2), and an open-circuit voltage of 555.7 mV. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using a Xe-arc flashing of 0.4 ms, indium tin oxide (ITO) thin-films widely applied to fabricate transparent conducting electrodes for solar cells and displays are annealed at room temperature in order to improve their electric conductance and Optical transmittances. ITO thin-films of 100 nm in thickness are deposited on a glass substrate of 500 mu m in thickness by the magnetron sputtering method. Ray-tracing calculation estimates that heat absorbed in the thin-film during flash lamp annealing (FLA) process with using an additional back-reflector increases by about 2.8 times greater than that without using the back-reflector. Simulation based on one-dimensional conduction/radiation heat transfer model shows that the film temperatures during the FLA process exceed the crystallization point of the ITO material, indicating that its physical properties have been varied accordingly. Undergoing the short experimental FLA process, resistivity of the specimen has been decreased by about 30%, which is comparable to the ones obtained from conventional furnace annealing at temperatures ranging 200-300 degrees C for an hour, while the transmittances in the visible light range have been slightly increased. Morphological features of the films are investigated using XRD, XPS, AFM, and SEM, indicating that the specimens treated by the FLA or in furnace have crystallites larger than that of the as-received.

AB In this study, we demonstrate a solar cell design based on horizontally aligned microwires fabricated from 99.98% pure silicon via the molten core fiber drawing method. A similar structure consisting of 50 mu m diameter close packed wires (approximate to 0.97 packing density) on a Lambertian white back-reflector showed 86 % absorption for incident light of wavelengths up to 850 nm. An array with a packing fraction of 0.35 showed an absorption of 58 % over the same range, demonstrating the potential for effective light trapping. Prototype solar cells were fabricated to demonstrate the concept. Horizontal wire cells offer several advantages as they can be flexible, and partially transparent, and absorb light efficiently over a wide range of incident angles.

AB A direct printing method for fabricating devices by using metal oxide transfer layers instead of conventional transfer media such as polydimethylsiloxane is presented. Metal oxides are not damaged by organic solvents; therefore, electrodes with gaps less than 2 mu m can be defined on a metal oxide transfer layer through photolithography. In order to determine a suitable metal oxide for use as transfer layer, the surface energies of various metal oxides are measured, and Au layers deposited on these oxides are transferred onto polyvinylphenol (PVP). To verify the feasibility of our approach, Au source-drain electrodes on transfer layers and Si nanowires (NWs) addressed by the dielectrophoretic (DEP) alignment process are transferred onto rigid and flexible PVP-coated substrates. Based on transfer test and DEP process, Al2O3 is determined to be the best transfer layer. Finally, Si NWs field effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated on a rigid Si substrate and a flexible polyimide film. As the channel length decreases from 3.442 to 1.767 mu m, the mobility of FET on the Si substrate increases from 127.61 +/- 37.64 to 181.60 +/- 23.73 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Furthermore, the fl exible Si NWs FETs fabricated through this process show enhanced electrical properties with an increasing number of bending cycles.

AB Photodetectors with a wide spectrum response are important components for sensing, imaging, and other optoelectronic applications. A molybdenum oxide (MoO3-x)/Si heterojunction has been applied as solar cells with great success, but its potential in photodetectors has not been explored yet. Herein, a self-powered, high-speed heterojunction photodetector fabricated by coating an n-type Si hierarchical structure with an ultrathin hole-selective layer of molybdenum oxide (MoO3-x) is first investigated. Excellent and stable photoresponse performance is obtained by using a methyl group passivated interface. The heterojunction photodetector demonstrated high sensitivity to a wide spectrum from 300 to 1100 nm. The self-powered photodetector shows a high detectivity of (similar to 6.29 x 10(12) cmHz(1/2) W-1) and fast response time (1.0 mu s). The excellent photodetecting performance is attributed to the enhanced interfacial barrier height and three-dimensional geometry of Si nanostructures, which is beneficial for efficient photocarrier collection and transportation. Finally, our devices show excellent long-term stability in air for 6 months with negligible performance degradation. The thermal evaporation method for large-scale fabrication of MoO3-x/n-Si photodetectors makes it suitable for self-powered, multispectral, and high-speed response photodetecting applications.

AB Within the context of reducing production costs, thin (<90 pm) silicon foils intended for photovoltaic applications have been fabricated from standard (100)Si wafers using a lowtemperature (<150 C) stress-induced lift-off process. A multi-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) study was performed in order to evaluate, at atomic scale, the quality of the material in terms of defects, including identification and quantification. Generally, a complex ESR spectrum is observed, disentangled as the superposition of three separate signals. This includes, most prominently (-91% of total density) the D-line (Si-3  Si. dangling bonds in a disordered Si environment), a set (-6%) of highly anisotropic signals ascribed to dislocations (K1 -like), and a triplet, identified as the Si-5L5 N-donor defect. Defect density depth profiling from the lift-off side shows all signals disappear in tandem after etching off a 33 pm thick Si layer, indicating a highly correlated equal in relative terms distribution of the three types of defects over the affected top part of the Si foil. The defect density is found to be highly non-uniform laterally, with the density peaking near the crack initiation point, from which defect generation spreads. It is thus found that the SLIM-Cut method for fabrication of thin Si foils results in the introduction of defects that would unacceptably impair the functionality of photovoltaic cells built on these substrates. Fortunately, this may be cured by etching off a thin top Si layer, resulting in a most useful thin Si foil of standard high quality.

AB Enhancing the absorption of thin-film microcrystalline silicon solar cells over a broadband range in order to improve the energy conversion efficiency is a very important challenge in the development of low cost and stable solar energy harvesting. Here, we demonstrate that a broadband enhancement of the absorption can be achieved by creating a large number of resonant modes associated with two-dimensional photonic crystal band edges. We utilize higher-order optical modes perpendicular to the silicon layer, as well as the band-folding effect by employing photonic crystal superlattice structures. We establish a method to incorporate photonic crystal structures into thin-film (similar to 500nm) microcrystalline silicon photovoltaic layers while suppressing undesired defects formed in the microcrystalline silicon. The fabricated solar cells exhibit1.3 times increase of a short circuit current density (from 15.0mA/cm(2) to 19.6mA/cm(2)) by introducing the photonic crystal structure, and consequently the conversion efficiency increases from 5.6% to 6.8%. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the absorption characteristics in the fabricated cell structure, and reveal that the energy conversion efficiency can be increased beyond 9.5% in a structure less than 1/400 as thick as conventional crystalline silicon solar cells with an efficiency of 24%.

AB Porous silicon layers (PSLs) were prepared by electrochemical etching with different etching current densities 10, 20 and 30 mA/cm(2) on the front side of n(+) p Si junctions. The formed porosity was determined gravimetrically within a good range of 88.27-97%. The effect of porosity on the structure, electrical, and photoelectrical properties was investigated. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows the evolution of PSLs morphology through the increase in surface area due to the regular increase in porosity. The optical reflectance measurements were obtained by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment, which reveals that the textured cells with PS layer structures have lower reflectivity value compared to the textured cell without PS structure. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of Al/PS/n(+) p/Al junction fabricated at etching current density of 30 mA/cm(2) were investigated and compared with the reference Al/n(+) p/Al junction. The junction parameters such as series resistance (R-S), ideality factor (n) and effective barrier height (phi(b)) were determined by using different methods. Under illumination, the short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and the open-circuit voltage (V-OC) increased from 0.35 mA/cm(2) to 53 mA/cm(2) and from 0.39 V to 0.62 V, respectively. The photosensitivity of PSLs solar cells showed a noticeable enhancement in quantum efficiency of the PS cells by increasing the porosity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The highly doped emitter and BSF are in direct contact to each other (p(+)n(+) junction) leading to a controlled junction breakdown at low reverse-bias voltages of around 5 V. The breakdown was located at the p(+)n(+) junction and found to be homogeneously distributed over the whole cell area. This is not critical for module integration as the absolute temperature rise of a reverse-biased cell was determined to be less than 35 K. After reverse breakdown, the conversion efficiency degraded by 1-2% absolute due to additional recombination at the p+n+ junction. The cell performance could be fully recovered by a short annealing at 300 degrees C indicating that the Al2O3 passivation was altered by the reverse breakdown. This might be a fundamental issue for Al2O3 passivated IBC solar cells without gap between emitter and BSF, independent from the doping method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, electroluminescent (EL), eddy current (EC) technology, and I-V measurements were used to analyze the soldering-induced damages on crystalline silicon solar modules fabricated by hot-air soldering method. Experimental results reveal that the most common defects, in the order of occurrence frequency, are cracks, gridfinger interruption at busbar (GFIB), and floating solders. High thermal stress is the main cause for the cracks and GFIB, which mostly appear close to the region of silver paste. Floating solder is often observed in a soldering process using materials with high melting temperatures such as lead-free solders. Both GFIB and floating solder induce obvious power degradation. Although floating solder is not easily identified in an EL image, it can be detected by using the EC method. The tensile tests reveal that if more floating solders occur in a sample group, then these samples also show lower tensile strength. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate a new class of silicon texturing approach based on inorganic (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and organic (tetramethylammonium hydroxide, TMAH) alkaline liquor etching processes for photovoltaic applications. The first stage of inorganic alkaline etching textures the silicon surface rapidly with large pyramids and reduces the cost. The subsequent organic alkaline second-etching improves the coverage of small pyramids on the silicon surface and strip off the metallic contaminants produced by the first etching step. In addition, it could smoothen the surface of the pyramids to yield good morphology. In this study, the texturing duration of both etching steps was controlled to optimize the optical and electrical properties as well as the surface morphology and passivation characteristics of the silicon substrates. Compared with traditional inorganic NaOH texturing, this hybrid process yields smoother (111) facets of the pyramids, fewer residual Na+ ions on the silicon surface, and a shorter processing period. It also offers the advantage of lower cost compared with the organic texturing method based on the use of only TMAH. We applied this hybrid texturing process to fabricate silicon heterojunction solar cells, which showed a remarkable improvement compared with the cells based on traditional alkaline texturing processes.

AB The successful fabrication of high-performance flexible thin film solar cells (TFSCs) directly on diverse substrates is intrinsically limited by the processing temperature and substrate property. In this work, a colloidal transfer-printing (CTP) method is developed to fabricate large-area flexible thin-film absorbers with an antireflection coating and periodic configurations. Compared with a planar film, such structures exhibit much lower reflectance due to the antireflection introduced by the textured polydimethylsiloxane and the enhanced scattering introduced by the periodic back-scattering reflector. Optical simulation using the finite-element method indicates the structural periodicity for maximum light absorption is of 300 nm for an ultrathin amorphous silicon (a-Si) film with a thickness of 160 nm. The patterned a-Si film yields an overall absorption of 64.8%, which is much larger than the planar counterpart of 38.5%. This new approach to thin-film transfer can be readily extended to other material systems and device structures, opening up an effective alternative to traditional fabrication of the low-cost and high-performance optoelectronic devices.

AB In this work, the use of a high bandgap perovskite solar cell in a spectrum splitting system is demonstrated. A remarkable energy conversion efficiency of 23.4% is achieved when a CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell is coupled with a 22.7% efficient silicon passivated emitter rear locally diffused solar cell. Relative enhancements of >10% are demonstrated by CH3NH3PbBr3/CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3/multicrystalline-screen-printed-Si spectral splitting systems with tandem efficiencies of 13.4% and 18.8%, respectively. The former is the first demonstration of an all perovskite split spectrum system. The CH3NH3PbBr3 cell on a mesoporous structure was fabricated by the vapor-assisted method while the planar CH3NH3PbI3 cell was fabricated by the gas-assisted method. This work demonstrates the advantage of the higher voltage output from the high bandgap CH3NH3PbBr3 cell and its suitability in a tandem system.

AB The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of a solar cell fabricated by a simple electrophoretic method with a planar transparent hybrid of graphenes (GPs) and single wall carbon nanotubes (SCNTs)/n-type silicon heterojunction was significantly increased compared to GPs/n-Si and SCNTs/n-Si solar cells. The power conversion efficiency was increased by more than 1.6 fold compared to SCNTs or GPs fabricated solar devices. The performance improvement of the hybrid photovoltaic device can mainly be attributed to the increase of the conductivity of the hybrid transparent film. Further improvement was achieved by doping the hybrid film with Au nanoparticles, and the power conversion efficiency can be increased to 8.8%. The fabrication processes are simple, low cost and fit for scaling. The results demonstrate that planar transparent hybrid of GPs/SCNTs/n-Si heterojunction is efficient for solar energy conversion and is promising for light harvesting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We report on the structural and optoelectronic characteristics and photodetection properties of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film/silicon (Si) nanowire heterojunction diodes. A simple and cost-effective metal-assisted etching (MAE) method is applied to fabricate vertically oriented Si nanowires on n-type single crystalline Si wafer. Following the nanowire synthesis, CdTe thin films are directly deposited onto the Si nanowire arrays through RF magnetron sputtering. A comparative study of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy shows the improved crystallinity of the CdTe thin films deposited onto the Si nanowires. The fabricated nanowire based heterojunction devices exhibit remarkable diode characteristics, enhanced optoelectronic properties and photosensitivity in comparison to the planar reference device. The electrical measurements revealed that the diodes have a well-defined rectifying behavior with a superior rectification ratio of 10(5) at +/- 5 V and a relatively small ideality factor of n = 1.9 with lower reverse leakage current and series resistance at room temperature in dark condition. Moreover, an open circuit voltage of 120 mV is also observed under illumination. Based on spectral photoresponsivity measurements, the nanowire based device exhibits a distinct responsivity (0.35-0.5 A W-1) and high detectivity (6 x 10(12)-9 x 10(12) cm Hz(1/2) W-1) in near-infrared wavelength region. The enhanced device performance and photosensitivity is believed to be due to three-dimensional nature of the interface between the CdTe thin film and the Si nanowires. The device characteristics observed here reveals that fabricated CdTe thin film/Si nanowire heterojunctions are promising for high-performance and low-cost optoelectronic device applications, near-infrared photodetectors in particular.

Important diode parameters, such as the Schottky barrier height, ideality factor, and series resistance, are extracted from forward bias current-voltage characteristics using a previously established method modified to take into account the interfacial native oxide layer present at the graphene/silicon junction. It is found that the ideality factor can be substantially increased by the presence of the interfacial oxide layer. Furthermore, low frequency noise of graphene/silicon Schottky junctions under both forward and reverse bias is characterized. The noise is found to be 1/f dominated and the shot noise contribution is found to be negligible. The dependence of the 1/f noise on the forward and reverse current is also investigated. Finally, the photoresponse of graphene/silicon Schottky junctions is studied. The devices exhibit a peak responsivity of around 0.13 A/W and an external quantum efficiency higher than 25%. From the photoresponse and noise measurements, the bandwidth is extracted to be similar to 1 kHz and the normalized detectivity is calculated to be 1.2 x 10(9) cm Hz(1/2) W-1. These results provide important insights for the future integration of graphene with silicon device technology. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB In the past 60 years' development of photovoltaic semiconductors, the number of component elements has increased steadily, i.e., from silicon in the 1950s, to GaAs and CdTe in the 1960s, to CuInSe2 in the 1970s, to Cu(In, Ga) Se-2 in the 1980s, to Cu2ZnSnS4 in the 1990s, and to recent Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)(4) and CH3NH3PbI3. Whereas the material properties become more flexible as a result of the increased number of elements, and multinary compound semiconductors feature a dramatic increase of possible point defects in the lattice, which can significantly influence the optical and electrical properties and ultimately the photovoltaic performance. It is challenging to characterize the various point defects and defect pairs experimentally. During the last 20 years, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have offered an alternative method of overcoming the difficulties in experimental study, and widely used in predicting the defect properties of semiconductors. Compared with the available experimental methods, the first-principles calculations are fast, direct and exact since all possible defects can be investigated one by one. This advantage is especially crucial in the study of multinary compound semiconductors which have a large number of possible defects. Through calculating the formation energies, concentration and transition (ionization) energy levels of various possible defects, we can study their influences on the device performance and then identify the dominant defects that are critical for the further optimization of the performance. In this paper, we introduce the first-principles calculation model and procedure for studying the point defects in materials. We focus on the hybrid scheme which combines the advantages of both special k-points and Gamma-point-only approaches. The shortcomings of the presentcalculation model are discussed, with the possible solutions proposed. And then, we review the recent progress in the study of the point defects in two types of multinary photovoltaic semiconductors, Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)(4) and H3NH3PbI3.
   The result of the increased number of component elements involves various competing secondary phases, limiting the formation of single-phase multinary compound semiconductors. Unlike ternary CuInSe2, the dominant defect that determines the p-type conductivity in Cu2ZnSnS4 is Cu-on-Zn antisite (CuZn) defect rather than the copper vacancy (V-Cu). However, the ionization level of CuZn is deeper than that of V-Cu. The self-compensated defect pairs such as [2CuZn + SnZn] are easy to form in Cu2ZnSnS4, which causes band gap fluctuations and limits the V-oc of Cu2ZnSnS4 cells. Additionally the formation energies of deep level defects, SnZn and V-S, are not sufficiently high in Cu2ZnSnS4, leading to poor lifetime of minority carriers and hence low V-oc. In order to enhance the formation of V-Cu and suppress the formation of CuZn as well as deep level defects, a Cu-poor/Zn-rich growth condition is required. Compared with Cu2ZnSnS4, the concentration of deep level defects is predicted to be low in Cu2ZnSnSe4, therefore, the devices fabricated based on the Se-rich Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)(4) alloys exhibit better performances.
   Unlike Cu2ZnSnS4 cells, the CH3NH3PbI3 cells exhibit rather high V-oc and long minority-carrier life time. The unusually benign defect physics of CH3NH3PbI3 is responsible for the remarkable performance of CH3NH3PbI3 cells. First, CH3NH3PbI3 shows that flexible conductivity is dependent on growth condition. This behavior is distinguished from common p-type photovoltaic semiconductor, in which the n-type doping is generally difficult. Second, in CH3NH3PbI3, defects with low formation energies create only shallow levels. Through controlling the carrier concentration (Fermi level) and growth condition, the formation of deep-level defect can be suppressed in CH3NH3PbI3. We conclude that the predicted results from the first-principles calculations are very useful for guiding the experimental study.

AB The efficiency of organometal trihalide perovskites (OTP) solar cells have reached that parity of single crystal silicon, and its nature abundant raw material and solution-process capability promise a bright future for commercialization. However, the vacuum based techniques for metal electrode deposition and additional encapsulation layer increase the cost of the perovskite solar cells dramatically and impede their commercialization process. Here, we report a vacuum-free low temperature lamination technique to fabricate the top electrode by commercial conductive tapes (C-tape). The simple fabrication method yields good quality contact and high efficiency device of 12.7%. The C-tapes also encapsulated the devices effectively, resulting in greatly improved device stability. The combination of lamination of electrodes and encapsulation layers into a single step significantly reduce the cost of device fabrication. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the evolution of photovoltaic cells in together with flexible electronics rapidly grows up so as to satisfy the flexibility and elasticity needs. Therefore, it will be a breakthrough impact if it is able to develop flexible single-crystalline photovoltaic cells which are fabricated with traditional procedure and provide highly electrical properties as well. This study aims to fabricate the flexible solar photovoltaic device with practical and reproducible method. Generally, the flexible solar photovoltaic is manufactured on the 30 gm-thickness single-crystalline silicon chip by chemical etching process. Versatile design on the flexible device can enhance light trapping effect. The surface texturization and antireflection layer deposition successfully minimize the reflectivity losses from the incident light. In addition, the developed devices under concave bending morphology demonstrates better operating performance than convex and flat configurations. As to the concave bending type, the significant improvement of power conversion efficiency (129% better than flat type, and 161% better than convex type) is observed from a large device current, which is related to the contribution of light trapping enhancement. In combination of all optimal conditions, the flexible device exhibits conversion efficiency up to 13.8%. The development of novel flexible solar photovoltaics with the excellent mechanical flexibility, low silicon material consumption and low fabrication cost demonstrates the potential capability for future solar cells.

AB In the frame of the development of thin crystalline silicon solar cell technologies, surface nanopatterning of silicon is gaining importance. Its impact on the material quality is, however, not yet fully controlled. We investigate here the influence of surface nanotexturing on the series resistance of a contacting scheme relevant for thin-film crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells. Two-dimensional periodic nanotextures are fabricated using a combination of nanoimprint lithography and either dry or wet etching, while random pyramid texturing is used for benchmarking. We compare these texturing techniques in terms of their effect on the series resistance of a solar cell through a study of the sheet resistance (R-sh) and contact resistance (R-c) of its front layers, i.e., a sputtered transparent conductive oxide and evaporated metal contacts. We have found by four-point probe and the transfer length methods that dry-etched nanopatterns render the highest R-sh and Rc values. Wet-etched nanopatterns, on the other hand, have less impact on Rc and render Rsh similar to that obtained from the nontextured case.

AB In this work, a double-layer Al metallization scheme for large-area photodiodes is presented. This scheme combines a self-alignment of two separate layers of sputtered Al with an anodic Al2O3 as the intermediate insulating layer. One initial patterning step, that could be performed litho-less by for example laser ablation, was needed to define and etch cavities. The cavities provided two Si levels, each of which was contacted by one of the metal layers. Measurement results of test structures showed the effectiveness of this metallization scheme. Despite being partially anodized, the underlying Al layer remained a good conducting layer, with normal low-ohmic behavior. The anodized Al2O3 layer itself acted as a good insulating layer and the two metal layers were not shorted. Furthermore, the characteristics of diodes formed in the textured cavity were as ideal as the planar counterparts. The large two-dimensional coverage of both the anode and cathode by separate metal layers is a promising configuration for low series resistance. Moreover, all steps involved are available on standard integrated circuit (IC) processing equipment, and Al is an abundant cheap metal, making this a very low-cost method of fabricating contacts to large-area devices.

AB A simple, inexpensive method for fabricating a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) film using thermal chemical vapor deposition from cyclopentasilane (CPS) at atmospheric pressure with a substrate temperature of 370 degrees C is described. The reactant gas was generated from liquid CPS by vaporization in the deposition chamber. The vaporized CPS gas was transformed immediately into a-Si: H film on a heated substrate. The a-Si: H films could be doped either n- or p-type by dissolving appropriate amounts of white phosphorus or decaborane, respectively, in the liquid CPS before vaporization. This process allows deposition of doped a-Si: H films of photovoltaic device-quality without the need for handling, storage, or transportation of large amounts of gaseous reactants.

AB We report herein on the effects of silicon nanowire with different morphology on the device performance of n-SiNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the SiNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells can be optimized by varying the length of the silicon nanowires. The optimal length of silicon nanowires is 0.23 mu m, and the hybrid solar cell with the optimal length has the V-oc of 569 mV, J(sc) of 30.1 mA/cm(2), and PCE of 9.3 %. We fabricated more isolated silicon nanowires with the diluted etching solution. And the J(sc) of the hybrid solar cell with more isolated nanowires has a significant enhancement, from 30.1 to 33.2 mA/cm(2). The remarkable EQE in the wavelength region of 300 and 600 nm was also obtained, which are in excess of 80 %. Our work provides a simple method to substantially improve the EQE of hybrid solar cell in the short wavelength region.

AB To improve the competitiveness of solar cells, cell efficiency must increase and use of materials must be minimized. Light trapping measures can achieve this by allowing cells to absorb a greater fraction of the incident light. Traditional methods like surface texturing can negatively impact the cell's electrical characteristics and are generally unsuited to thin cell types. A plasmonic light trapping structure that avoids such issues can be formed using self-assembled hexagonal arrays of dielectric nanospheres in a continuous metal layer, at the rear surface of a cell. This can be easily fabricated toward the end of cell production, making it suitable for implementation with various solar cell types. 3D finite-difference time-domain simulations were conducted to investigate the potential of such structures, varying parameters including feature size and spacing, metal and absorber material and thickness, and the impact of random variations in the array. Significant improvements were found for a variety of topographies, with a peak increase in photocurrent from 2 mu m silicon of 4.02 mA/cm(2) or 24.4%, relative to the case of a standard rear mirror with a 100 nm SiO2 spacer layer. This also compares favorably to arrays of rear metal nanoparticles that previously yielded promising experimental results. We also identified critical parameters to control when designing such structures. A particular advantage of this structure is that it can offer light trapping advantages similar to those provided by metal nanoparticle arrays while still being able to serve as the rear contact of the cell due to the continuity of the metal layer.

AB In this study, epitaxial layers of GaAs-based solar cells were grown on Si substrates using a molecular beam epitaxial system. The pyramid-like via hole recessed electrode structure was fabricated on the back side of the Si substrate to improve the performance of the resulting solar cells. Since the current path was effectively reduced by the via hole recessed structure, the associated series resistance and the carrier recombination loss of the resulting GaAs/Si solar cells were decreased. Consequently, the conversion efficiency enhancement of 21.8% of the GaAs/Si solar cells with the via hole recessed structure was obtained due to the improvement in the short-circuit current density and the fill factor compared with the conventional GaAs/Si solar cells.

AB In order to reliably extract metal silicon interface recombination parameters to aid optimization of silicon wafer solar cell designs, a test metallization pattern with regions of varying front metal contact fractions is screen printed to create special test cells, alongside solar cells with a standard H-pattern print. Both the test pattern and H-pattern cells are analyzed using intensity-dependent photoluminescence imaging (Suns-PL), and the H-pattern cells are additionally probed at each busbar to monitor their open-circuit voltage (via Suns-V-oc measurements). The resultant data are analyzed in two ways, the first being a simple four parameter graphical fitting to the Suns-PL plots of the regions of interest, and the second being a detailed finite element method (FEM) based simulation and numerical fitting. By accounting for the lateral balancing currents in the FEM based simulation, test patterns with imaginary isolation across the edges of the mini cells could be used, which were the easiest to fabricate. The FEM method is more rigorous and is able to replicate simultaneously the Suns-PL characteristics of both test pattern and H pattern cells, using a common set of recombination parameters.

AB New techniques to form honeycomb textures on multicrystalline silicon surfaces for enhanced light capture in solar cells are frequently reported. This paper investigates the optical properties of such textures fabricated by inkjet patterning and compares the inkjet-patterned honeycomb-textures to planar surfaces and the more conventional, industrial iso-textures. A novel geometrical modelling method that uses matrices to describe the angular distribution of light as it interacts with the silicon surface was used to simulate the absorption and optical losses for silicon wafers using the three morphologies on their front surface. The inkjet-fabricated textures were demonstrated to result in enhanced absorption over planar surfaces, and to perform at least as well as industrial iso-textures for cell structures with a rear diffused reflector and with a rear surface with unity specular internal reflection. Options for further performance improvements and advantages over iso-textures are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We applied an epitaxial n(+)-type Si emitter layer grown on a p-type Si substrate by our environmentally-light-load sputter epitaxy method using RF magnetron sputtering without dopant activation annealing for a Si solar cell. We also applied low-temperature cleaning of the substrate with a hydrogen-fluoride treatment at room temperature prior to the emitter layer growth instead of the conventionally used high-temperature thermal cleaning under vacuum condition. In addition, by our sputter epitaxy method, we determined the optimum temperature for the emitter growth. An emitter layer with good crystallinity is obtained, and the solar cell, formed with an emitter layer grown at the optimum growth temperature of 410 degrees C, exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of 12.3% in 100% aperture ratio equivalent without a texture or an antireflection coat. By the above low-temperature processes, a solar cell can be fabricated with process temperatures below 410 degrees C, which exhibits low temperature processes.

AB On the basis of perfect PC2D simulation to the measured current density vs voltage (J-V) curve of the best selective emitter (SE) solar cell fabricated by the CSG Company using the screen printing phosphoric paste method, we systematically investigated the effect of the parameters of gridline, base, selective emitter, back surface field (BSF) layer and surface recombination rate on performance of the SE solar cell. Among these parameters, we identified that the base minority carrier lifetime, the front and back surface recombination rate and the ratio of the sheet-resistance of heavily and lightly doped region are the four largest efficiency-affecting factors. If all the parameters have ideal values, the SE solar cell fabricated on a p-type monocrystalline silicon wafer can even obtain the efficiency of 20.45%. In addition, the simulation also shows that fine gridline combining dense gridline and increasing bus bar number while keeping the lower area ratio can offer the other ways to improve the efficiency.

AB Recently, excellent surface passivation has been achieved for both p- and n-type silicon solar cells using AlOx/SiNx:H stacks deposited by atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. However, alternative materials and deposition methods could provide practical options for large-scale manufacturing of commercial solar cells. In this study we demonstrate that AlOx/AlNx stacks fabricated by reactive radio-frequency magnetron sputtering can provide fairly good surface passivation (S-max of similar to 30 cm/s) regardless of AlOx thickness, which is found to be due to the high negative fixed charge density (Q(eff) of -2.8 x 10(12) cm(-2)) and moderately low interface trap density (D-it of 2.0 x 10(11) eV(-1).cm(-2)). The stacks also show fairly good antireflection performance in the visible and near-infrared spectral region. The demonstrated surface passivation and antireflection performance of in situ reactively sputtered AlOx/AlNx stacks make them a promising candidate for a surface-passivating antireflection coating on silicon solar cells.

AB A low-environmental-load single-crystal Si solar-cell fabrication method was demonstrated, in which SiNx:H anti-reflection film was formed using a pulsed-DC reactive sputtering method with Ar and a forming gas (FG: 3.8% H-2 in N-2), and an n(+) emitter was created using thermal diffusion of diluted phosphoric acid. In the SiNx: H film, it was shown that both exposure of the Si surface to FG plasma and FG annealing of the SiNx:H film dramatically decreased the surface recombination velocity, S, of the Si substrate, because of an improved Si/SiNx:H interface. The interface state density was found to be 2.1 x 10(11) cm(-2).eV(-1) and the minimum S was 72 cm.s(-1); these values are comparable to those obtained using the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. The characteristics of the fabricated solar cells were: a short-circuit current of 38.1 A.cm(-2), open-circuit voltage of 594.6V, fill factor of 73.8, and an energy conversion efficiency of 16.7%.

AB We studied the effects of incorporation of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) nanoparticles (clusters) generated in the initial discharge phase on light induced degradation of a-Si:H films. The amount of clusters incorporated into the films in the initial discharge phase is 15 times larger than that in the steady state. To evaluate the effects of such initial cluster incorporation on stability of a-Si:H films, we fabricated a-Si:H Schottky cells with and without initial cluster incorporation using a multi-hollow discharge plasma chemical vapor deposition method with a shutter and compared cell stability against light exposure. The degradation ratio of the cell without initial cluster incorporation is less than 1% even after 100 hour light soaking of 2.7 suns. Our results show that suppressing initial cluster incorporation into a-Si:H films is a key to stable a-Si:H cells. Moreover, Si-H-2 bonds in films can be reduced down to 1/10 using a cluster eliminating filter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the mechanism of red shift in photoluminescence (PL) and reduction in the PL lifetime from Si nanocrystals (NCs) decorated on vertical Si nanowires (NWs) array due to ZnO over layer coating. Arrays of vertically aligned single crystalline Si NWs decorated with arbitrary shaped Si NCs have been fabricated by a silver assisted wet chemical etching method. A strong broad band and tunable visible to near-infrared PL is observed from these Si NWs at room temperature and the Si NCs on the surface of the Si NWs are primarily responsible for the PL emission. Higher band gap ZnO film is sputter deposited on the Si NCs decorated Si NWs to form heterostructure. Bare Si NW/NCs and Si NCs/ZnO heterostructures show extremely high broad band absorption in the entire visible region. PL studies on the Si NCs/ZnO heterostructures reveal significant red shift and in some cases reduced intensity of the PL band due to the ZnO layer in close proximity of the Si NCs. This is accompanied by a reduction in the PL lifetime of the Si NCs after ZnO coating. Interestingly, no measurable red shift in PL is observed in absence of the resonance in the visible PL emission energy of ZnO and that of Si NCs. The modified PL from the heterostructures is explained through an energy band diagram on the basis of resonant energy transfer from the defect assisted recombination of the carries in the ZnO overlayer that excites the Si NCs in the close proximity and subsequent de-excitation process via radiative recombination. These findings have important bearing on the development of cost effective Si-based hybrid optoelectronic devices using wide band gap heterostructured oxide semiconductors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report self-catalyzed growth of GaAs nanowires (NWs) on Si/SiOx patterns fabricated by a lithography-free method. The patterns are defined using droplet epitaxy of GaAs nanocrystals, spontaneous oxidation, and thermal annealing. We investigate the influence of the size and density of the nucleation sites on the NW growth process and show that this approach enables the fabrication of highly uniform GaAs NWs with controllable density. The pattern fabrication and NW growth process are studied and discussed in relation to the surface morphology and chemical properties of the Si/SiOx patterns. Furthermore, the optical quality of the NWs is investigated by photoluminescence experiments performed for GaAs-AlGaAs core-shell NWs.

AB Thin films with tunable porosity are of high interest in applications such as gas sensing and antireflective coatings. We report a facile and scalable method to fabricate ZnO electrodes with tuneable porosity. By adjusting the substrate temperature and ratio of precursor gasses during low-pressure chemical vapor deposition we can accurately tune the porosity of ZnO films, from 0 up to 24%. The porosity change of the films from dense layer to separated nanopillars results in an effective refractive index reduction from 1.9 to 1.65 at 550 nm, as determined by optical and x-ray spectroscopy. The low-refractive-index ZnO films are incorporated into amorphous silicon solar cells demonstrating reflection losses reduction down to 4% in the visible wavelengths range.

AB Silicon heterojunction solar cells critically depend on the detailed properties of their amorphous/crystalline silicon interfaces. We report here on the use of attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to gain precise insight into the vibrational properties of the surfaces and ultrathin layers present in such solar cells. We fabricate ATR prisms from standard silicon wafers similar to those used for device fabrication. In this fashion, we acquire very-high sensitivity FTIR information on device-relevant structures. Our method has no requirement for minimum layer thickness, enabling the study of the impact of the different fabrication process steps on the film microstructure. We discuss the necessary requirements for the method implementation and give a comprehensive overview of all observed vibration modes. In particular, we study vibrational signatures of Si-H-X, Si-H-X(SiYOZ), B-H, hydroxyl groups, and hydrocarbons on the Si(111) surface. We observe subtle effects in the evolution of the chemical state of the surface during sample storage and process-related wafer handling and discuss their effect on the electronic properties of the involved interfaces.

AB Purpose: To fabricate organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with nanometric active layers sensitive to ionizing radiation and measure their dosimetric characteristics in clinical x-ray beams in the diagnostic tube potential range of 60-150 kVp.
   Methods: Experiments were designed to optimize the detector's x-ray response and find the best parameter combination by changing the active layer thickness and the area of the electrode. The OPV cell consisted of poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl): [6,6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl ester photoactive donor and acceptor semiconducting organic materials sandwiched between an aluminum electrode as an anode and an indium tin oxide electrode as a cathode. The authors measured the radiation-induced electric current at zero bias voltage in all fabricated OPV cells.
   Results: The net OPV current as a function of beam potential (kVp) was proportional to kVp(-0.5) when normalized to x-ray tube output, which varies with kVp. Of the tested configurations, the best combination of parameters was 270 nm active layer thicknesses with 0.7 cm(2) electrode area, which provided the highest signal per electrode area. For this cell, the measured current ranged from approximately 0.7 to 2.4 nA/cm(2) for 60-150 kVp, corresponding to about 0.09 nA-0.06 nA/mGy air kerma, respectively. When compared to commercial amorphous silicon thin film photovoltaic cells irradiated under the same conditions, this represents 2.5 times greater sensitivity. An additional 40% signal enhancement was observed when a 1 mm layer of plastic scintillator was attached to the cells' beam-facing side.
   Conclusions: Since both OPVs can be produced as flexible devices and they do not require external bias voltage, they open the possibility for use as thin film in vivo detectors for dose monitoring in diagnostic x-ray imaging. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

AB We report on the hydrogen-assisted deep reactive ion etching of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films deposited using radio-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD). High aspect-ratio vertical and 3D amorphous silicon features, with the desired control over the shaping of the sidewalls, in micro and nano scales, were fabricated in ordered arrays. The suitable adhesion of amorphous Si film to the underlayer allows one to apply deep micro- and nano-machining to these layers. By means of a second deposition of amorphous silicon on highly curved 3D structures and subsequent etching, the fabrication of amorphous silicon rings is feasible. In addition to photolithography, nanosphere colloidal lithography and electron beam lithography were exploited to realize ultra-small features of amorphous silicon. We have also investigated the optical properties of fabricated hexagonally patterned a-Si nanowire arrays on glass substrates and demonstrated their high potential as active layers for solar cells. This etching process presents an inexpensive method for the formation of highly featured arrays of vertical and 3D amorphous silicon rods on both glass and silicon substrates, suitable for large-area applications.

AB Rutile-phase titanium dioxide nanorods (NRs) were synthesized successfully on p-type silicon (Si) (111), c-plane sapphire (Al2O3), glass coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), glass, and quartz substrates via chemical bath deposition method. All substrates were seeded with a TiO2 seed layer synthesized with a radio frequency reactive magnetron sputtering system prior to NRs growth. The effect of substrate type on structural, morphological, and optical properties of rutile TiO2 NRs was studied. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy analyses showed the tetragonal rutile structure of the synthesized TiO2 NRs. Optical properties were examined with photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the grown rutile NRs on all substrates, with the spectra exhibiting one strong ultraviolet emission peak intensity compared with broad visible peak. The optimal sample of rutile NRs was grown on Si substrate. Thus, a fast-response metal-semiconductor-metal ultraviolet (UV) detector was fabricated. Upon exposure to 365 nm light (2.3 mW/cm(2)) at 5 V bias, the device displays 2.62 x 10(-5) A photocurrent, and the response and recovery times are calculated as 18.5 and 19.1 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the fabricated high-quality photodiode is a promising candidate as a low-cost UV photodetector for commercially integrated photoelectronic applications.

AB High-performance electrodes are fabricated through supersonic spraying of nickel and copper particles. These electrodes yield low specific resistivities, comparable to electrodes produced by screen-printed silver paste and light-induced plating. The appeal of this fabrication method is the low cost of copper and large area scalability of supersonic spray-coating techniques. The copper and nickel electrode was fabricated in the open air without any pre- or post-treatment. The spray-coated copper nickel electrode was characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Although both SEM and TEM images confirmed voids trapped between flattened particles in the fabricated electrode, this electrode's resistivity was order 10(-6) Omega cm, which is comparable to the bulk value for pure copper.

AB Chemically-derived graphene have been synthesized by modified Hummers method and reduced using sodium borohydride. To explore the potential for photovoltaic applications, graphene/p-silicon (Si) heterojunction devices were fabricated using a simple and cost effective technique called spin coating. The SEM analysis shows the formation of graphene oxide (GO) flakes which become smooth after reduction. The absence of oxygen containing functional groups, as observed in FT-IR spectra, reveals the reduction of GO, i.e., reduced graphene oxide (rGO). It was further confirmed by Raman analysis, which shows slight reduction in G-band intensity with respect to D-band. Hall effect measurement confirmed n-type nature of rGO. Therefore, an effort has been made to simulate rGO/p-Si heterojunction device by using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance software, considering the experimentally derived parameters. The detail analysis of the effects of Si thickness, graphene thickness and temperature on the performance of the device has been presented.

AB In this paper, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films are deposited on glasses substrate by RF magnetron sputtering. The optical, electrical and morphological properties of AZO films textured by wet-etching with different etchants, H3PO4, HCl, and HNO3 are studied. It is found that the textured structure could enhance the light scattering and light trapping ability of amorphous silicon solar cells. The textured AZO film etched with HNO3 exhibits optimized optical properties (T% >= 80% over entire wavelength, haze ratio > 40% at 550 nm wavelength) and excellent electrical properties (rho = 5.86 x 10(-4) Omega cm). Scanning electron microscopy and Atomic force microscopy are used to observe surface morphology and average roughness of each textured AZO films. Finally, the textured AZO films etched by H3PO4, HCl and HNO3 were applied to front electrode layer for p-i-n amorphous silicon solar cells. The highest conversion efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cell fabricated on HNO3-etched AZO film was 7.08% with open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density and fill factor of 895 my, 14.92 mA/cm(2) and 0.56, respectively. It shows a significantly enhancement in the short-circuit current density and conversion efficiency by 16.2% and 20.2%, respectively, compared with the solar cell fabricated on as-grown AZO film.

AB Silicon solar cells with nanopore-type black silicon (b-Si) antireflection (AR) layers and self-aligned selective emitter (SE) are reported in which the b-Si structure is prepared without the traditional addition of a nanoparticle (NP) catalyst. The contact-assisted chemical etching (CACE) method is reported here for the first time, in which the metal top contacts on silicon solar cell surfaces function as the catalysts for b-Si fabrication and the whole etching process can be done in minutes at room temperature. The CACE method is based on the metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) solution but without or metal precursor in the Si etchant (HF:H2O2:H2O), and the Au top contacts, or catalysts, are not removed from the solar cell surface after the etching. The effects of etching time, HF and H2O2 concentration, and the HF:H2O2 ratio on the b-Si morphology, surface reflectivity, and solar cell efficiency have been investigated. Higher [HF] and [H2O2] with longer etching time cause collapse of the b-Si nanoporous structure and penetration of the p-n junctions, which are detrimental to the solar cell efficiency. The b-Si solar cell fabricated with the HF:H2O2:H2O volume ratio of 3:3:20 and a 3 min etch time shows the highest efficiency 8.99% along with a decrease of reflectivity from 36.1% to 12.6% compared to that of the nonetched Si solar cell.

AB Commercial production of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) polycrystalline films requires high electrical conductivity with minimal degradation in optical transparency. Aqueous solution deposited TCO films would reduce production costs of TCO films but suffer from low electrical mobility, which severely degrades both electrical conductivity and optical transparency in the visible spectrum. Here, we demonstrated that grain boundary modification by ultra-violet laser crystallization (UVLC) of solution deposited aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanocrystals results in high Hall mobility, with a corresponding dramatic improvement in AZO electrical conductance. The AZO films after laser irradiation exhibit electrical mobility up to 18.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) with corresponding electrical resistivity and sheet resistances as low as 1 x 10(-3) Omega cm and 75 Omega/sq, respectively. The high mobility also enabled a high transmittance (T) of 88%-96% at 550 nm for the UVLC films. In addition, HAZE measurement shows AZO film scattering transmittance as low as 1.8%, which is superior over most other solution deposited transparent electrode alternatives such as silver nanowires. Thus, AZO films produced by the UVLC technique have a combined figure of merit for electrical conductivity, optical transparency, and optical HAZE higher than other solution based deposition techniques and comparable to vacuumed based deposition methods.

AB A double textured selective emitter (DTSE) solar cell was fabricated using Si wafer. The 40 x 40 mm(2) silicon substrates were textured to form a pyramid-shaped surface, and nanowires were fabricated by a metal-assisted chemical etching process using Ag nanoparticles. All surface modifications of the micro and nanostructures were done by a wet-based process. The heavily doped and shallow emitters for selective emitter solar cells were prepared through the POCl3 diffusion and a chemical etch-back process, respectively. The front and rear electrodes were prepared with a conventional screen printing method. The optical properties were enhanced through the double textured (DT) structure, and additional enhancement of the electrical properties was realized through the selective emitter concept. The DTSE solar cell achieved a higher conversion efficiency of 17.9% with improved absorption and short circuit current density compared to a DT solar cell. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Printed electronics, in which microcircuit patterns are fabricated using printing methods, are the focus of considerable attention for the fabrication of devices such as flat panel displays, solar cells, and flexible electronics. In particular, gravure offset printing is considered to be a highly promising approach for rapid printing of fine patterns with well-controlled thickness. At present, however, because of the occurrence of side etching during fabrication of metal printing plates, features with dimensions of less than 10 mu m cannot be printed. In order to overcome this problem, we have previously proposed the use of a rubber printing plate fabricated by photolithography and molding, which is free from side-etching issues. However, deformation of the printing plate can have a detrimental influence on the transferred pattern. In the present study, we developed a method for visualizing the deformation of a printing plate containing both micropatterns and nanopatterns, in order to study its effect on the printing process. The results were compared with those predicted by an analytic equation under a uniform controlled pressure. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An n-InP/p-Si heterojunction photodiode fabricated by corrugated epitaxial lateral overgrowth (CELOG) method is presented. N-InP/p-Si heterojunction has been achieved from a suitable pattern containing circular shaped openings in a triangular lattice on the InP seed layer on p-Si substrate and subsequent CELOG of completely coalesced n-InP. To avoid current path through the seed layer in the final photodiode, semi-insulating InP: Fe was grown with adequate thickness prior to n-InP growth in a low pressure hydride vapor phase epitaxy reactor. The n-InP/p-Si heterointerface was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Room temperature cross-sectional photoluminescence (PL) mapping illustrates the defect reduction effect in InP grown on Si by CELOG method. The InP PL intensity measured above the InP/Si heterojunction is comparable to that of InP grown on a native planar substrate indicating low interface defect density of CELOG InP despite of 8% lattice mismatch with Si. The processed n-InP/p-Si heterojunction photodiodes show diode characteristics from the current-voltage (I-V) measurements with a dark current density of 0.324 mA/cm(2) at a reverse voltage of -1V. Under the illumination of AM1.5 conditions, the InP/Si heterojunction photodiode exhibited photovoltaic effect with an open circuit voltage of 180 mV, a short circuit current density of 1.89 mA/cm(2), an external quantum efficiency of 4.3%, and an internal quantum efficiency of 6.4%. This demonstration of epitaxially grown InP/Si heterojunction photodiode will open the door for low cost and high efficiency solar cells and photonic integration of III-Vs on silicon.

AB According to the Mie scattering theory, spheres with the size matched with light wavelength are most suitable for light scattering and enhance the light trapping ability. In this paper, a novel visible-light wavelength matched sphere assembly of TiO2 superfine nanorods was fabricated via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The morphology and the structure were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The visible subwavelength TiO2 microsphere resembling an immature chinese chestnut is composed of countless superfine TiO2 nanorods, the diameter of these building blocks of superfine TiO2 nanorods is similar to 5 nm. The obtained TiO2 sphere has an average diameter of ca. 450 nm, which matches well with the visible light wavelength and cause the effective light-scattering effect. Furthermore, these TiO2 superfine nanorods formed V-shaped structure which is usually designed in traditional silicon solar cells. Study show the as-prepared rutile TiO2 spheres has a good light-trapping property and an excellent photovoltaic performance. Even though the dye absorption is two times lower than that of the widely used anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, the obtained rutile sample shows a satisfactory energy conversion efficiency of 6.59% and is the highest PCE reported for intrinsic rutile TiO2. The further optimized DSSC shows a photo to electron conversion efficiency of 8.3%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
