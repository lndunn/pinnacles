AB This paper considers texturing of ZnO:Ga (GZO) films used as back contacts in amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film solar cells. GZO thin films are first prepared by conventional methods. The as-deposited GZO surface properties are modified so that their use as back contacts on a-Si solar cells is enhanced. Texturing is performed by simple dry plasma etching in a CVD process chamber,at power=100 W, substrate temperature=190 degrees C (temperature is held at 190 degrees C because thin film solar cells are damaged above 200 degrees C), pressure=400 Pa and process gas H(2) flow=700 sccm. Conventional a-Si solar cells are fabricated with and without GZO back contact surface treatment. Comparison of the with/without texturing GZO films shows that plasma etching increases optical scattering reflectance and reflection haze. SEM and TEM are used to evaluate the morphological treatment-induced changes in the films. Comparison of the a-Si solar cells with/without texturing shows that the plasma treatment increases both the short-circuit current density and fill factor. Consequently, a-Si solar cell efficiency is relatively improved by 4.6%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To apply surface plasmon effects to Si solar cells, thin polymer films containing nanoparticles of silver and gold were fabricated using the spin-coating method. Advantages of this method are that it is simple, and that there is no possibility to produce additional crystal defects as surface recombination centers. Thin polymer films showed an absorption peak, anti-reflection effect and the haze ratio increase. In particular, thin polymer films containing gold nanoparticles were promising for improving Si solar cells, because the film had the longest peak wavelength and the lowest reflectance (3.84% at 800 nm), overall haze ratio increase caused by localized surface plasmon. Enhancement ratio in photocurrent conversion efficiency was 12% for single-crystal Si solar cells after being spin-coated with a thin polymer film containing gold nanoparticles. Enhancement ratio of the external quantum efficiency was 22% at the peak wavelength, caused by antireflection due to scattering by metal nanoparticles.

AB To reduce cost and maintain viability of silicon-based solar cells for commercial applications, the absorption of thin silicon films, on the order of a few microns, must be enhanced. We are developing a method to increase absorption across the solar spectrum by exploiting the enhanced electric near field caused by surface modes of excited metallic particles. Previous research in the field has focused on deposition of these particles on a passivated Si surface, a technique that scatters light in directions lateral to the cell, but does not promote direct carrier generation, as the near field enhancement is too far from the Si itself. Consequently, we have developed a method using ion implantation and thermal evaporation to fabricate Ag nanoparticles below the Si surface, near the p-n junction, where the enhanced near field can greatly enhance the absorptive response of the silicon solar cell.

AB a method combining Csesium Chloride (CsCl) self-assembly and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching has been used to fabricate nanopillars with high aspect ratio structures on sillicon wafer. The silicon surface with nanopillars of average diameter 350nm and aspect ratios 4, like black wafer, has very low reflectivity at a width of light spectrum. After diffusion of phosphorus (P) and passivation of SiO2 layer on the pillars surface, the reflectivity has been reduced more to below 3% for wavelength from 400nm to 800nm, which could meet the requirement of antireflection for solar cells. What's more, the reflectivity of nanopillar surface could not obey the formula of reflection to increase with the incident angle of light like planar, and has almost unchanged small values at incident angle of 10 degrees-50 degrees. The solar cell with nanopillars has been fabricated with thermal diffusion of P, chemical deposion of Cu electrode with UV lithography. Its IxV output power of photoelectric property has been measured with sunlight at different time in one day corresponding to different incident angle, and measure of common solar cell is done at the same time for comparation. In order to select the inflection factor of incident angle, the data of output power have been united by dividing max value for nanopillar and common solar cells individually. The united curve of nanopillars cell shows obviously larger value than that of common cell at above incident angle of about 15 degrees, which means nanopillars cell could have the potential ability to offer more electric energy production daily than that of common solar cell.

   In this work we develop and study the first elaboration steps of high quality arrays of nanowires functionalized as solar cells using a radial junction. The core of the structure is made of a P-doped nanowire grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) using the Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS) method, and the shell is fabricated by a 2D conformal deposition of N-doped silicon layer by CVD. The resulting device is then a dense array of vertically aligned and functionalized silicon nanowires that presents interesting enhanced light absorption. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, we demonstrate a thorough device design, fabrication, characterization, and analysis of biomimetic antireflective structures implemented on a Ga0.5In0.5P/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell. The sub-wavelength structures are fabricated on a silicon nitride passivation layer using polystyrene nanosphere lithography followed by anisotropic etching. The fabricated structures enhance optical transmission in the ultraviolet wavelength range, compared to a conventional single-layer antireflective coating (ARC). The transmission improvement contributes to the enhanced photocurrent, which is also verified by the external quantum efficiency characterization of fabricated solar cells. Under one-sun illumination, the short-circuit current of a cell with a biomimetic structures is enhanced by 24.1% and 2.2% due to much improved optical transmission and current matching, compared to cells without an ARC and with a conventional ARC, respectively. Further optimizations of the biomimetic structures including the periodicity and etching depth are conducted by performing comprehensive calculations based on a rigorous couple-wave analysis method.

AB Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been put forward as a potential low-cost alternative to the widely used silicon solar cells, which are subject to cost limitations. However, some problems need to be solved in order to enhance the efficiency of DSCs. In particular, the electron recombination occurred by the contact between the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and a redox electrolyte is one of the main limiting factors of efficiency. Accordingly, a compact layer plays an important role in realizing highly efficient DSCs because it improves the adhesion of the TiO(2) to the TCO and provides a larger contact area and more effective electron transfer by preventing electron recombination. In this work, the fabrication of a TiO(2) compact layer using Ti sputter deposition and acid-treatment was investigated rather than the conventional method, which uses a TiCl(4) aqueous solution. The acid-treatment of the sputtered Ti film actively oxidized the Ti particles. As a result, such a cell exhibited an additional 1.3% in total efficiency compared to the standard DSC without a compact layer. These improvements are not inferior to those obtained by the conventional fabrication method using a TiCl(4) aqueous solution. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel method of combining photolithography, wet chemical etching and oxidation process was proposed to fabricate large area of silicon microwire (SiMW) arrays. The dimensions of the SiMWs can be easily controlled by photomask and etching conditions. Solar cells based on the heterojunction between SiMW and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) were constructed. The initial test on the DWNT/SiMW shows efficiency (eta) of 0.59%. By adding a few drops of HBr/B(2) electrolyte, the efficiency was improved to 1.96% with J (sc)=19.2 mA/cm(2) and V (oc)=0.35 V, FF=29.2%, showing the potential of SiMWs in photovoltaic applications.

AB Herein we demonstrate an improved metal-assisted etching method to achieve highly dense and uniform silicon nanowire arrays. A pre-surface treatment was applied on a silicon wafer before the process of metal-assisted etching in silver nitrate and hydrogen fluoride solution. The treatment made silver ion continuously reduce on silver nuclei adherence on the silicon surface, leading to formation of dense silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles acting as local redox centers cause the formation of dense silicon nanowire arrays. In contrast, an H-terminated silicon surface made silver ion reduce uniformly on the silicon surface to form silver flakes. The silicon nanowires fabricated with a pre-surface treatment reveals higher density than those fabricated without a pre-surface treatment. The volume fraction improves from 18 to 38%. This improvement reduces the solar-weighted reflectance to as low as 3.3% for silicon nanowires with a length of only 0.87 mu m. In comparison, the silicon nanowires fabricated without a pre-surface treatment have to be as long as 1.812 mu m to achieve the same reflectance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile method by combining bottom-up and top-down approaches was developed to construct uniform three-dimensional (3D) ZnO nanowires (NWs)/silicon microrod (SiMR) hybrid architectures. Patterned SiMR arrays with controlled geometry and density were structured by photolithography and chemical etching on single-crystal silicon wafers, which subsequently served as 3D scaffolds for the ZnO NW growth. In contrast to the top-down approach to fabricate Si M R scaffolds, the radial ZnO NWs grown conformally on the SiMRs follow a bottom-up method by employing a modified carbon-assisted self-catalytic growth via chemical vapor deposition. The light absorption and the photocatalytic capability of methyl red of ZnO NW arrays were demonstrated to improve significantly by the 3D constructions. The method is expected to be applicable to the synthesis of 3D hybrid structures of other nanomaterials. The heterojunction and ultralarge surface area of the 3D architectures are promising for diverse applications in photovoltaics, catalysts, and sensing.

AB The characteristics of optical absorption and photovoltaic properties of silicon(Si) wire solar cells with different aspect ratio have been studied. Vertically aligned Si wire arrays were fabricated by electrochemical etching and pen junction was prepared by spin-on-dopant (SOD) diffusion method. To demonstrate the effect of wire length, it was controlled with varying electrochemical etching time. We also investigated the optical properties of wire arrays with increasing wire length. 50-nm-thick Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO) film was used as a surface passivation and electrical contact layer that conformally deposited on the radial pen junction Si solar cell by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. We have observed efficiency enhancement with increasing wire length that increases the light trapping within the Si wire arrays, while the large surface area results in increased surface recombination. From the cell efficiency data, we identify that the surface recombination effect becomes more significant in the large surface area solar cells. To overcome this issue, we demonstrate the effect of a highly conformal AZO film grown by ALD to serve as surface passivation layer and top contact electrode. The conversion efficiency of the best sample is 7.1% and short circuit current (J(sc)) of 25.3 mA/cm(2) under 100 mW/cm(2) of air mass (AM) 1.5G illumination, when the Si wire length is 8 mu m with AZO coating. These results present that optimization of the wire length and surface passivation is necessary for silicon based solar cells prepared by electrochemical etching to enhance the solar cell energy conversion efficiency.

AB A method to fabricate low reflectivity poly- crystalline Si (poly-Si) surface structures for solar cells has been developed by use of catalytic activity of a metal film. Immersion of Si contacted with platinum (Pt) films in hydrogen peroxide plus hydrofluoric acid solutions results in etching of Si only in the contacted areas. When the Pt surface possesses a pyramidal structure, an inverted pyramidal structure is formed on Si (111) and poly- Si surfaces on which the conventional alkaline etching method cannot form mat-textured surfaces. Poly-Si surfaces with the inverted pyramidal structure possess a reflectivity lower than that of the mattextured surfaces on the Si (100) surfaces. (c) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

AB Polyaniline(PAni) doped with formic acid was synthesis by chemical polymerization method using ammonium persulphate as oxidizing agent. Polyaniline /n-silicon hetrojunction have been fabricated by spin coating of polyaniline onto n-type silicon substrates. I-V characteristic of these junction diode show rectifying behavior with rectifying ratio of about 100. The I-V characteristics of PAni/n-Si junction were measured at room temperature (303K) and after annulling at 363K. They are found to exhibit quality factors of 1.83 and 1.32, saturation current of 5x10(-6)A and 5x10(-4)A, and barrier heights of 0.73eV and 0.61eV respectively. The photovoltaic properties of this hybrid solar cell were studied in the dark and under illumination investigated hybrid and was found to deliver short circuit current density J(sc) =45 mu A/cm(2), open circuit voltage V(oc) = 400mV, and solar cell efficiency eta =0.3% under AM 1.5 simulated solar light with the intensity of 100mW/cm(2).

AB Three-dimensional (3D) ZnO-CuO core-shell nanorod arrays have been synthesized by a three-step process on silicon (100) substrates. A hydrothermal method was used to grow 3D ZnO nanorod arrays, followed by deposition of Cu nanofilm using sputtering, which was oxidized subsequently at 400 degrees C to form CuO shell surrounding ZnO nanorod core. The control over oxygen flow and pressure during the Cu nanofilm oxidation was found to improve the uniformity and intactness of CuO shell surrounding ZnO nanorod core. With higher oxygen flow, more conformal CuO thin film coating was achieved on the 3D ZnO nanorods array as a result of more sufficient oxygen access at the bottom portion of ZnO nanorods array. Higher pressure during thermal oxidation favored the formation of non-conformal ZnO-CuO core-shell nanorods and impurity Zn(2)SiO(4) possibly at the interface of ZnO and Si substrate. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy revealed higher absorption efficiency in the visible region in ZnO-CuO core-shell nanorods than in pure ZnO nanorods. The fabricated ZnO-CuO core-shell nanorods could be useful nanoscale building blocks in solar cells and light emitting devices.

AB We fabricated hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) solar cells on SnO2 coated glass using a seed layer insertion technique. Since rich hydrogen atoms from the mu c-Si:H deposition process degrade the SnO2 layer, we applied p-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (p-a-Si:H) as a window layer. To grow the pc-Si:H layer on the p-a-Si:H window layer, we developed a seed layer insertion method. We inserted the seed layer between the p-a-Si:H layer and intrinsic bulk mu c-Si:H. This seed layer consists of a thin hydrogen diluted silicon buffer layer and a naturally hydrogen profiled layer. We compared the characteristics of solar cells with and without the seed layer. When the seed layer was not applied, the fabricated cell showed the characteristics of a-Si:H solar cell whose spectral response was in a range of 400-800 nm. Using the seed layer, we achieved a mu c-Si:H solar cell with performance of V-oc=0.535 V, J(sc) =16.0 mA/cm(2), FF=0.667, and conversion efficiency = 5.7% without any back reflector. The spectral response was in the range of 400-1100 nm. Also, the fabricated device has little substrate dependence, because a-Si:H has weaker substrate selectivity than mu c-Si:H.

AB A nanoplasmonic biosensor chip with integrated electrical detection is presented. The concept is based on the local refractive index sensitivity of nanoplasmonic gold nanodisks (110 nm in diameter and 20 nm in height) that are fabricated, through a parallel method, directly on an array of silicon solar cells or photoactive diodes. The nanoplasmonic properties of the sensor chip were investigated both optically and electrically, with excellent agreement between the two. We show that local changes in the refractive index of the surrounding environment gives changes in the nanoplasmonic properties of the gold nanodisks, which induce corresponding changes in the photocurrent at single wavelengths of the nanoplasmonic solar cells. With a simple light-emitting diode as light source, and together with a material-specific modification protocol, the photocurrent output of the nanoplasmonic sensor chip was successfully used to monitor a specific biorecognition reaction in real-time.

ID PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS; SILICON; ABSORPTION
AB Vertically arrayed Si nanowire/nanorod-based core-shell p-n junction solar cells have been fabricated by a solid-state phosphorus diffusion to convert the shell of the boron-doped p-type Si nanowires to n-type, thus forming a core-shell p-n junction structure. The nanowires with a nanosphere defined diameter were fabricated by an Au-film assisted electrochemical etching method, enabling controlled junction formation. The Si nanowire arrays show superior optical properties over a wide range of spectrum. In addition, longer nanowires are more effective for light trapping and absorption which is more advantageous for efficient energy harvesting. The cells show a high energy conversion efficiency of 1.47%, a significant improvement from the previously reported Si nanowire-based core-shell junction solar cells where the core-shell junctions were formed by an oppositely doped Si deposition on preformed Si nanowires. The relatively high efficiency might be mainly attributed to the extremely low reflectivity of the nanowire arrays for efficient energy harvesting and a pristine junction formation by the diffusion method.

AB The use of laser doping in solar cell fabrication has received increased attention in recent years, especially due to its ability to form a selective emitter without subjecting the wafer to prolonged high-temperature processes. At the University of New South Wales, a laser doping method was developed that combines the formation of the selective emitter with a self-aligned metallization pattern. This letter reports 18.7% efficient laser-doped solar cells, fabricated on large area commercial-grade p-type Czochralski silicon, and analyzes the loss mechanisms.

AB We introduce a method combining cesium chloride self-assembly and inductively coupled plasma to fabricate nanopillars with uniform coverage over an entire 4 inch prepatterned silicon wafer. This method can produce pillars with average diameters ranging from 50 nm to 1.5 mu m, aspect ratios up to 13 and coverage ratios above 35%. Cesium chloride self-assembly utilizes the deliquescence of salt, with advantages of excellent tunability, high aspect ratio and potential for micro/nano mixed structures, which makes this technology promising in the areas of MEMS, solar cells, batteries, light emitting diodes, etc.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS

DT Article
ID SOLAR-CELLS; HYDROGEN; FUTURE
AB We report on a method based on ion implantation and thermal annealing to fabricate silicon surface textures for antireflection purposes. Modification to crystalline Si surfaces by hydrogen ion implantation is a well known phenomenon, but the surface structures generated by H implantation alone, typically of a low packing density and small aspect ratio, are not effective in suppressing light reflection from Si. We show that coimplantation of hydrogen and argon, combined with thermal annealing and oxidation, can result in an interesting surface morphology in Si crystals, yielding the lowest light reflectance of similar to 1% over a broad spectral range at various light incident angles. In addition, lattice damage to crystalline Si generated by ion implantation is reduced or completely removed by the annealing processes. Possible mechanisms for the formation of such observed surface textures are discussed. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3515842]

AB Cadmium sulphide (CdS) polycrystalline thin films were deposited on ultrasonically cleaned silicon wafers (1 0 0) by thermal evaporation technique in a vacuum of about 2 x 10(-5) Torr. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR). Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) were used to characterise the polycrystalline thin films. The thickness of the films as estimated by the ellipsometry, found to be in the range of 263-282 nm. The values of refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of thin films are found to decrease with wavelength. XRD results indicated the formation of cadmium sulphide thin films with hexagonal phase. The films have preferred orientation along (0 0 2) plane. The lattice parameters are calculated as a = 4.135 angstrom and c = 6.742 angstrom, which are in good agreement with the reported data. The optical properties of the polycrystalline thin films are investigated systematically by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and a blue shift compared with bulk cadmium sulphide is observed. The optical band gap of the thin film is estimated to be 2.50 eV. The structural and optical properties of the films fabricated by the thermal evaporation technique are found to be desirable for optoelectronic devices. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The LB technique allows one to control the alignment and the surface density of SWNTs by adjusting surface pressure of the film at the air-water interface. The aligned SWNT Langmuir films are successfully transferred onto the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or silicon substrate with unidirectional alignment, and SWNT patterns with various shapes arc fabricated on silicon and flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates by contacting and peeling off the PDMS stamp from the substrates via microcontact printing or lift-up methods. The SWNT patterning technique using the combination of soft lithography and the LB method can be applied in various fields, such as flexible high-speed transistors, high-efficiency solar cells, and transparent electrodes,

AB High-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (HF-PECVD) is a widely applicable method of deposition over a large area at a high rate for fabricating silicon thin-film solar cells. This investigation presents the properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films and the preparation of highly-efficient p-i-n solar cells using an RF (27.1 MHz) excitation frequency. The influence of the power (10-40 W) and pressure (20-50 Pa) used during the deposition of absorber layers in p-i-n solar cells on the properties and mechanism of growth of the a-Si:H thin films and the solar cells is studied. The a-Si:H thin films prepared under various deposition conditions have widely varying deposition rates, optical-electronic properties and microstructures. When the deposition parameters were optimized, amorphous silicon-based thin-film silicon solar cells with efficiency of 7.6% were fabricated by HF-PECVD. These results are very encouraging for the future fabrication of highly-efficient thin-film solar cells by HF-PECVD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogenated silicon films ranging from pure amorphous to biphasic i.e., nanocrystallites embedded amorphous silicon are prepared in an indigenously fabricated hot wire chemical vapor deposition chamber by varying the substrate temperature (Ts) and process pressure (PP). The deposition rates are found to be about 2.5-14 A/s, which is very much appreciated for the fabrication of cost effective devices. While the films deposited at low T-s are amorphous in nature, those deposited at T-s >= 200 degrees C contain nanocrystallites embedded in the amorphous network These mixed phase films show high crystalline fraction of 50-56%. All the films deposited at 250 degrees C, by varying PP, are nanocrystallite embedded with crystalline fraction 60-75%. The optical band gaps of the films (2.0-2.37 eV) are high compared to the regular films, whereas the hydrogen content remains in the reported range of 2.5-5 at.%. We attribute the high optical band gap to the improved order as well as the presence of low density amorphous tissues surrounding the grain boundary regions. The ease of depositing films with tunable band gap is useful for fabrication of tandem solar cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sub-wavelength antireflective structures are fabricated on a silicon nitride passivation layer of a Ga0.5In0.5P/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell using polystyrene nanosphere lithography followed by anisotropic etching. The fabricated structures enhance optical transmission in the ultraviolet wavelength range, compared to a conventional single-layer antireflective coating (ARC). The transmission improvement contributes to an enhanced photocurrent, which is also verified by the external quantum efficiency characterization of the fabricated solar cells. Under one-sun illumination, the short-circuit current of a cell with sub-wavelength structures is enhanced by 46.1% and 3.4% due to much improved optical transmission and current matching, compared to cells without an ARC and with a conventional SiNx ARC, respectively. Further optimizations of the sub-wavelength structures including the periodicity and etching depth are conducted by performing comprehensive calculations based on a rigorous couple-wave analysis method.

AB In this microreview, the recent progress on various synthetic methods for 1D semiconductor nanowires is summarized. The colloidal synthetic method has been popularly employed to prepare various semiconductor nanorods/nanowires such as ZnS and TiO(2). The vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) synthetic method has been used to fabricate Si and ZnO nanowires. For the growth of semiconductor nanowires by the VLS method, metals that can form a eutectic mixture with a target material have been used as catalysts. After the first report on the synthesis of crystalline III-V semiconductor nanowires by the solution-liquid-solid (SLS) method, various kinds of III-V and II-VI semiconductor nanowires have been synthesized by the SLS method. Various types of templates, including anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), sacrificial nanowire templates, and self-assembled surfactants, have been employed to fabricate 1D semiconductor nanowires that resemble the shape of the template employed. Using 1D semiconductor nanowires, high-performance photovoltaic cells can be fabricated due to facile electron transport within nanowires.

AB To replace the double layer antireflection coating and improve the efficiency of solar cell, a self assembled nickel nano particle mask followed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ion etching method is proposed to form the sub-wavelength structures (SWS) on silicon nitride (Si(3)N(4)) antireflection coating layers instead of semiconductor layer. The size and density of nickel nano particles can be controlled by the initial thickness of nickel film that is annealed to form the nano-particles on the Si(3)N(4) film deposited on the silicon substrate. ICP etching time is responsible for controlling the height of the fabricated Si(3)N(4) SWS on silicon substrate, which is seen from our experiment. It is found that the lowest average reflectivity of 3.12% for wavelength ranging from 350 to 1000 nm is achieved when the diameter and height of the SWS are 120-180 nm and 150-160 nm, respectively. A low reflectance below 1% is observed over the wavelength from 590 to 680 nm for the fabricated Si(3)N(4) SWS on silicon subs. The efficiency of Si(3)N(4) SWS could be improved by 1.31%, compared with the single layer anti-reflection (SLAR) coatings of Si(3)N(4), using PC1D program. The results of this study may benefit the fabrication of solar cells.

AB In this study, we present novel methods to texture the surface of GaAs substrates using the nanosphere lithography (NSL) technique that is based on arrays of SiO(2) nanospheres. Closed-packed arrays of SiO(2) nanospheres were formed on a benzocyclobutene (BCB) layer, followed by embedding SiO(2) nanospheres into the BCB layer. To texture the GaAs surface, three patterns were fabricated by nanosphere lithography. First, a convex pattern from the shape of the nanospheres was produced on the surface of GaAs. Second, a concave shape was produced on the surface of GaAs by additional wet etching to remove SiO(2) nanospheres. These two methods were found to be effective in reducing the reflectance to a range of 400-800 nm. Finally, the arrays of SiO(2) nanospheres were transferred onto the GaAs by dry-etching using a mixture of Cl(2) and BCl(3) gases, resulting in arrays of GaAs nanorods. The dry-etched surface structure showed the lowest reflectance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are a promising low-cost alternative to existing photovoltaic technologies such as crystalline silicon and thin inorganic films. The absorption spectrum of quantum dots (QDs) can be tailored by controlling their size, and QDs can be produced by low-cost methods. Nanostructures such as mesoporous films, nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes and nanosheets with high microscopic surface area, redox electrolytes and solid-state hole conductors are borrowed from standard dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) to fabricate electron conductor/QD monolayer/hole conductor junctions with high optical absorbance. Herein we focus on recent developments in the field of mono- and polydisperse QDSCs. Stability issues are adressed, coating methods are presented, performance is reviewed and special emphasis is given to the importance of energy-level alignment to increase the light to electric power conversion efficiency.

AB Development of devices that can be fabricated on amorphous substrates using multiple single-crystal semiconductors with different physical, electrical, and optical characteristics is important for highly efficient portable and flexible electronics, optoelectronics, and energy conversion devices. Reducing the use of single-crystal substrates can contribute to low-cost and environmentally benign devices covering a large area. We demonstrate a technique to harvest and transfer vertically aligned single-crystal semiconductor micro- and nanopillars from a single-crystal substrate to a low-cost carrier substrate while simultaneously preserving the integrity, order, shape, and fidelity of the transferred pillar arrays. The transfer technique facilitates multilayer process integration by exploiting a vertical embossing and lateral fracturing method using a spin-coated polymer layer on a carrier substrate. Electrical contacts are formed using a bilayer of metal and conducting polymer such as gold (Au) and polyaniline (PAni). In this method, the original single-crystal substrate can be repeatedly used for generating more devices and is minimally consumed, whereas in conventional fabrication methods, the substrate is employed solely as a mechanical support. This heterogeneous integration technique potentially offers devices with low physical fill factor contributing to lower leakage current and noise, reduced parasitic capacitance, and enhanced photon-semiconductor interactions, and enables heterogeneous multimaterial integration such as silicon with compound semiconductors for rapidly expanding large-scale applications, including low-cost and flexible electronics, displays, tactile sensors, and energy conversion systems.

AB We report on a simple and cost-effective method to fabricate high density silicon nanowires (SiNWs) through catalytic chemical wet etching. Metallic chromium/gold (Cr/Au) nanodots were first deposited onto the silicon wafer using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template. The AAO template was then removed before a thin blanket layer of gold catalyst was evaporated onto the sample surface. The gold-assisted chemical wet etching was carried out in a solution consisting of deionized water, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrofluoric acid to produce well-aligned silicon nanowires of uniform diameters. We demonstrate that the diameter of the silicon nanowires can be precisely controlled to a precision of 10 nm in the range of 40 to 80 nm through fine-tuning of the pore diameter of the AAO template. The reported fabrication procedure therefore gives a highly repeatable method to form well-aligned, uniform, and crystalline SiNWs of high density with controllable diameters below 100 nm. The use of Cr/Au as a hard mask blocking material will also be of great interest for the fabrication of other Si nanostructures using the catalytic etching process.

AB Nowadays, nanoporous films are widely employed in biochemical applications or in opto-photonic devices such as displays, solar cells, or light-guiding systems. In particular, the technological feasibility of nanoporous layers with low refractive indices has recently enabled the development of high-efficiency anti-reflection coatings. In this paper, we report on hybrid polymer nanoporous films that can be fabricated in a single coating step with an industrial aqueous-based method on very large surfaces. Both high transparency and low refractive index are simultaneously achieved over the entire visible spectrum. We eventually demonstrate the potential of such films for broadband AR applications by combining them in a graded-index multilayer that reduces the surface reflectivity of a polymer substrate from 10% to few parts per thousand.

AB A polycrystalline silicon (Si) wafer was grown directly from liquid Si. There are three requirements to achieve a Si wafer applicable for solar cells. One is that the Si wafer must have a sharply edge-defined quadrangular shape with a good surface morphology. The others are that the Si wafer must have a good microstructure and low-end impurity concentrations. A Si wafer with size of 50 x 50 mm was successively grown using a new horizontal growth method. The thickness of the as-grown wafer was approximately 375 +/- 50 mu m and that of a wafer with both sides polished was about 300 mu m. Using Ar gas blowing, the grown wafer was quenched. In addition, the liquid Si residue On the surface of the wafer was effectively removed to enhance the surface morphology. The maximum growth velocity to continuously grow the Si wafer was 1280 cm/min. From investigations of the microstructures, randomly shaped grains with an average size of 50.22 mu m were grown vertically from the bottom to the top of the wafer. This columnar grain structure should be beneficial for solar-cell applications because the horizontal grain boundaries are major recombination sites for generated charge carriers. However, defects, such as dislocations, twins, pores and impurities, such as SiC and carbon particles, were detected. There were also contamination with metal impurities, such its Al, Ca, Ni, and at several ppmw, and a relatively high concentration of oxygen. The direct growth process for a Si wafer used in this study could be a good candidate for a new technology to fabricate Si wafers for use in solar cells due to the good shape properties and the high growth velocity. However, the microstructure must, be improved, and further impurity control is needed.

AB Heterojunction between polyaniline (PANI) and porous silicon (PS) was fabricated by making a layer of PAN! on PS, using spin coating method. PS was fabricated by electrochemical etching process. PS was characterized by photoluminescence (PL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) while the PANI was characterized by FTIR and absorption (UV-VIS) spectroscopy. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements were done to determine the electrical properties of the heterojunction structure. The ideality factor of the heterojunction was found to be 4.2, which was considered high due to large defect density at the interface. Built-in potential was measured by both I-V and C-V and was found to be Phi(b(I-V)) = 0.41 V and Phi(b(C-V)) = 0.28 V respectively. The discrepancy in the values of the built-in potential was discussed. Band discontinuity in conduction band and valence band were found to be 0.65 and 1.27 eV respectively. Solar response of the heterojunction was also observed at AM (air mass) 1.0 and it showed a promising behavior as a photovoltaic device. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A metal grids-based texturization approach of monocrystalline silicon wafers with sodium carbonate solution is proposed. Using this etching process a low reflectance of silicon surface can be obtained for solar cells and the cost is lower than conventional texturization process. In the present work metal grids with suitable openings are used to capture hydrogen bubbles and remove them from the silicon surface, which are created due to the texturing reaction and stuck on silicon surface to prevent the texturing process. The reflectivity, the surface morphology and the etching rate are used to evaluate this texturization method. The influences of the size of the openings and the separation between grids and wafers on reflectance are studied. Under optimized conditions, uniform pyramids are fabricated. An average reflectance of 10.7% is obtained without any anti-reflectance coating. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrated a method of fabricating antireflective coatings based on the self-assembly of supramolecular block copolymer formed by polystyrene terminated with carboxyl (PS-COOH) and poly(methyl methacrylate) terminated with amine (PMMA-NH(2)) via hydrogen bonding. Different porous films were generated by selectively removing PS-COOH from the spin-coated films with a selective solvent, cyclohexane, under different conditions. The refractive index of such porous film can be tuned from 1.49 down to 1.26 by controlling the thickness of the porous film. For the porous layer with n similar to 1.26, the light transmittance of the glass about 97.93% was achieved in the visible range (lambda similar to 574 nm). By varying the solution concentration and exposing time in cyclohexane, inhomogeneous three-layered porous films were generated: top and bottom layers with high porosities and the middle layers with lower porosities, respectively. The light transmittance of the glass coated with this inhomogeneous film was about 98.00% in the near-infrared region corresponding to wavelength between 800 and 1400 nm. The wavelength region of the broadband antireflective films with high transmittance more than 99.00% can be fine tuned to 1200-2000 nm with increasing the film thickness.

AB Hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) film has been widely used as an emitter p layer in solar cells. For the better p layer, wide optical bandgap, and high electrical conductivity should be obtained from the effective method. We prepared the boron-doped a-SiC:H thin films using inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition (ICP-CVD) method and characteristics on the small-area (2 cm x 2 cm) as well as the large-area films (diameter of 100 mm) were shown on it. As a substrate, the n-type (100) oriented CZ c-Si (5.5 similar to 6.5 Omega . cm, 650 mu m) wafers were used and cleaned by using the reduced RCA method. A silane (SiH(4)) of 99.999% purity, H(2) and 60% hydrogen diluted ethylene (C(2)H(4)) was used as source gas for the deposition of intrinsic a-SiC:H films, and then diborane (B(2)H(6)), as the doping gas, is added to C(2)H(4) and SiH(4)/H(2) during the deposition of films. The uniformity of thickness and optical bandgap from large-area as-dep. films was at 1.8% and 0.3%, respectively. Heterojunction solar cell with 2 wt%-AZO/p-a-SiC:H/i-a-Si:H/c-Si/Ag structure was fabricated and characterized with diameter of 152.3 mm in this large-area ICP-CVD system. Conversion efficiency of 9.123% was achieved with a practical area of 100 mm x 100 mm, which can show the potentials to the fabrication of the large-area solar cell using ICP-CVD method.

AB A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has been considered as a strong alternative to conventional photovoltaic devices based on semiconductors such as silicon or compound semiconductors. The barrier layer functioned by the use of an electrode consisting of two different conduction band potentials is very effective in increasing the photovoltaic performance of a DSC. Especially, zinc oxide (ZnO) is very effective as a barrier layer because it has a higher energy level of the conduction band than TiO(2) and good contact with TiO(2) and dye molecules. We tried to fabricate the ZnO barrier layer using zinc acetate aqueous solution by the dip-coating method, although ZnO film is usually fabricated by chemical vapor deposition or sputter deposition. The experimental parameters were optimized to achieve an effective ZnO barrier layer. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction pattern were measured to analyze the ZnO layer. The photovoltaic performance of a completed DSC with an optimized ZnO barrier layer was measured and compared with that of a conventional DSC. Consequently, a DSC with a ZnO barrier layer had an increased V(OC) up to 0.85V and an enhanced efficiency of 4.05%.

AB The interconnection of solar cells is a critical part of photovoltaic module fabrication. In this paper, a high-yield, low-cost method for interconnecting polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass is presented. The method consists of forming adjacent, electrically isolated groves across the cells using laser scribing, and then forming wire bonds over each laser scribe, resulting in series interconnection of the individual solar cells. Wire bonds are also used to connect the first and last solar cell in the string to external (tabbing) leads, forming a mini-module. A layer of white paint is then applied, which acts as both an encapsulation layer and an additional back surface reflector. Using this method, an 8.3% efficient mini-module has been fabricated. By exploiting recent developments in wire bonding technology, it appears that this process can be automated and will be capable of forming solar cell interconnections on large-area modules within relatively short processing times (similar to 10 min for a 1 m(2) module).

Both the deposition rate and the dark-conductivity of the p-mu c-Si:H thin films drop down when the substrate temperature decreases. XRD and Raman measurements are used to characterize the micro-structure of p-mu c-Si:H thin films prepared at different substrate temperature. Grain size of p-mu c-Si:H thin films with different thickness as a function of substrate temperature has been investigated. Amorphous silicon thin film solar cells with p-i-n structures were fabricated on deposited boron doped mu c-Si:H layers. The best cells performance is obtained for p-layers processed at 90 degrees C.

AB Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) having curved structures may have unique advantages in device fabrication. However,, no methods are available to prepare curved SiNWs controllably. in this work, we report the preparation of three types of single-crystal SiNWs with various turning angles via metal-assisted chemical etching using (111)-oriented silicon wafers near room temperature. The zigzag SiNWs are single crystals and can be p- or n-doped using corresponding Si wafer as substrate. The controlled growth direction is attributed to the preferred movement of Ag nanoparticles along < 001 > and other directions in Si wafer. Our results demonstrate that metal-assisted chemical etching may be a viable approach to fabricate SiNWs with desired turning angles by utilizing the various crystalline directions in a Si wafer.

AB Thin-film structures can reduce the cost of solar power by using inexpensive substrates and a lower quantity and quality of semiconductor material. However, the resulting short optical path length and minority carrier diffusion length necessitates either a high absorption coefficient or excellent light trapping. Semiconducting nanowire arrays have already been shown to have low reflective losses compared to planar semiconductors, but their light-trapping properties have not been measured. Using optical transmission and photocurrent measurements on thin silicon films, we demonstrate that ordered arrays of silicon nanowires increase the path length of incident solar radiation by up to a Factor of 73. This extraordinary light-trapping path length enhancement factor is above the randomized scattering (Lambertian) limit (2n(2)similar to 25 without a back reflector) and is superior to other light-trapping methods. By changing the silicon film thickness and nanowire length, we show that there is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination; for nanowire arrays fabricated from 8 mu m thick silicon films, the enhanced absorption can dominate over surface recombination, even without any surface passivation. These nanowire devices give efficiencies above 5%, with short-circuit photocurrents higher than planar control samples,

AB We present a simple method to fabricate I polymer optical sheet with antireflection and antifogging properties. The method consists of two consecutive steps: photocross-linking of UV-curable polyurethane acrylate (PUA) resin and reactive ion etching (RIE). During photopolymerization, the cured PUA film is divided into two domains of randomly distributed macromers and oligomers due to a relatively short exposure time of 20 s at ambient conditions. Using the macromer domain as an etch-mask, dry etching was Subsequently carried out to remove the oligomer domain, leaving behind a nanoturf surface with tunable roughness. UV-vis spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that transmittance of a nanoturf surface is enhanced up to 92.5% as compared to a flat PUA surface (89.5%). In addition, measurements of contact angle (CA) reveal that the etched surface shows superhydrophilicity with a CA as small as 5 degrees. To seek potential applications, I-V characteristics of I thin film organic solar cell were measured under various testing conditions. It is shown that the efficiency call be increased to 2.9% when a nanoturf film with the surface roughness of 34.73 nm is attached to indium tin oxide (ITO) glass. More importantly, the performance is maintained even in the presence of water Owing to superhydrophilic nature of the film.

ID FILM SOLAR-CELLS; IMPROVED PERFORMANCE
AB Thin-film CuIn(Se,S)(2) (i.e., CIS) absorbers have been solution-deposited using a hydrazine-based approach that offers the potential to significantly lower the fabrication cost for CIS solar cells. In this method, metal chalcogenides are completely dissolved in hydrazine, forming a homogeneous precursor solution. Film deposition is demonstrated by spin-coating of the precursor solution onto various substrates, including Mo-coated glass and thermally oxidized silicon wafers. Using this approach, no postdeposition anneal in a toxic Se or S-containing environment is needed to obtain CIS Films. Instead, only a simple heat-treatment in an Inert atmosphere is required, resulting in CIS films with good crystallinity. Bandgap tuning call readily be achieved by varying the amount of S incorporated into the film. Complete CIS devices with glass/Mo/CIS/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO structure are fabricated using absorbers produced via this hydrazine-based approach. Air Mass 1.5G power conversion efficiencies of as high as 12.2% have been achieved, demonstrating that this new approach has great potential as a low-cost alternative for high-efficiency CIS solar cell production.

AB Silicon nanowires fabricated by the VLS method were n-doped with phosphine during their growth. The doping level was controlled by tuning the P/Si ratio in the CVD reactor during the synthesis. We observed that the growth rate of silicon nanowires was dopant dependent and that even the doping level of the substrate Could play a poisoning role. The nanowires were characterized before and after thermal activation by scanning Spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) in a vertical structure directly on their growth Substrate, showing that thermal activation led to a significant decrease of the resistance. SSRM is a simple AFM-mode-based technique that allows Lis to characterize in a short time a large number of individual nanowires and to correlate their dimensions to their electrical properties. Complementary techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy were also used for the characterization of the n-doped silicon nanowires.
