AB We developed a new Pb-free Ag paste with a SnO-P2O5 glass frit for front contact electrodes of crystalline silicon solar cells. First, we synthesized SnO-P2O5 glass frits with various compositions, whose glass transition temperatures were 225-245 degrees C, by using a melt-quenching method. It was experimentally verified that the glass component SnO etched through the silicon nitride anti-reflection coating on the Si emitter. Then, four kinds of Ag pastes with various SnO-P2O5 glass frits were prepared, screen-printed on a Si emitter, and fired to fabricate solar cells. The composition of the SnO-P2O5 glass frit affected the surface and interfacial morphology and microstructure of sintered Ag grids, which played an important role in the series resistance and photovoltaic properties of the solar cells. It was worth noting that the cells fabricated with SnO-based Ag pastes revealed no glass layer at the interface between the Ag grids and Si emitter. This differed from cells fabricated with Ag pastes containing Pb- or Bi-based glass frits. The highest efficiency of 7.2% was achieved for cells fabricated with the Ag paste containing 67SnO-33P(2)O(5) (mol%) glass frit at a firing temperature of 950 degrees C and a time of 5 min. This was because this Ag paste possessed the densest structure and lowest interfacial contact resistance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tungsten oxide (WOx) can be incorporated into amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells as hole contact and for interface modification between p-type amorphous silicon and indium tin oxide. This paper aims at understanding the influence of tungsten oxides properties on silicon heterojunction solar cells. Using in -system photoelectron spectroscopy on thermally evaporated WOx layers, it was verified that WOx with a stoichiometry close to WO3 features a work function close to 6 eV and is therefore suitable as hole contact on silicon. Additionally the oxygen vacancy concentration in WOx was measured using photoelectron spectroscopy. High oxygen vacancy concentrations in WOx lead to a low band bending in the WOx/silicon-junction. Furthermore solar cells were fabricated using the same WOx, and the band bending in these cells is correlated with their fill factors (FF) and open circuit voltages (V-OC) Combining these results, the following picture arises: positively charged oxygen vacancies raise the Fermi -level in WOx and reduce the band bending at the WOx/silicon-junction. This, in turn, leads to reduced V-OC and FF. Thus, when incorporating WOx into silicon solar cells it is important to minimize the oxygen vacancy density in WOx. Therefore deposition methods, enabling adjustment of the WOx stoichiometry are preferable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Boron doped nc-Si:H/a-SiC:H quantum dot superlattice (QDSL) has a great potential to improve thin film silicon solar cells performance for high conductivity, wide band gap and anti-reflection effect. In this study p-type nc-Si:H/a-SiC:H QDSL has been fabricated by in situ grown method without subsequent annealing treatment. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and PL peak energy shift indicate that this method provides the possibility to precisely control the size of silicon quantum dots and the passivation at well/barrier interface. By optimizing structural characteristics and interface passivation, high perpendicular conductivity and strong anti-reflection effect was simultaneously obtained in QDSL films. An initial efficiency of 10.5% was achieved for n-i-p type hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell, which may guide further efforts arising the structure engineering of nc-Si:H/a-SiC:H QDSL for high efficient solar cells.

AB In this paper, an effective and low cost method of texturization was introduced into the fabrication process for industrial multicrystalline silicon solar cell production. The purpose of the method was to reduce reflectance by creating a honeycomb-like textured surface using a masked wet etching process. A negative photoresist film was selected as an etching mask. Although large surface roughness of wafer was considered to affect the adhesion and acid resistance of etching mask, a honeycomb-like textured surface with a pitch of 18 mu m was fabricated successfully. The etched pits had a nearly smooth spherical segment surface, an average aperture of 15.1 mu m, and a depth of 6.5 mu m. This regular textured surface had a low light reflectivity of approximately 20.5% and greatly increased the carrier lifetime. Compared with multicrystalline silicon solar cells textured by conventional acid etching, the average short circuit current increased by 2.2% and the average efficiency increased from 17.41% to 17.75%, a net gain of 0.34%. And a high throughput above 2400 pieces per hour was obtained. This texturing technique is expected to promote the application of diamond-wire cut multicrystalline silicon wafers with the low saw-damage in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Absorption depth profile, a deterministic and key factor that defines the quality of excitons generation rate in optoelectronic devices, is numerically predicted using finite different time domain analysis. A typical model, nanoparticles array on silicon slab, was devised considering the concept of plasmonic solar cell design. The trend of spectral absorption depth profile distributions at various wavelengths of the solar spectrum, 460 nm, 540 nm, 650 nm, 815 nm, and 1100 nm, was obtained. A stronger and well-distributed absorption profile was obtained at similar to 650 nm of the solar spectrum (i.e. similar to 1.85 eV, c-Si bandgap), although the absorbing layer was affected more than a half micron depth at shorter wavelengths. Considering the observations obtained from this simulation, we have shown a simple two-step method in fabricating ultra-pure silver (Ag) nanoparticles that can be used as plasmonic nanoscatterers in a thin film solar cell. The morphology and elemental analysis of as-fabricated Ag nanoparticles was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and FESEM-coupled electron diffraction spectroscopy. The size of the as-fabricated Ag nanoparticles was found to range from 50 nm to 150 nm in diameter. Further investigations on structural and optical properties of the as-fabricated specimen were carried out using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption, photoluminesce, and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Preferential growth of ZnO along {002} was confirmed by XRD pattern that was more intense and broadened at increasing annealing temperatures. The lattice parameter c was found to increase, whereas grain size increased with increasing annealing temperature. The optical bandgap was also observed to decrease from 3.31 eV to 3.25 eV at increasing annealing temperatures through UV-Vis measurements. This parallel investigation on optical properties by simulation is in line with experimental studies and, in fact, facilitates devising optimum process cost for efficient thin film solar cell design, as well as light trapping using plasmonic nanoscatterers incorporated within the active layer.

AB Nanostructured aluminum-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) thin films of various thicknesses were deposited on flexible Poly-Ethylene Naphthalate (PEN) substrates by RF-magnetron sputtering without intentionally heating them to fabricate Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCOs). The compacted ZnO:Al nanopowder with an [Al]/[Zn] ratio of 2%, which was synthesized by the sol-gel method combined with a supercritical drying process, was used as target in the sputtering system. The structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the deposited thin films of various thicknesses have been investigated. X-ray diffraction results indicate that all of the deposited thin films have a hexagonal wurtzite structure with c-axis orientation without any secondary phases. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) cross section images revealed that the films have a dense columnar nanostructure. The atomic percentage of the compositional elements in the films was nearly the same as that in the sputtering nanopowder target. Below a critical thickness of 500 nm, the films exhibit a high transmittance (> 77% including the contribution of the PEN substrate) in the visible region. However, the electrical resistivity, Hall mobility and carrier concentration were significantly affected with the increase of film thickness. For thicknesses higher than 500 nm, the thin films exhibit similar electrical properties (resistivity of 3.5 x 10(-4) Omega cm and Hall mobility of 22 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) but the transmittance decreases in the visible region. The Photoluminescence spectra showed that the Zn interstitial atoms, which enhance the conductivity of the films, are more dominant than the other defects.

AB Porous polysilicon is fabricated through hydrothermally etching polysilicon in the solution of hydrofluoric acid containing ferric nitrate, which is characterized by the pores with similar to 40 nm and silicon nanocrystals (nc-Si) with an average size of similar to 4.1 nm. Compared with the polysilicon, the reflectance of porous polysilicon is rather low. Using the Kubelka-Munk method, the band gap with similar to 3.35 eV can be calculated. Under the excitation of 270 nm, the white photoluminescence, which chromaticity coordinate, correlative color temperature and color rendering index are (0.36, 032), similar to 4185 K and similar to 83.4, respectively, can be observed. Utilizing Gauss-Newton fitting method, white light can be decomposed into ultraviolet emission, blue emission and orange-red emission. Three peaks are attributed to the band gap emission of nc-Si, the luminescence centers formed in the silicon oxide layer and in the surface of nc-Si or in the silicon suboxidation layer encapsulating nc-Si, respectively. It is indicated that porous polysilicon might be a potential material in the white light emission field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are a range of different methods to generate a nanostructured surface on silicon (Si) but the most cost effective and optically interesting is the metal assisted wet chemical etching (MACE) (Koynov et al 2006 Appl. Phys. Lett. 88 203107). MACE of Si is a controllable, room-temperature wet-chemical technique that uses a thin layer of metal to etch the surface of Si, leaving behind various nano-and micro-scale surface features or 'black silicon'. MACE-fabricated nanowires (NWs) provide improved antireflection and light trapping functionality (Toor et al 2016 Nanoscale 8 15448-66) compared with the traditional 'iso-texturing' (Campbell and Green 1987 J. Appl. Phys. 62 243-9). The resulting lower reflection and improved light trapping can lead to higher short circuit currents in NW solar cells (Toor et al 2011 Appl. Phys. Lett. 99 103501). In addition, NW cells can have higher fill factors and voltages than traditionally processed cells, thus leading to increased solar cell efficiencies (Cabrera et al 2013 IEEE J. Photovolt. 3 102-7). MACE NW processing also has synergy with next generation Si solar cell designs, such as thin epitaxial-Si and passivated emitter rear contact (Toor et al 2016 Nanoscale 8 15448-66). While several companies have begun manufacturing black Si, and many more are researching these techniques, much of the work has not been published in traditional journals and is publicly available only through conference proceedings and patent publications, which makes learning the field challenging. There have been three specialized review articles published recently on certain aspects of MACE or black Si, but do not present a full review that would benefit the industry (Liu et al 2014 Energy Environ. Sci. 7 3223-63; Yusufoglu et al 2015 IEEE J. Photovolt. 5 320-8; Huang et al 2011 Adv. Mater. 23 285-308). In this feature article, we review the chemistry of MACE and explore how changing parameters in the wet etch process effects the resulting texture on the Si surface. Then we review efforts to increase the uniformity and reproducibility of the MACE process, which is critical for commercializing the black Si technology.

AB We report a simple one-step maskless fabrication of inverted pyramids on silicon wafers by reactive ion etching. The fabricated surface structures exhibit excellent anti-reflective properties: The total reflectance of the nano inverted pyramids fabricated by our method can be as low as 12% without any anti-reflective layers, and down to only 0.33% with a silicon nitride coating. The results from angle resolved scattering measurements indicate that the existence of triple reflections is responsible for the reduced reflectance. The surfaces with the nano inverted pyramids also exhibit a distinct milky white color.

AB Roll-to-roll hot embossing is a promising method for micro-structures fabrication with high throughput. Micro pyramid arrays with the average height of 65 pm and the bottom edge length of 175 pm were successfully fabricated on optical transparent poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-1,4-cylclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) (PETG) films via roll-to-roll hot embossing. No whitening caused by crystallization happened on PETG films during embossing. The effects of roller temperature, roller speed and applied force on the replication quality of micro-pyramid arrays were investigated. According to the effects we studied, the embossing conditions can be optimized for fabrication of high micro-pyramid arrays with low defects percentage. Optical microscope images show that micro-pyramid arrays with the average height over 60 pm have good reflection performance. The PETG films with micro-pyramid arrays can be of applications in reflective films field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amorphous silicon (a-Si) has gained its popularity in thin film Solar cell fabrication for its high absorption coefficient, high applicability on flexible substrates and practical feasibility for low-cost roll-to-roll mass fabrication. Working as the intrinsic layer, the optical-electrical characteristics of amorphous silicon film is crucial to the cell performance. In this work, the amorphous silicon film has been fabricated on PET substrate by magnetron sputtering method. The main optical-electrical characteristics have been systematically investigated under different fabrication conditions (sputtering power, working pressure, working temperature). The results indicate that the deposition rate increases remarkably from 1.88 to 834 nm/min with the sputtering power increasing from 60 W to 120 W, while the light transmission rate decreases from 86% to 46% in the visible spectrum range (390 nm to 780 nm). Theoretical calculations have been carried out, showing a decreasing deposition rate under an increasing working pressure. A rising temperature provides a higher deposition rate and lower trans-mittance in the certain range. The optimized processing parameters in the fabrication of amorphous silicon thin film are obtained for high photoelectric property on flexible substrates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SOLAR-CELLS; SILICON
AB Spalling of a brittle semiconductor substrate is an attractive method for fabricating sub-50 mu m thick single crystal semiconductor wafers in large area. Here, a spalling process to fabricate single crystal Si foils with controlled thicknesses ranging from sub-5 to 38 mu m is demonstrated using electroplated Ni stressor layers on Si substrates. In this study, the thickness profile of the Ni stressor layer was varied by changing the Ni electroplating current density, and the effect of thickness variation on the crack initiation and propagation in the underlying Si substrate was evaluated. The critical Ni thickness for crack initiation in our Ni/Si bilayer system was determined and we also show that the crack propagation depth, i.e., spalled Si thickness, is proportional to the thickness of the Ni layer at the central area of the Si wafer. Ni layer plated using 40 mA/cm(2) resulted in sub-5 mu m thick Si foil. In addition, the spalling mechanics of a Ni/Si bilayer system was analytically explored to give insight into the requirements of the Ni stressor layer for crack initiation.

AB Semiconductor liquid junctions are ubiquitous in photoelectrochemical approaches to artificial photosynthesis. By analogy with the antennae and reaction centers in natural photosynthetic complexes, separating the light-absorbing semiconductor and electrocatalysts can improve catalytic efficiency. A catalytic layer can also impair the photovoltage-generating energetics of the electrode without appropriate microscopic organization of catalytically active area on the surface. Here, we have developed a method using high-speed X-ray phase contrast imaging to study in situ electrolytic bubble growth on semiconductor electrodes fabricated with isolated, micron-scale platinum electrocatalysts. X-rays are a nonperturbative probe by which gas evolution dynamics can be studied under conditions relevant to solar fuels applications. The self-limited growth of a bubble residing on the isolated electrocatalyst was measured by tracking the evolution of the gas liquid boundary. Contrary to observations on macroscopic electrodes, bubble evolution on isolated, microscopic Pt pads on Si electrodes was insensitive to increasing overpotential. The persistence of the bubble causes mass transport limitations and inhibits the expected Tafel-like kinetics. The observed scaling of catalytic current densities with pad size implies that electrolysis is occurring predominantly on the perimeter of the active area.

AB Abundant disorderly-distributed surface functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, ether and amino groups, endow an isolated graphene oxide quantum dot (GOQD) the polar property due to the symmetry breaking, although the aggregated counterparts present no polarization owing to the random orientation. Here, flexible polarized films were fabricated using aggregated GOQDs with the assistance of external electric fields and their polarization was confirmed with the electrostatic force microscopy and polarization-electric field hysteresis loop. Such polarized GOQD films may induce charges under externally applied deformation. Here, we fabricated nanogenerators based on the films, which gave out an average current value of 0.12 mu A and an average voltage value of 12 V under a mechanical force of 60 N. This work has proposed a convenient electric-field-assisted method to give the nanomaterials new functions, which can be generalized to other materials and found applications in various fields.

AB An approach for fabricating sub-wavelength antireflective structures on SiC material is demonstrated. A time-efficient scalable nanopatterning method by rapid thermal annealing of thin metal film is applied followed by a dry etching process. Size-dependent optical properties of the antireflective SiC structures have been investigated. It is found that the surface reflection of SiC in the visible spectral range is significantly suppressed by applying the antireflective structures. Meanwhile, optical transmission and absorption could be tuned by modifying the feature size of the structure. It is believed that this effective fabrication method of antireflective structures could also be realized on other semiconductor materials or devices.

AB A simple, low-temperature hydrothermal method and atomic layer deposition (ALD) were used to fabricate ZnO nanostructures as subwavelength-structure antireflection layers (SWS ARLs) on Si solar cells. ZnO seed layers with wafer-scale uniformity were prepared, and ALD was used to reproduce two types of ZnO-based structures, nanorod arrays (NRAs) and nanotip arrays (NTAs). The study examined diammonium phosphate concentrations during growth, conducted simulations based on three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain and reflection analyses, performed X-ray diffractometer, field-emission scanning electron microscope, and high-resolution transmission electron microscope characterizations, measured total reflectance spectra by using a spectrophotometer with integrated spheres, and ran solar simulations to determine the efficiency of the Si solar cells. Coating the ZnO NTAs on the Si solar cells yielded a low total reflectance over a broad band range and produced omnidirectional light scattering on the cells, causing incident light to have a shallow penetration depth near the p-n junction and leading to an increase in short current density (Jsc). Coating the ZnO NTAs with an Al2O3 shell induced continuous variation in the refractive index, further decreasing the total reflectance to approximately 5.5%, and protected the ZnO NTAs from the harmful acidic environment. Significantly increasing the J(sc), and eta levels of the Si solar cells, the Al2O3@ZnO-NTA antireflection structure produced a high efficiency of 17.79%. Its superior performance, including low and wideband reflectance, a low process temperature, and a significant increase in efficiency, indicates the potential of this antireflective structure for enhancing solar cell efficiency in photovoltaic devices.

AB Metal nanoparticles are of great interest for light trapping in photovoltaics. They are usually incorporated in the rear electrode of solar cells, providing strong light scattering at their surface plasmon resonances. In most cases, the nanoparticles are self-assembled by solid-state dewetting over a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer incorporated in the cell's rear electrode. Up to now, this process has been optimized mainly by tuning the thermal annealing parameters responsible for dewetting, or the thickness of the precursor metallic layer; but little attention has been paid to the influence of the underlying TCO layer properties on the morphology of the nanoparticles formed, which is the focus of the present article. This work investigates Ag nanoparticles structures produced on distinct surfaces by a simple, fast and highly reproducible method employing rapid thermal annealing. The results indicate that both the thermal conductivity and surface roughness of the TCO layer play a determinant role on the morphology of the nanostructures formed. This is of particular relevance, since we show in the study performed that the parasitic absorption of these Ag nanostructures is reduced, while the scattering is enhanced when the Ag nanostructures are formed on TCO layers with the highest conductivity and the lowest surface roughness (similar to 1 nm). These results unveil novel possibilities for-the improvement of plasmonic nanostructures fabricated by thermal dewetting, via the careful adjustment of the physical properties of the underlying surface.

AB A non-vacuum processing method for preparing polymer-based ZrO2/TiO2 multilayer structure antireflection coating (ARC) films for crystalline silicon solar cells by spin coating is introduced. Initially, ZrO2, TiO2 and surface deactivated-TiO2 (SD-TiO2) based films were examined separately and the effect of photocatalytic properties of TiO2 film on the reflectivity on silicon surface was investigated. Degradation of the reflectance performance with increasing reflectivity of up to 2% in the ultraviolet region was confirmed. No significant change of the reflectance was observed when utilizing SD-TiO2 and ZrO2 films. Average reflectance (between 300 nm-1100 nm) of the silicon surface coated with optimized polymer-based ZrO2 single or ZrV/SD-TiO2 multilayer composite films was decreased down to 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Improvement of photocurrent density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency (eta) of fabricated silicon solar cells owing to the ZrO2/SD-TiO2 multilayer ARC could be confirmed. The photovoltaic properties of Jsc, the open-circuit photo voltage (V-OC), the fill factor (FF), and the eta were 31.42 mA cm(-2), 575 mV, 71.5% and 12.91%. Efficiency of the solar cells was improved by the ZrO2-polymer/SD-TiO2 polymer ARC composite layer by a factor of 0.8% with an increase of Jsc (2.07 mA cm(-2)) compared to those of fabricated without the ARC.

AB Nanostructured zinc oxide material is usable in electronic device applications such as light-emitting diodes, heterojunction diode, sensors, solar cell due to its interesting electrical conductivity and optical properties. Magnesium-doped zinc oxide nanorod (NR)-nanotube (NT) films were grown by microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition to fabricate ZnO-based heterojunction diode. It is found that ZnO hexagonal nanorods turn into hexagonal nanotubes when the Mg doping ratio is increased from 1 to 10 %. The values of the optical band gap for 1 % Mg-doped ZnO NR and 10 % Mg-doped ZnO NT films are found to be 3.14 and 3.22 eV, respectively. The n-ZnO: Mg/p-Si heterojunction diodes were fabricated. The diodes exhibited a rectification behavior with ideality factor higher than unity due to the presence of surface states in the junction and series resistance. The obtained results indicate that Mg doping improves the electrical and optical properties of ZnO.

AB We report a high-throughput, single-step method for fabricating rippled plasmonic nanostructure arrays via self-assembly induced by oblique angle cluster ion beam irradiation of metal surfaces. This approach does not require lithographic or chemical processes and has the prominent advantage of possible large surface area coverage and applicability to different starting materials. The polarization dependent plasmonic property of the gold nano-ripple is due to their one dimension structure. The localized plasmon resonance frequency of synthesized nano-ripple arrays is tunable by changing nano-ripple dimensions that can be engineered by changing the cluster ion beam irradiation parameters. In this specific case presented, using 30 keV Ar-gas cluster ion beam, we fabricate gold nano-ripple arrays that show localized plasmon resonance in the visible range through near IR range, tunable by varying cluster ion irradiation fluence.

AB Si nanopyramids have been suggested as one of the most promising Si nanostructures to realize high-efficient ultrathin solar cells or photodetectors due to their low surface area enhancement and outstanding ability to enhance light absorption. However, the present techniques to fabricate Si nanopyramids are either complex or expensive. In parallel, disordered nanostructures are believed to be extremely effective to realize broadband light trapping for solar cells. Here, a simple and cost-effective method is presented to form random Si nanopyramids based on an all-solution process, the mechanism behind which is the successful transfer of the generation site of bubbles from Si surface to the introduced Ag nanoparticles so that OH- can react with the entire Si surface to naturally form random and dense Si nucleus. For optical performance, it is experimentally demonstrated that the random Si nanopyramid textured ultrathin crystalline Si (c-Si) can achieve light trapping approaching the Lambertian limit. Importantly, it is revealed, by numerical calculations, that random Si nanopyramids outperform periodic ones on broadband light absorption due to more excited optical resonance modes. The finding provides a new opportunity to improve the performance of ultrathin c-Si solar cells with a simpler process and lower cost.

AB Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates are emerging as a platform for simple, cost-effective, high-throughput top-down nanofabrication of regular arrays of nanostructures. Thus far, however, AAO pattern transfer has largely been restricted to smooth and chemically inert surfaces, mostly Silicon substrates. Here, we present a more generalizable strategy for preparing free-standing through-hole ultrathin alumina membranes (UTAMs) and transferring them to both smooth and rough substrates, thereby enabling the fabrication of centimeter-scale arrays of nanostructures with sub-100 nm feature diameters on almost arbitrary substrates. To validate the utility of our procedures, we transferred UTAMs to surfaces relevant for photocatalytic applications and prepared plasmonic photocathodes consisting of dense arrays of size-controlled sub-100 nm Au and Ni nanodots on top of chemically noninert NiOx thin films. To demonstrate the functionality of the fabricated structures, we used a plasmonic photocathode consisting of an array of sub-50 nm Au nanodots on NiOx/Al substrates to drive direct, plasmon-enhanced photoelectrocatalysis and found excellent device performance. We also successfully decorated very rough fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates with an array of high-density sub-100 nm nanodots. Our results extend the opportunities for AAO masks to serve as generic templates for novel applications that were previously prohibited by lack of methods to transfer to the required substrate.

AB We use metal-assisted chemical etching (MCE) method to fabricate nanostructured black silicon on the surface of C-Si. The Si-PIN photoelectronic detector based on this type of black silicon shows excellent device performance with a responsivity of 0.57 A/W at 1060 nm. Silicon nanocone arrays can be created using MCE treatment. These modified surfaces show higher light absorptance in the near-infrared range (800 to 2500 nm) compared to that of C-Si with polished surfaces, and the variations in the absorption spectra of the nanostructured black silicon with different etching processes are obtained. The maximum light absorptance increases significantly up to 95 % in the wavelength range of 400 to 2500 nm.

AB We investigated the chemical mist deposition (CMD) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on textured crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrate for efficient c-Si/PEDOT:PSS heterojunction solar cells. The Mie scattering observation and differential mobility analysis characterization revealed that the average size of mist particle decreased from 330 to 30 '10 nm with increasing the number density and traveling velocity of mist precursor when positive dc bias of 10 kV was applied to the c-Si substrate. The uniform deposition of PEDOT:PSS films was performed on textured c-Si with the increased adhesion by suitably adjusting V-s and substrate temperature. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.57% was obtained with J of 36.1 mA cm(-2), Vo, of 0.49 V, and 1-1- of 0.66, when a positive V-s of 10 kV was applied to c-Si substrate. Furthermore, PCE increased to 12.5% with J of 35.6 mA cm(-2), V-oc of 0.53 V, and FF of 0.67 by adding a 20-nm-thick AR coating layer of molybdenum oxide MoOx, (refractive index, n = 2.1) fabricated by CMD using 12 molybdo(VI) phosphoric acid n-hydrate [H-3(PMo12O40) nH(2)O] as a precursor. These findings imply that CMD using negatively charged mist precursor is a possible method for the uniform deposition of PEDOT:PSS on textured c-Si substrate for efficient c-Si/PEDOT:PSS heterojunction solar cells.

AB Core-shell heterostructured nanomaterials with mesopores have enormous potential applications in diverse fields. Herein, we report a facile extended Stober method to synthesize core-shell heterostructured semiconducting nanomaterials with mesoporosity. Silver (Ag) metal-assisted chemically wet etched p-type silicon nanowires (Si NWs) were used as the core, and layer-controllable mesoporous n-type anatase TiO2 was grown as the shell to successfully fabricate the core-shell p-Si@mesoporous n-TiO2 hybrid materials. Detailed characterization reveals that the TiO2 shell was composed of aggregated crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles with diameters of approximate to 15 nm, where the TiO2 coating thickness was tuned approximate to 50 nm. The interstitial pores of these nanoparticles were observed with average pore sizes of 4-8 nm. The core-shell structured p-Si@mesoporous n-TiO2 hybrid materials were demonstrated as photocathodes for the solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) production of H-2 at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.

AB A wet-chemical surface texturing technique, including a two-step metal-catalyzed chemical etching (MCCE) and an extra alkaline treatment, has been proven as an efficient way to fabricate high-efficiency black multicrystalline (mc) silicon solar cells, whereas it is limited by the production capacity and the cost cutting due to the complicated process. Here, we demonstrated that with careful control of the composition in etching solution, low-aspect-ratio bowl-like nanostructures with atomically smooth surfaces could be directly achieved by improved one-step MCCE and with no posttreatment, like alkali solution. The doublet surface texture of implementing this nanobowl structure upon the industrialized acidic-textured surface showed concurrent improvement in optical and electrical properties for realizing 18.23% efficiency mc-Si solar cells (156 mm x 156 mm), which is sufficiently higher than 17.7% of the solely acidic-textured cells in the same batch. The one-step MCCE method demonstrated in this study may provide a cost-effective way to manufacture high-performance mc-Si solar cells for the present photovoltaic industry.

AB A novel emitter patterning method for back-contacted Si heterojunction solar cells is presented, which combines laser processing and wet etching of a mask layer stack with self-aligned repassivation, thus reducing the process complexity, as compared with the commonly used emitter patterning methods. Lifetime samples demonstrate that with a suitable mask stack, laser scribing can be performed without inducing laser damage to the passivation. Despite nonoptimal wet etch and repassivation processes which currently limit the obtained lifetime, proof-of-concept cells on p-type wafers fabricated using this novel emitter patterning process and lithographically patterned metallization exhibit an open-circuit voltage of 694 mV and pseudo-fill-factors of 83%. With the laser written mask layers for etching and self-aligned passivation process, we have thus developed the proof-of-concept for a simple, lithography free, and contactless emitter patterning method for industrial applications

AB Here we have presented the results of large area (30 x 30 cm(2)) silicon-hydrogen alloy material and solar cell by argon dilution method. As an alternative to hydrogen dilution, argon dilution method has been applied to develop single junction solar cell with appreciable stability. Optimization of deposition conditions revealed that 95% argon dilution gives a nanostructured material with improved transport property and less light induced degradation. The minority carrier diffusion length (L-d) and mobility-lifetime (mu tau) product of the material with 95% argon dilution degrades least after light soaking. Also the density of states (DOS) below conduction level reveals that this material is less defective. Solar cell with this argon diluted material has been fabricated with all the layers deposited by argon dilution method. Finally we have compared the argon diluted solar cell results with the optimized hydrogen diluted solar cell. Light soaking study proves that it is possible to develop stable solar cell on large area by argon dilution method and that the degradation of argon diluted solar cell is less than that of hydrogen diluted one.

AB In this work, results on laser processing of thin zinc oxide films deposited on metal substrate are presented. ZnO films are obtained by classical nanosecond pulsed laser deposition method in oxygen atmosphere on tantalum substrate. The produced films are then processed by nanosecond laser pulses at wavelength of 355 nm. The laser processing parameters and the film thickness are varied and their influence on the fabricated structures is estimated. The film morphology after the laser treatment is found to depend strongly on the laser fluence as two regimes are defined. It is shown that at certain conditions (high fluence regime) the laser treatment of the film leads to formation of a discrete nanostructure, composed of spherical like nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. The dynamics of the melt film on the substrate and fast cooling are found to be the main mechanisms for fabrication of the observed structures. The demonstrated method is an alternative way for direct fabrication of ZnO nanostructures on metal which can be easy implemented in applications as resistive sensor devices, electroluminescent elements, solar cell technology.

AB Silicon (Si) nanostructure-based photovoltaic devices are attractive for their excellent optical and electrical performance, but show lower efficiency than their planar counterparts due to the increased surface recombination associated with the high surface area and roughness. Here, we demonstrate an efficiency enhancement for hybrid nanostructured Si/polymer solar cells based on a novel Si honeycomb (SiHC) structure using a simple etching method. SiHC structures are fabricated using a combination of nanosphere lithography and plasma treatment followed by a wet chemical post-etching. SiHC has shown superior light-trapping ability in comparison with the other Si nanostructures, along with a robust structure. Anisotropic tetramethylammonium hydroxide etching not only tunes the final surface morphologies of the nanostructures, but also reduces the surface roughness leading to a lower recombination rate in the hybrid solar cells. The suppressed recombination loss, benefiting from the reduced surface-to-volume ratio and roughness, has resulted in a high open-circuit voltage of 600 mV, a short-circuit current of 31.46 mA cm(-2) due to the light-trapping ability of the SiHCs, and yields a power conversion efficiency of 12.79% without any other device structure optimization.

AB Structural colors of the ordered photonic nanostructures are widely used as an effective platform for manipulating the propagation of light. Although several approaches have been explored in attempts to mimic the structural colors, improving the reproducibility, mechanical stability, and the economic feasibility of sophisticated photonic crystals prepared by complicated processes continues to pose a challenge. In this study, we report on an alternative, simple method for fabricating a tunable photonic crystal at room temperature. A bowl-like nanostructure of TiO2 was periodically arranged on a thin Ti sheet through a two-step anodization process where its diameters were systemically controlled by changing the applied voltage. Consequently, they displayed a broad color distribution, ranging from red to indigo, and the principal reason for color generation followed the Bragg diffraction theory. This noncolorant method was capable of reproducing a Mondrian painting on a centimeter scale without the need to employ complex architectures, where the generated structural colors were highly stable under mechanical or chemical influence. Such a color printing technique represents a potentially promising platform for practical applications for anticounterfeit trademarks, wearable sensors, and displays.

AB This work studies the dependency of the effective lifetime on the a-Si: H layer thickness of c-Si substrates passivated with intrinsic a-Si: H. This is experimentally investigated by using a soft wet-etching method that enables accurate control of the a-Si: H layer thickness. In this way, variations in the effective lifetime down to thicknesses of a few nanometers are studied, while excluding effects originating from the deposition conditions of a-Si: H when samples of different thicknesses are fabricated. For thin passivation layers, results show a strong thickness dependency of the effective lifetime, which is mainly influenced by the recombination at the external a-Si: H surfaces. For thicker passivation layers, the effective lifetime is predominantly determined by the bulk a-Si: H and/or c-Si defect density. During the etching of the a-Si: H passivation layers, a gradient in the Cody gap for our samples is observed. This gradient is accompanied by a stronger decrease in the effective lifetime and is attributed to a decrease in the a-Si: H band gap and valence band offset. The observed changes in lifetime with a-Si: H layer thickness are supported with AFORS-HET simulations. When a gradient in the a-Si: H passivation layer band gap is used, simulations can reproduce the experimental results. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Nanocrystalline silicon suboxides (nc-SiOx) have attracted attention during the past years for the use in thin-film silicon solar cells. We investigated the relationships between the nanostructure as well as the chemical, electrical, and optical properties of phosphorous, doped, nc-SiO0.8: H fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The nanostructure was varied through the sample series by changing the deposition pressure from 533 to 1067 Pa. The samples were then characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy, aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, and a specialized plasmon imaging method. We found that the material changed with increasing pressure from predominantly amorphous silicon monoxide to silicon dioxide containing nanocrystalline silicon. The nanostructure changed from amorphous silicon filaments to nanocrystalline silicon filaments, which were found to cause anisotropic electron transport. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Almost vertically aligned ZnO nanowires have been grown on Silicon substrates via a simple hydrothermal method. In order to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency for fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), an easily-operated immersing method was employed to fabricate a TiO2/ZnO nanowires array heterojunction, which has advantage of high aspect ratio, low recombination rate and high absorption of visible light. The structure and surface morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The photovoltaic properties of TiO2/ZnO based DSCCs were measured by considering the power efficiency (eta), photocurrent density (J (sc)), open-circuit voltage (V (oc)), and fill factor (FF). An efficiency of 0.559% is achieved for the composite cell, increasing 0.426 and 0.185% for the ZnO nanowires cell and TiO2 cell, respectively. The short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage are also enhancing. The improvements are because of high surface are of TiO2 shell layer, as well as fast electron transport and light scattering effect of ZnO nanowires.

AB A hybrid method consisting of ultrafast laserassisted texturing and chemical fluorination treatment was applied for efficiently enhancing the surface broadband antireflection to fabricate black titanium alloy surface with ultra-light-trapping micro-nanostructure. Based on the theoretical analysis of surface antireflective principle of micronanostructures and fluoride film, the ultra-light-trapping micro-nanostructures have been processed using a picosecond pulsed ultrafast laser on titanium alloy surfaces. Then fluorination treatment has been performed by using fluoroalkyl silane solution. According to X-ray diffraction phase analysis of the surface compositions and measurement of the surface reflectance using spectrophotometer, the broadband antireflective properties of titanium alloy surface with micro-nano structural characteristics were investigated before and after fluorination treatment. The results show that the surface morphology of micro-nanostructures processed by picosecond laser has significant effects on the antireflection of light waves to reduce the surface reflectance, which can be further reduced using chemical fluorination treatment. The high antireflection of over 98 % in a broad spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared on the surface of metal material has been achieved for the surface structures, and the broadband antireflective black metal surfaces with an extremely low reflectance of ultra-light-trapping structures have been obtained in the wavelength range from ultraviolet-visible to near-infrared, middlewave infrared. The average reflectance of microgroove groups structured surface reaches as low as 2.43 % over a broad wavelength range from 200 to 2600 nm. It indicates that the hybrid method comprising of picosecond laser texturing and chemical fluorination can effectively induce the broadband antireflective black metal surface. This method has a potential application for fabricating antireflective surface used to improve the photothermal or photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar installations and enhancing the surface wave-absorbing capacity of devices.

AB We present two straightforward and cost-effective methods, based on metal-assisted chemical etching and a direct imprinting technique, to fabricate metal-covered porous amorphous silicon back reflectors for amorphous silicon solar cells. We demonstrate an increase of approximately 30% in both short-circuit current and overall efficiency with respect to a cell with a flat metal back reflector. This is achieved by implementing light trapping via either a roughened porous amorphous silicon layer or an imprinted periodic grating. This work provides a pathway to increase amorphous silicon solar cell efficiency via increased absorption without significantly impacting processing costs.

AB Ce3+ and Yb3+ co-doped YBO3 phosphors were facilely fabricated by a hydrothermal method. The investigations reveal that hexagonal YBO3: Ce3, Yb3+ nanoparticles aggregate to form cyclic structure after annealing at 900 degrees C. An efficient near-infrared (NIR) quantum cutting phenomenon involving the emission of two NIR photons (971 nm) for each ultraviolet (UV) photon (360 nm) absorbed is observed based on the cooperative energy transfer (CET) from Ce3+ to Yb3+ in YBO3 with a CET efficiency of 41.9%. Moreover, YBO3: Ce3+, Yb3+/SiO2 films with anti-reflection and NIR quantum cutting abilities were prepared by dip-coating method. The as prepared composite films can convert UV photons into NIR photons between 950 nm and 1050 nm, which well matched with the spectral response of the silicon based solar cell. The experimental results indicate that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of silicon solar cell can be effectively improved by assembling the YBO3: Ce3+, Yb3+/SiO2 bi-functional film, and the corresponding conversion efficiency is about 0.521% higher than the pure glass and 0.252% higher than the pure SiO2 anti-reflection (AR) film. In a word, this work provides a simple strategy to develop optical films with AR and NIR quantum cutting abilities for solar energy conversion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

AB The photovoltaic effect of the silicon (Si)/silicon carbide (SiC) quantum dot super lattice (QDSL) and multi-quantum well (QW) strucutres is presented based on numerical simulation and experimental studies. The QDSL and QW structures act as an intermediate layer in a p-i-n Si solar cell. The QDSL consists of a stack of four 4-nm Si nano disks and 2-nm SiC barrier layers embedded in a SiC matrix fabricated with a top-down etching process. The Si nano disks were observed with bright field-scanning transmission electron microscopy. The simulation results based on the 3D finite element method confirmed that the quantum effect on the band structure for the QDSL and QW structures was different and had different effects on solar cell operation. The effect of vertical wave-function coupling to form a miniband in the QDSL was observed based on the solar-cell performance, showing a dramatic photovoltaic response in generating a high photocurrent density J(sc) of 29.24mA/cm(2), open circuit voltage V-oc of 0.51V, fill factor FF of 0.74, and efficiency eta of 11.07% with respect to a i-QW solar cell with J(sc) of 25.27mA/cm(2), V-oc of 0.49V, FF of 0.69, and eta of 8.61% and an i-Si solar cell with J(sc) of 27.63mA/cm(2), V-oc of 0.55V, FF of 0.61, and eta of 10.00%. A wide range of photo-carrier transports by the QD arrays in the QDSL solar cell is possible in the internal quantum efficiency spectra with respect to the internal quantum efficiency of the i-QW solar cell.

AB Broadband optical antireflective arrays of sub-wavelength structures were fabricated on silicon substrates using colloidal nanosphere lithography in conjunction with reactive ion etching. The morphology of the nanostructures, including the shape, base diameter and height, was precisely controlled by modifying the conventional process of nanosphere lithography. We investigated their effects on the optical characteristics based on experimentally measured reflectance performance. The Si nanostructure arrays demonstrated optical antireflection performance with an average reflectance of about 1% across the spectral range from 300 to 800 nm, i.e. near-ultraviolet to visible wavelengths. This fabrication method can be used to create a large surface area and offers a promising approach for antireflective applications.

AB Silicon photoanodes protected by atomic layer deposited (ALD) TiO2 show promise as components of water splitting devices that may enable the large-scale production of solar fuels and chemicals. Minimizing the resistance of the oxide corrosion protection layer is essential for fabricating efficient devices with good fill factor. Recent literature reports have shown that the interfacial SiO2 layer, interposed between the protective ALD-TiO2 and the Si anode, acts as a tunnel oxide that limits hole conduction from the photoabsorbing substrate to the surface oxygen evolution catalyst. Herein, we report a significant reduction of bilayer resistance, achieved by forming stable, ultrathin (<1.3 nm) SiO2 layers, allowing fabrication of water splitting photoanodes with hole conductances near the maximum achievable with the given catalyst and Si substrate. Three methods for controlling the SiO2 interlayer thickness on the Si(100) surface for ALD-TiO2 protected anodes were employed: (1) TiO2 deposition directly on an HF-etched Si(100) surface, (2) TiO2 deposition after SiO2 atomic layer deposition on an HF-etched Si(100) surface, and (3) oxygen scavenging, post-TiO2 deposition to decompose the SiO2 layer using a Ti overlayer. Each of these methods provides a progressively superior means of reliably thinning the interfacial SiO2 layer, enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable water oxidation silicon anodes.

AB Nanoimprinting lithography (NIL) is investigated as a promising method to define nanostructure; however, finding a practical method to achieve large area patterning of conjugated polymer remains a challenge. We demonstrate here that a simple and cost-effective technique is proposed to fabricate the nanoimprinted P3HT nanograting by solvent-assisted room temperature NIL (SART-NIL) method with patterned ETFE film as mold. The patterned ETFE template is produced by embossing ETFE film into a patterned silicon master and is used as template to transfer nanogratings during the SART-NIL process. It indicates that highly reproducible and well-controlled P3HT nanograting film is obtained successfully with feature size of nanogratings ranging from 130 to 700 nm, due to the flexibility, stiffness, and low surface energy of ETFE mold. Moreover, the SART-NIL method using ETFE mold is able to fabricate nanogratings but not to induce the change of molecular orientation within conjugated polymer. The conducting ability of P3HT nanograting in the vertical direction is also not damaged after patterning. Finally, we further apply P3HT nanograting for the fabrication of active layer of OBHJ solar cell device, to investigate the morphology role presented by ETFE mold in device performance. The device performance of OBHJ solar cell is preferential to that of PBHJ device obviously.

AB Indium tin oxide (ITO)/ indium oxide (InxO) double layer structure was adopted as the transparent conduction and light scattering function layer to improve the light extraction efficiency of the GaN-based blue LEDs. The double layer structure was first deposited in one run by electron beam evaporation using ITO and Indium as the source respectively, and then annealed in an oxygen environment. This method can fabricate transparent electrode with microstructure and low specific contact resistivity one time free from lithography and etching, which makes the fabrication process simple and at a lower cost. For the 220 nm ITO/ 170 nm InxO double layer sample annealed at 600 degrees C for 15 min in oxygen, measurement results show that its root mean square of roughness of the surface microstructure can be as high as 85.2 nm which introduces the strongest light scattering. Its light transmittance at 450 nm can maintain 92.4%. At the same time, it can realize lower specific contact resistivity with p-InGaN. Compared with the GaN-based blue LEDs with only 220 nm ITO electrode, the light output power of the LEDs with 220 nm ITO/ 170 nm InxO double layer structure can be increased about 58.8%, and working voltage at 20 mA injection current is decreased about 0.23 V due to the enhanced current spreading capability. The light output power improvement is also theoretically convinced by finite difference time domain simulations. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America.

AB Interest in the heteroepitaxy of GaAs on Si has never failed in the last years due to the potential for monolithic integration of GaAs-based devices with Si integrated circuits. But in spite of this effort, devices fabricated from them still use homo-epitaxy only. Here we present an epitaxial technique based on the epitaxial lateral overgrowth of micrometer scale GaAs crystals on a thin SiO2 layer from nanoscale Si seeds. This method permits the integration of high quality and defect-free crystalline GaAs on Si substrate and provides active GaAs/Si heterojunctions with efficient carrier transport through the thin SiO2 layer. The nucleation from small width openings avoids the emission of misfit dislocations and the formation of antiphase domains. With this method, we have experimentally demonstrated for the first time a monolithically integrated GaAs/Si diode with high current densities of 10 kA. cm(-2) for a forward bias of 3.7 V. This epitaxial technique paves the way to hybrid III-V/Si devices that are free from lattice-matching restrictions, and where silicon not only behaves as a substrate but also as an active medium.

AB We developed a technique for forming textured aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO: Al) transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films on glass substrates, which were etched using a mixture of hydrofluoric (HF) and hydrochloric (HCl) acids. The etching depth and surface roughness increased with an increase in the HF content and the etching time. The HF-based residues produced insoluble hexafluorosilicate anion-and oxide impurity-based semipermeable films, which reduced the etching rate. Using a small amount of HCl dissolved the Ca compounds, helping to fragment the semipermeable film. This formed random, complex structures on the glass substrates. The angled deposition of three layers of ZnO: Al led to the synthesis of multiscaled ZnO: Al textures on the glass substrates. The proposed approach resulted in textured ZnO: Al TCO films that exhibited high transmittance (similar to 80%) and high haze (>40%) values over wavelengths of 400-1000 nm, as well as low sheet resistances (<18 Omega/sq). Si tandem solar cells based on the ZnO: Al textured TCO films exhibited photocurrents and cell efficiencies that were 40% higher than those of cells with conventional TCO films.

AB The gravure offset method has been developed toward an industrially viable printing technique for electronic circuitry. In this paper, a roller type gravure offset manufacturing process was developed to fabricate fine line for using front electrode for solar cells. In order to obtain the optimum metallization printing lines, thickness of 20 mu m which is narrow line is required. The main targets are the reduction of metallized area to reduce the shading loss, and a high conductivity to transport the current as loss free as possible out of the cell. However, it is well known that there is a poor contact resistance between the front Ag electrode and the n(+) emitter. Nickel plating was conducted to prevent the increase of contact resistance and the increase of fill factor (FF). The performance of n-Si/Ag (seed layer)/Ni solar cells were observed in 609 mV of open circuit voltage, 35.54 mA/cm(2) of short circuit current density, 75.75% of fill factor, and 16.04% of conversion efficiency.

AB We demonstrate the light trapping effect in amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer by inserting a layer of periodic molybdenum disc array (MDA) between the a-Si:H layer and the quartz substrate, which forms a three-layer structure of Si/MDA/SiO2. The MDA layer was fabricated by a new cost-effective method based on nano-imprint technology. Further light absorption enhancement was realized through altering the topography of MDA by annealing it at 700 degrees C. The mechanism of light absorption enhancement in a-Si:H interfaced with MDA was analyzed, and the electric field distribution and light absorption curve of the different layers in the Si/MDA structure under light illumination of different wavelengths were simulated by employing numerical finite difference time domain (FDTD) solutions.

AB In this work, we present a plasmonic near infrared light photodetector for the detection of 980 nm illumination. The plasmonic photodetector is fabricated by modifying single layer graphene (SLG)/InP Schottky junction diode with SiO2 encapsulated gold nanorods (SiO2@AuNR), which can confine the incident NIR light by inducing obvious localized surface plasmon resonance, according to theoretical simulation based on finite element method. This study shows that after decoration with plasmonic SiO2@AuNR, the device performance in terms of photocurrent and responsivity is considerably enhanced. In addition, the device exhibited a very fast respose rate which is able to monitor switching optical signals with a frequency as high as 1 MHz, suggesting a potential application for sensing high-frequency optical signals. This study manifests that the present plasmonic NIR photodetector will have great potential in future optoelectronic devices application.

AB In this paper, we present a simple method to fabricate the antireflective porous surface on sodalime glass using a single step HF-vapor phase etching method. Under optimal conditions, both-sides etched glass substrate exhibited a broadband enhancement in the transmittance with maximum transmittance as high as 99.2% at similar to 500 nm with extremely low diffusive scattering. The measured transmittance exceeds by similar to 7.6% as compared to plain glass (91.6%). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the formation of a fluoride layer comprising of NaF and CaF2 on sodalime glass substrate after etching. Field emission scanning electron microscopy results showed the formation of porous structure with randomly distributed pores of size <150 nm. The refractive index of the porous fluoride layer was found to be 1.28 and lowest reflectance of 0.6% has been achieved. Moreover, reflection (measured at 500 nm) remains below 1.5% over a range of incident angles (8-48 degrees), which is ascribed to the fact that refractive index follows a gradual change in the nanoporous surface. The theoretical transmittance of the optimized etched glass determined by finite difference time domain simulation shows a good agreement with the experimental results. The silicon solar cell covered with both-sides optimized etched glass showed a relative increase of similar to 4% in power conversion efficiency as compared to a solar cell covered with a plain glass.

AB Recent numerical modeling of plasmonic metallic nanostructures have shown great potential as a method of light management in thin-film nanodisc-patterned hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar photovoltaic (PV) cells. A significant design challenge for such plasmonic-enhanced PV devices is the requirement for ultra-thin transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) with high transmittance (low loss) and low enough resistivity to be used as device top contacts/electrodes. Most work on TCOs is on relatively thick layers and the few reported cases of thin TCO showed a marked decrease in conductivity. Recent work on ultra-thin TCOs of aluminum-doped zinc oxide, indium-doped tin oxide and zinc oxide revealed an unavoidable trade-off between transmittance and resistivity when fabricated with conventional growth methods. Ultra-thin films showed a tendency to be either amorphous and continuous or form as isolated islands. This results in poor electrical properties, which cannot be improved with annealing as the delicate thin films nucleate to form grain clusters. In order to overcome this challenge, this study investigates a novel method of producing ultra-thin (< 40 nm) high quality TCOs. First, 80 nm ITO films are sputtered in various argon-oxygen atmospheres and annealed to increase conductivity. The most promising materials were then reduced in thickness with a controlled low-cost room-temperature cyclic wet chemical etching process to reach the desired thickness. The degradation in the electrical conductivity was tracked as a function of thickness. The sheet resistance of 36 nm thin films was observed to be of the same order compared to the much thicker commercial ITO films currently used as transparent electrodes in PV and other opto-electronic devices. Experimental optical properties of the shaved films were then used in an optimized model of nano-disc plasmonic a-Si:H solar cells. Simulations indicate that optical enhancement greater than 21% are possible in the 300-730 nm wavelength range, when compared to the reference cell. Using the novel chemical shaving method described here, high-quality ultra-thin ITO films capable of improving the efficiency of thin film a-Si:H solar cells have been demonstrated. The methods employed in the optimization process are well established and economically viable, which provide the technical potential for commercialization of plasmonic based solar cells.

AB A simple and low cost MACE method was demonstrated for efficiently texturing commercial mc-Si wafer at room temperature. The effects of fabrication parameters (deposition time, HF concentration, H2O2 concentration, and etching time) on the morphology structure, antireflection property of textured mc-Si were carefully studied. The large scale SiNWs arrays with different structure can be obtained under various fabrication conditions. Meanwhile, the results indicate that the fabricate parameters have important effect on the reflectance of textured mc-Si sample in the order of etching time > deposition time > H2O2 concentration > HF concentration. The comprehensive research results indicate that it is more beneficial for the nanowire arrays with tapering structure and the length of 13 mu m to obtain excellent antireflection property. Under these optimization conditions, the textured mc-Si shows an outstanding anti-reflectance ability of similar to 5.6%, which indicates that the Ag-catalysis etched mc-Si shows a huge potential application in high-efficiency polysilicon solar cells.
