AB Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries may fail through thermal runaway caused by increased temperature. It is thus important to monitor battery temperature for prevention of the battery failure. Currently, thermal monitoring of the battery for electric vehicles (EVs) is being conducted by multiple thermostats. As the size of battery system increases and the cells are closely packed to exploit high power density, the number of thermostats is also increased to monitor the battery system. However, this increased number of sensors enhances the probability of the sensor malfunction, which prevents robust thermal monitoring, and causes increased maintenance cost and customer complaints. This paper thus proposes an online applicable temperature prediction model for EV battery pack while minimizing the number of sensors and keeping the monitoring capability. This was possible with three ideas: (a) devising battery thermal characterization test under various operating conditions, (b) development of the online-applicable temperature prediction model using artificial neural network (ANN), and (c) validation of the temperature prediction model. The proposed temperature prediction model was demonstrated with the EV battery pack that consists of twelve battery modules.

AB The Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as energy sources in different hybrid systems, however, the operation characteristics of the battery in such systems are strongly dependent on the operation temperature and therefore, with purpose to improve these characteristics a good thermal control system should be utilized. This paper describes the modelling thermal management system for the battery pack in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), which gives opportunity to control the operation temperature of the pack for different load cycles and ambient temperatures. The thermal model of the battery pack is created by using an equivalent electrical circuit with lumped parameters. The thermal control system is created as a combination of the cooling system of the internal combustion engine and the battery pack thermal control system. The heat transfer between these systems is performed by a plate heat exchanger where the inlet flow is controlled by a three-way valve with an electric actuator. Artificial intelligent algorithms together with estimator are applied in control system, with purpose to obtain suitable control properties.

AB In electric vehicle applications, batteries are usually packed in modules to satisfy the energy and power demand. To facilitate the thermal management of a battery pack, a model-based observer could be designed to estimate the temperature distribution across the pack. Nevertheless, cost target in industry practice drives the number of temperature sensors in a pack to a number that is not sufficient to yield observability of all the temperature states. This paper focuses on formulating the observer design and sensor deployment strategy that could achieve the optimal observer performance under the frugal sensor allocation. The considered observer performance is the estimation errors induced by model and sensor uncertainty. The observer aims at minimizing the worst-case estimation errors under bounded model and sensor uncertainty.

AB Lithium-ion batteries for automotive applications are subject to aging with usage and environmental conditions, leading to the reduction of the performance, reliability and life span of the battery pack. To this extent, the ability of simulating the dynamic behavior of a battery pack using high-fidelity electrochemical and thermal models could provide very useful information for the design of Battery Management Systems (BMS). For instance such models could be used to predict the impact of cell-to-cell variations in the electrical and thermal properties on the overall performance of the pack, as well as on the propagation of degradation from one cell to another.
   This paper presents a method for fast simulation of an integrated electrochemical-thermal battery pack model based on first-principles. First, a coupled electrochemical and thermal model is developed for a single cell, based upon the data of a composite LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 - LiMn2O4 (LMO-NMC) Li-ion battery, and validated on experimental data. Then, the cell model is extended to a reconfigurable and parametric model of a complete battery pack. The proposed modeling approach is completely general and applicable to characterize any pack topology, varying electrical connections and thermal boundary conditions. Finally, simulation results are shown to illustrate the effects of parameter variability on the pack performance.

AB This paper presents a dynamic model for simulating the heat generation and the impact of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) on the maximum temperature in LiFePO4 battery cells. The model is constructed by coupling a one-dimensional electrochemical model with a two-dimensional thermal model and fluid flow model in a battery pack array. Two different realizations are analysed and compared, one when the heat equation is considered for the PCM (no-flow case) and another one when fluid flow is considered. The results show that by using PCMs, the maximum temperature drops considerably for both cases. The temperature differences between the two cases is found to be insignificant, with the observation that by adding fluid flow, the phases mixture is smoother. Moreover, by using fluid flow, the calculation time increases excessively due to the high non-linearity.

AB A novel liquid-cooled (50-50 ethylene glycol-water mixture) composite cold plate made of phase-change material (PCM) is proposed as a thermal management solution for energy storage systems (ESS) in hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV). The composite cold plate is lighter than a traditional aluminum cold plate and able to absorb high heat flux spikes. Furthermore, the pump operation time is reduced. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a preliminary PCM cold plate subjected to constant heat flux. The inlet temperature of the working fluid is parametrically varied and results include PCM temperatures and pump operation times.

AB This paper presents the thermal management analysis performed on lithium polymer cells designed for High Performance Electric Vehicle (HPEV) "applications. The objective was to choose an optimum temperature range for the cells to operate at, determine the thermal response of the cells under their full spectrum of discharge capabilities, calculate the necessary convective heat transfer necessary to maintain the cells within said temperature range, then to create a thermal management solution to incorporate into a battery pack composed of 288 cells. Thermal testing and modeling on individual lithium polymer cells determined the thermal response and amount of convection cooling required for the cells over their intended duty cycles. A convective heat transfer coefficient of 50 W/m(2)K was determined to be sufficient to prevent the proposed cell from exceeding the optimum temperature range during its most strenuous duty cycle. The proposed design scheme utilized a fan to force air circulation up along the side of modules where each module consists of four cells connected in series. A proposed feedback control loop system allowed for active control of the battery cell's temperature resulting in an increase in efficiency and overall performance for HPEV applications.

AB Thermal analysis and management of batteries have been an important research issue for battery-operated systems such as electric vehicles and mobile devices. Nowadays, battery packs are designed considering heat dissipation, and external cooling devices such as a cooling fan are also widely used to enforce the reliability and extend the lifetime of a battery. This type of approaches that target the enhancement of the cooling efficiency via the reduction of the thermal resistance cannot achieve an immediate temperature drop to avoid a thermal emergency situation. Approaches based on removing the heat from the heat sources via idle period insertion (similar to what is done for silicon devices) would allow faster thermal response; however it is not obvious how to implement these schemes in the context of batteries.
   In this paper, we propose the use of a simple parallel batterysupercapacitor hybrid architecture with a dual-mode discharging strategy that can provide immediate temperature management, in which the supercapacitor is used as an energy buffer during the idle periods of the battery. Simulation results shows that the proposed method can keep the battery temperature within the safe range without external cooling devices while exploiting the advantage of the battery-supercapacitor parallel connection.

AB Battery Pack life time depending on thermal management is a crucial issue in Electric and Electric Hybrid vehicles. Excessive thermal losses caused by the battery current ripples can be well avoided by introducing suitable topology. This paper proposes utilization of interleaved DC-DC converters to reduce the battery pack current ripples. Interleaved converters have some advantages such as low current ripple, low losses and high reliability. This paper considers Ni-MH batteries used in Toyota Prius 2010 and takes the high frequency model of Ni-MH battery into account to show the effect of ripple current on battery. While design equations and considerations are explored, conventional converter and interleaved DC-DC converter are modeled and simulated to study and compare the battery current ripples in boost and buck modes of operation. It is shown that current ripples of interleaved converter are much lower resulting in extension of battery pack life time.

AB In hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) battery, thermal management is critical to maintain the battery safety and a longer useful life. A novel thermal management structure (TMS) for a HEV lithium ion (Li-ion) battery pack is designed in this research. First, two air cooling structures: series thermal management structure (STMS) and parallel thermal management structure (PTMS) are proposed and optimized by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow field analysis. CFD temperature field analysis shows that STMS's performance is interior to the PTMS, with a larger internal temperature rise and a more significant internal temperature difference. Based on the CFD analysis results, PTMS is chosen to be applied in this battery pack design. Further structural analysis of the battery pack with PTMS confirms the reliability of modal and vibration performances. After Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation, a prototype pack of the battery is built. The thermal management performance of the battery pack is tested on a test bench in a thermal chamber. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the CFD analysis results and prove the effectiveness of the parallel structure in temperature control.

AB According to the operating characteristics of high-power battery pack in practical application, the effects of four factors, which include operating load, state of charge(SOC), ambient temperature and operating temperature, on the temperature uniformity and rising rate of battery pack under natural convection were studied based on Arbin test bench. The results indicate that: the operating load and SOC of battery pack doesn't affect its temperature uniformity, which was deteriorated as the increasing of operating temperature of battery pack, or improved as the increasing of ambient temperature when the other factor is kept constant. The increment of operating load or ambient temperature could result in a higher temperature rising rate, while the increasing of SOC or operating temperature could lead to a lower temperature rising rate, when the other three factors are kept constant. When the operating temperature or temperature differences achieved threshold value, thermal management system should choose proper extent of forced flow and flow field in accordance with the battery pack's current operating conditions, in order to ensure the economy of the thermal management system.

The cell's internal temperature is an important factor for its degradation, but it cannot be measured directly. Based on the measured surface temperature and a lumped thermal model for the battery pack, an adaptive observer is designed to estimate the internal temperature and internal resistance of a cell in battery packs at the same time. The capability of the adaptive observer could be beneficial for thermal management and battery health monitoring. Finally, simulation results show the good performance of the adaptive observer.

ID PHASE-CHANGE MATERIAL; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION; MODEL
AB A new design of thermal management system for lithium ion battery pack using thermoelectric coolers (TECs) is proposed. Firstly, the 3D thermal model of a high power lithium ion battery and the TEC is elaborated. Then the model is calibrated with experiment results. Finally, the calibrated model is applied to investigate the performance of a thermal management system for a lithium ion battery pack. The results show that battery thermal management system (BTMS) with TEC can cool the battery in very high ambient temperature. It can also keep a more uniform temperature distribution in the battery pack than common BTMS, which will extend the life of the battery pack and may save the expensive battery equalization system.

AB Fluid flow and heat transfer of a power li-ion battery pack which adopts the air cooling method with an electric fan are predicted using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The airflow rate distributions at coolant passages are analyzed quantificationally, which will affect temperature distribution of the battery pack. Temperatures at the center of battery surface that are located in the middle of each battery modules are monitored using thermal couples under the same driving cycle as simulation. The simulation results are close to the experimental ones, which indicate that the calculated results can be used as the basis of developing thermal management strategy of battery pack and optimization scheme of fluid flow.

AB Nowadays, a large number of different electrochemical energy storage systems are known. In the last two decades the development was strongly driven by a continuously growing market of portable electronic devices (e.g. cellular phones, lap top computers, camcorders, cameras, tools). Current intensive efforts are under way to develop systems for automotive industry within the framework of electrically propelled mobility (e.g. hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, full electric vehicles) and also for the energy storage market (e.g. electrical grid stability, renewable energies). Besides the different systems (cell chemistries), electrochemical cells and batteries were developed and are offered in many shapes, sizes and designs, in order to meet performance and design requirements of the widespread applications. Proper packaging is thereby one important technological step for designing optimum, reliable and safe batteries for operation.
   In this contribution, current packaging approaches of cells and batteries together with the corresponding materials are discussed. The focus is laid on rechargeable systems for industrial applications (i.e. alkaline systems, lithium-ion, lead-acid). In principle, four different cell types (shapes) can be identified - button, cylindrical, prismatic and pouch. Cell size can be either in accordance with international (e.g. International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC) or other standards or can meet application-specific dimensions. Since cell housing or container, terminals and, if necessary, safety installations as inactive (non-reactive) materials reduce energy density of the battery, the development of low-weight packages is a challenging task. In addition to that, other requirements have to be fulfilled: mechanical stability and durability, sealing (e.g. high permeation barrier against humidity for lithium-ion technology), high packing efficiency, possible installation of safety devices (current interrupt device, valve, etc.), chemical inertness, cost issues, and others. Finally, proper cell design has to be considered for effective thermal management (i.e. cooling and heating) of battery packs.

AB A 3-D module of power battery thermal management unit with phase change material is formulated. The cold start-up time of air heating is 4.2 times of phase change material heating from 243.15 to 283.15 K. The temperature difference decreases from 9.9 to 4.6 degrees C when the thermal conductivity of the phase change material increases to five times. The heat transports from the domain near an electrode can reheat the domain away from the electrode and make the thermal energy distributing more even inside the battery. A well-designed thermal management system with phase change material is positive for power battery applying under cold temperature.

AB Power battery pack under high-rate discharge conditions produces thermal aggregation phenomena. Generated heat during charging and discharging that distributes in battery pack affects performance of battery and so that shortens its life. So the battery pack thermal management is necessary to electric vehicles. In this paper, an ideal thermal management solution is put forward with a battery pack temperature equilibrium approach and a battery pack overall thermal dissipation structure by finite element analysis. Theoretical analysis result shows that the thermal management solution can effectively cool the battery pack to the ideal working temperature range 25 similar to 40 degrees C and improve the battery pack temperature uniformity with the maximum temperature difference which is below 5 degrees C, which enhance the cycle life of power battery pack for electric vehicle applications.

AB This paper reviews the heat dissipation performance of battery pack with different structures (including: longitudinal battery pack, horizontal battery pack, and changing the position of air-inlet and air-outlet) and operation conditions (including: SOC state, charge and discharge rate, and practical operation condition), and finally arrives at the conclusions as follows: the average thermal power of 55 Ah lithium-ion battery monomer decreases along with environment temperature rising, SOC state decreasing and charge and discharge rate falling; the maximum temperature rising and temperature difference of battery pack are not only relevant to the flow rate, but also related to the airflow duct structure, the battery pack with air-inlets on both sides is more conducive to the forced air cooling; the flow rate of battery pack at 70% SOC state is maximum, the maximum temperature rising and temperature difference of battery pack at 70% SOC state are minimum, and that of 90% SOC state are maximum; the flow rate and the average pressure drop between air-inlet and air-outlet both decrease along with charge and discharge rate increasing, but the maximum temperature rising and temperature difference of battery pack increase; as considering the practical operation condition of battery pack, the charge and discharge rate is between 0.5 C and 0.8 C, and the maximum temperature rising and maximum temperature difference of battery pack are 7.61 degrees C and 4.29 degrees C. Then the reference basis for heat flow field characteristic analysis and structure design of battery pack are offered. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene and few-layer graphene reveal exceptionally high thermal conduction properties, which can be used for thermal management. Here we show that incorporation of graphene and few-layer graphene to the hydrocarbon-based phase change material allows one to increase its thermal conductivity by more than two orders of magnitude while preserving its latent heat storage ability. A combination of the sensible and latent heat storage together with the improved heat conduction results in a composite material with the exceptional thermal management capabilities. We show that the graphene-enhanced phase change material can substantially improve the thermal management of Li-ion and other advanced types of batteries.

ID AGING MECHANISMS
AB While a great number of battery balancing circuit topologies have been proposed, the unique control objective typically pursued is equalization of single cell charge. However, a balancing circuit could offer potentially more control features, especially with topologies able to provide bidirectional power flow control. This has not been explored yet in literature or at least not with enough thoroughness. Thus, in addition to charge balancing, up to three more objectives could be pursued simultaneously. Firstly, virtual resistance control, in order to provide dynamic compensation for variations in terminal cell voltage. Secondly, thermal management, to achieve a more uniform temperature distribution within a battery pack. Third, on-board diagnosis or fault detection tools, e.g. to perform characterization tests or to identify and even isolate problematic cells. In this paper, this issue is discussed and evaluated for a battery pack made up of 48 large format Li-Ion cells in series in a e-mobility application. Simulation results demonstrate the technical feasibility of this newly defined concept.

AB An experimental study of lithium-ion battery thermal behaviour for automotive applications is presented. Experiments are conducted for a pack of three battery cells which encounter a series of different discharge and cooling conditions. Results show the different temperature distribution on different locations of the battery cell surface with the highest temperature increase near the positive and negative electrode. The temperature increases sharply if the state of charge (SOC) is too small (less then 20%). Higher discharge rate contributes to higher temperature increase and bigger maximum and minimum temperature difference. Higher cooling air velocity helps to decrease the overall temperature and create better cell surface temperature distribution. Battery utilisation under real vehicle driving conditions is simulated using NEDC and Artemis rural driving cycle with different cooling strategies. Various information collected throughout this project are important in understanding the battery thermal behaviour and help in the design of better cooling systems and strategies for a better used of lithium-ion batteries in automotive applications.

AB Nowadays, electric vehicles fill a relevant car market share. The Li-Ion batteries currently represent the best solution in term of environmental impact and performance. Thermal management for Li-Ion batteries is a very interesting topic, since high temperatures accelerate degradation rate of a cell and compromise its safety level. The battery thermal modeling can be quite challenging. The proposed approach describes a methodology to simulate different thermal management algorithms in order to obtain an uniform temperature distribution in a Li-Ion battery pack. A test case has been developed where the application of an thermal algorithm has been analyzed through CFD simulations.

AB This paper presents an intelligent energy management for electric vehicles (EVs) which contains automatic charging mechanism. Nowadays EVs charging the battery pack by using road side stations, park stations etc. are increase the travel time. To overcome this problem we have proposed an automatic charging with an intelligent energy management system using Kalman filtering (IEMK) capable for estimating and controlling the battery packs. Energy and battery management in EV is difficult and important under driving condition. This paper mainly focuses to estimate different parameters such as available power, state of charge, and thermal management. The algorithm has been implemented for the battery packs to maintain charging by both the solar and wind energy systems. IEMK provides optimal mean for estimating the parameters of battery pack and accurate under running condition. Simulation results show that the proposed method is stable, state of charge with 1 % error, and robust compared with other systems.

AB In this paper, a novel design including cooling media for packing the rechargeable Lithium (Li)-ion batteries used in hybrid and electric vehicles is proposed. The proposed battery pack satisfies all thermal and physical issues relating to the battery packs used in vehicles such as operating temperature range and volume, and furthermore it increases the battery life cycle and charge and discharge performances. The temperature and voltage distributions of the proposed battery pack are calculated using the characteristics of a sample Li-ion battery and heat transfer principles. The proposed battery pack uses several distributed thin ducts for cooling which is based on distributed natural convection. Ultra uniform voltage and temperature distributions, minimum temperature dispersion in each battery unit, minimum increase in the battery pack volume, natural convection (no extra energy consumption for cooling), the maximum observed temperature less than that in other proposed battery packs and high thermal performance for different ambient temperatures until 48 degrees C are some advantages of the proposed Li-ion battery pack including proposed distributed cooling media. Simulation results and a comparison between the parameters of the proposed cooling media and other related work are presented to validate the theoretical results and to prove the superiority of the proposed battery pack design.

AB Further developing a study presented in Di Domenico, Prada, and Creff (2011), this paper presents an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on an electro-thermal model for the estimation of the internal state of a lithium-ion battery, i.e. state of charge and the cell overpotential. In order to compensate for uncertainties in the model parameters and in the measurements, it is first shown that the filter robustness strongly depends on the State of Charge (SOC) range. Then the filter weights are adapted according to the estimated SOC value. This estimation technique is tested using experimental data collected from a commercial A123 Systems lithium iron phosphate/graphite (LiFePO4/graphite) cell. The filter shows good performance. The estimation of SOC exhibits an average error within 3% range and the overpotential is estimated with a precision higher than 5 mV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional thermal management systems for lithium-ion batteries remove heat from the exterior surface of the battery, causing undesirable temperature increase and thermal gradients inside the battery. Internally cooling batteries can reduce both of these effects, improving safety and durability. In the present study, a novel internal cooling system that utilizes passive, liquid-vapor phase change processes is investigated using representative geometry and a surrogate heat source. Frictional and heat transfer characteristics of the representative cooling system with buoyancy driven flow are reported over a range of net heat inputs (94-6230 W L-1) and saturation temperatures (24 degrees C-33 degrees C). The results show that the mass flow rate increased to a maximum near a heat input of 1350 W L-1, and there was a slight influence of saturation temperature on the performance of the system. In addition, the calculated two-phase frictional pressure drops in the microchannel evaporator (3.175 mm x 160 mu m channels) are compared to the representative correlation database (D-h < 1 mm) and used to develop a new frictional pressure drop model with improved accuracy over the tested mass flux range (45 < G < 112 kg m(-2) s(-1)). The results presented here are utilized in a subsequent investigation to determine the performance improvement in large lithium-ion battery packs intended for electric and hybrid electric vehicular applications through internal cooling.

A series of tests are conducted using an accelerating rate calorimeter to promote an adiabatic environment. Cell heat capacity is identified and the overall heat generated is quantified. Cell entropy is measured, using both potentiometric and calorimetric methods. The part of reversible reaction in the overall thermal behaviour is determined during charge-discharge tests and compared to joule losses. The influence of the state-of-charge variation and the impact of charge-discharge current rate on battery heat generation are highlighted. Experimental results for two lithium-ion technologies are presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pseudo two dimensional electrochemical coupled with lumped thermal model has been developed to analyze the electrochemical and thermal behavior of the commercial 18650 Lithium Iron Phosphate battery. The cell was cut to obtain the physical dimension of the current collector, electrodes, separator, casing thickness, gasket, etc. The layer structure of the spiral wound, cylindrical casing, gasket and heat shrink wrapping were modeled to understand better the temperature distribution across the cell. Natural convection and radiation were used to reflect the heat dissipation on the side surface. Experimental study was carried out to validate the simulation results. The simulation results suggested that the cell temperature and total heat generation rate have a positive correlation with the I-t-rates and these were inline with the experimental results. Reaction heat was the main heat source and it contributed about 80-85% of the total heat generated during charging and discharging of the cell. Based on the simulation results, the final temperature of the cell surface was elevated to 59 degrees C using 10I(t) of charging. The effect of electrical contact resistance between the connectors and terminals of the cell was also investigated. It was found that the electrical contact resistance caused a large temperature gradient across the cell. These effects are important and should be considered in the design of EV battery pack and thermal management system to reduce the maximum temperature and maintain the temperature uniformity of the cells.

AB Advanced electrochemical batteries are becoming an integral part of a wide range of applications from household and commercial to smart grid, transportation, and aerospace applications. Among different battery technologies, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are growing more and more popular due to their high energy density, high galvanic potential, low self-discharge, low weight, and the fact that they have almost no memory effect. However, one of the main obstacles facing the widespread commercialization of Li-ion batteries is the design of reliable battery management systems (BMSs). An efficient BMS ensures electrical safety during operation, while increasing battery lifetime, capacity and thermal stability. Despite the need for extensive research in this field, the majority of research conducted on Li-ion battery packs and BMS are proprietary works conducted by manufacturers. The available literature, however, provides either general descriptions or detailed analysis of individual components of the battery system, and ignores addressing details of the overall system development. This paper addresses the development of an experimental research testbed for studying Li-ion batteries and their BMS design. The testbed can be configured in a variety of cell and pack architectures, allowing for a wide range of BMS monitoring, diagnostics, and control technologies to be tested and analyzed. General considerations that should be taken into account while designing Li-ion battery systems are reviewed and different technologies and challenges commonly encountered in Li-ion battery systems are investigated. This testbed facilitates future development of more practical and improved BMS technologies with the aim of increasing the safety, reliability, and efficiency of existing Li-ion battery systems. Experimental results of initial tests performed on the system are used to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the developed research testbed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that addresses, at the same time, the practical battery system development issues along with the theoretical and technological challenges from cell to pack level.

AB Lithium ion batteries are commonly employed in hybrid electric vehicles and achieving high energy density in the battery has been among the most critical issues in the automotive industry. Since thermal management is very important in the automotive batteries with layout limitation, a design strategy for effective cooling should be carefully opted. Particularly, a forced air cooling has been considered as a practical option in the automotive industry. In this article, a specific design of air-cooled battery system is theoretically investigated and numerically modelled to satisfy the required thermal specifications. Since a typical battery system in hybrid electric vehicles consists of the stacked multiple battery cells, cooling performance is determined mainly by the uniform distribution of air flow in the coolant passage which dissipates heat generated from the battery cells. It is demonstrated that the required cooling performance can be achieved by employing the tapered manifold and pressure relief ventilation even without changing the layout/design of the existing battery system. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis is performed as a design guideline to enhance the cooling performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work studied the thermal management of lithium ion batteries both numerically and experimentally. Numerically, a two dimensional CFD (computational fluid dynamics) model has been developed to perform detailed simulations of the thermal management issues within a battery pack cooled by air. Experimentally, systematic tests were performed to provide datasets to validate the CFD model. The main components in the experimental facility included a multi-cell battery pack and a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel facility generated well-controlled cooling air flow with velocity up to 30 m s(-1) (similar to 67 miles per hour). So that the study can be performed under flow conditions directly relevant to practice. The major contributions from this combined numerical-experimental study are threefold. First, the CFD model has been shown to capture the dynamics of the cooling of battery modules consisting of multiple battery cells, including temperature non-uniformity among cells. Second, the CFD simulations have been compared directly against experimental data to quantify the accuracy and validity of the CFD models. Third, based on the validated CFD models, a reduced-order model is developed to predict the maximum cell temperature in the battery module. The accuracy and simplicity of the reduced-order model makes it promising for in situ monitoring and control purposes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An accurate thermal model to predict the heat generation in rechargeable batteries is an essential tool for advanced thermal management in high power applications, such as electric vehicles. For such applications, the battery materials' details and cell design are normally not provided. In this work a simple, though accurate, thermal model for batteries has been developed, considering the temperature- and current-dependent overpotential heat generation and State-of-Charge dependent entropy contributions. High power rechargeable Li-ion (7.5 Ah) batteries have been experimentally investigated and the results are used for model verification. It is shown that the State-of-Charge dependent entropy is a significant heat source and is therefore essential to correctly predict the thermal behavior of Li-ion batteries under a wide variety of operating conditions. An adaptive model is introduced to obtain these entropy values. A temperature-dependent equation for heat transfer to the environment is also taken into account. Good agreement between the simulations and measurements is obtained in all cases. The parameters for both the heat generation and heat transfer processes can be applied to the thermal design of advanced battery packs. The proposed methodology is generic and independent on the cell chemistry and battery design. The parameters for the adaptive model can be determined by performing simple cell potential/current and temperature measurements for a limited number of charge/discharge cycles.

AB The performance and life expectancy of ultracapacitors depend heavily on the operating voltage and temperature. In this paper, simultaneous estimation of state-of-charge (SOC) and temperature is achieved by applying extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm with only the terminal measurement of voltage and current. For the application of EKF algorithm, a nonlinear model which consists of a voltage-and-thermal-dependent equivalent circuit model and a thermal model is first developed. The parameters in the equivalent circuit model are identified by applying least squares method with weightings at different frequencies so as to achieve satisfactory prediction over the whole applicable frequency ranges. Experimental results demonstrate that the EKF-based estimator is crucial in providing accurate and consistent prediction of SOC and temperature in existence of modeling errors and measurement noises, especially during dynamic charge/discharge cycles at low temperature. The accurate estimation of SOC and temperature enables optimum energy and thermal management of ultracapacitors. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal management is critically important to maintain the performance of lithium ion battery stacks. In this study, a numerical model and an analytical model for the thermal management of lithium ion battery stacks are developed to investigate the thermal behaviors of flat-plate and cylindrical stacks during discharging processes. It is found that for the same volume ratio of cooling channel and battery of flat-plate design, changing the channel size and the number of channels results in similar average battery temperatures, however, increasing the channel size improves the cooling energy efficiency but leads to more unevenly distributed temperature, and vice versa. The volume ratio of cooling channel to battery needs to be higher than 0.014 for flat-plate design when the Reynolds number of cooling air is around 2000 or higher with a high discharging rate of 2 C. The cylindrical battery stacks considered in this study are generally less compact and more energy-efficient in cooling than the flat-plate battery stacks, and the general thermal behaviors are similar between these two designs. A counter-flow arrangement of the cooling channels or changing the flow direction of the co-flow arrangement periodically may also help the thermal management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Effective heat transfer and protection against high operating temperatures are important, lifetime-affecting items in the design and operation of batteries, especially those intended for hybrid mobile working machines, where the peak power and current demands are high. This paper describes a methodology for the modeling of the electrical and thermal behavior of lithium ion pouch cells for hybrid mobile working machines. The model is produced by coupling the equivalent electrical circuit of the pouch cell and the 3-D pouch cell thermal model. The temperature dependence of the battery operation parameters is added to the model in order to analyze the influence of temperature on heat generation during battery operation. Determination of the parameters of the thermal model is carried out empirically based on the presented methodology, which allows the construction of a 3-D thermal model of a pouch cell without requiring detailed information about the battery chemistry. The validity of the modeling procedure is demonstrated experimentally for a 60 Ah lithium titanate pouch cell.

An Arrhenius equation-based mathematical model is firstly identified to quantify the effect of temperature on the cell lifetime of a Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery pack. The cell aging datasets collected under multiple ambient temperatures are applied to extract the Arrhenius equation parameters. The model is then used as an assessment criterion and guidance for the thermal management design of battery packs. The feasibility and applicability of a pack structure with its cooling system, is then evaluated, and its design problems are studied by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The performance and eligibility of the design method is validated by both CFD simulations and experiments.

AB This work considers the impact of thermal behavior in battery design. The cell performance worsens when the operating temperature falls outside of the ideal range, and evenness of cell temperatures is sought to prevent cell electrical unbalance which may lead to performance fading and premature failure. The heat transfer between the cells and the coolant depends on the cell packaging and layout. A multi-objective optimization model is posed whose Pareto efficient designs minimize cell temperature deviations while maintaining evenness of temperature distribution. The special characteristics of the battery design problem (comparable objectives, anonymity and Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers) make it suitable for the application of the equitability preference, which is a refinement of the Pareto optimality that has not been used in engineering design. The proposed approach based on equitability is applied to compute the spacing of the cylindrical cells in a battery module that yields an optimal thermal behavior.

AB Presented study discusses the development of a finite differencing (FD) thermal model for a power-split hybrid configuration employing a nickel-metal hydride battery pack. A resistancecapacitance electro-thermal model is used to couple the experimental boundary conditions (current, voltage, state of charge, and temperature) with the modeled battery resistance to capture its electro-chemical behavior and the cell exothermic reactions. Battery current, voltage, and temperature (discrete and full field) for a vehicle with a power-split hybrid configuration were collected under different standard (Federal Highway Driving Schedule and Federal Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (FUDS)) and artificially generated driving cycles. This manuscript analyzes the battery current and voltage in relation to vehicle speed and shows how the proposed FD model predicts the spatial and temporal temperature profiles of the power train in good agreement with the vehicle data as reported by the on-board diagnostics module.

AB A new approach of Thermal Impedance Spectroscopy (TIS) is introduced for thermal characterization of battery cells. It examines the transfer behavior between internal heat generation and resulting battery surface temperature in the frequency domain. Compared to previously published TIS methods the internal heat generation forced by electrical operation can be determined without any previous knowledge or assumptions on the electric/electrochemical behavior of the battery cell. The complete procedure is demonstrated by the TIS-application on a cylindrical High-Power Li-Ion cell. By the use of a thermal battery model, its theoretical transfer function can be fitted to the TIS-measurement results in the Nyquist-Plot. Consequently, the specific heat capacity and the heat conductivity of the cell's jelly roll can be derived. A comparison of the exemplary operated TIS to conventional thermal characterization methods shows a difference of 5% in the heat capacity and 12% in the heat conductivity determination. Future improvements on the experimental setup are suggested in order to reach a higher measurement accuracy and additionally, the systematic advantages of the easy to operate and non-destructive TIS-method are presented.

AB This article mainly addresses the technology of improving heat dissipation performance of power battery packs using Phase Change Material (PCM). This new technology aims to reduce the temperature gradient among the battery packs. As the thermal properties of the pure paraffin wax are hard to meet the dissipation demand, changes are made to add graphite particles into it. Commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT is used to simulate the heat dissipation process during battery discharge using PCM and traditional forced air cooling methods. The simulation results show that both under constant current and pulse current the maximal temperature and temperature gradient by the end of discharging using PCM method are relatively lower than that of using forced air cooling method.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have been considered as one of the effective solutions to current energy and environment concerns. One of the challenges regarding the energy storage system (ESS) of today's electric vehicles, which are batteries, is the capacity fade. It is of great importance to identify and analyze the factors contributing to the capacity loss and predict the cell degradation. In this manuscript, an advanced systematic Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery cell model is proposed to estimate the battery cell State-of-Charge (SOC), cell internal temperature, and battery cycle-lifetime. The accuracy of the proposed model is examined and verified through comparative analyses. Based on the proposed battery model, the impact of various factors, such as discharge current rate, temperature, peak discharge current and Depth-of-Discharge (DoD) and their effects on battery cell capacity loss and cycle-lifetime are investigated and studied.

AB In mobile and stationary battery systems, lifetime expectancy is a key parameter for the calculation of monetary effectiveness. It significantly affects return on investment and therefore is a key parameter for the market breakthrough of the desired battery application. Battery life is influenced by two different factors, namely electrical utilization and environmental conditions. As higher temperatures lead to a faster deterioration of the lithium-ion battery, smart thermal design can not only increase battery lifetime, but also reduce cooling costs and improve overall efficiency. It is therefore essential to establish an effective thermal design through perfoming electrothermal modeling and characterization of the battery cell, battery module and fully assembled battery pack. In this paper, the motivation for electrothermal modeling of lithium-ion battery cells and modules is introduced and design challenges are identified for applications in mobile and stationary battery systems. An electrothermal model of batteries with appropriate cell chemistry for mobile and stationary applications is developed with focus on further implementation in thermal simulation of battery modules and packs. The parameterization process of the presented models is shown and a model of battery cells with derived parameters is presented. Finally, the electrothermal model is verified experimentally.

AB A smart battery thermal management is crucial for vehicle performances and battery lifetime targets achievements when electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are concerned. The thermal system needs to be designed and tuned in accordance and compromises with powertrain and vehicle requirements, battery pack architecture, environmental constraints, costs, weight, etc., in a process that will be described in the first part of this paper. Among the portfolio of battery thermal management technologies, these items will be illustrated by two examples: thermal management by cabin air and by refrigerant in a direct cooling, enlightening a decision process. A simplified battery thermo-electric simulation model, which the second part of our work focuses on, has been built, first for both thermal and energetic balance dimensioning of the battery thermal management system. Examples are given on these two perspectives. That simplified simulation model has also identified some promising thermal management strategies for improving vehicle efficiency and performances and battery lifetime. That is the task of the last part of this paper. Battery heating has shown opportunities for improving energy and power availability at cold conditions and, thus, electric drive availability and autonomy. Post-cooling the battery at the end of a journey and its pre-conditioning before the following journey, not only improve vehicle efficiency, electric drive availability and autonomy, but also enhance battery lifetime and compromises with cabin thermal comfort. Others promising strategies optimizing the relation between vehicle performances and battery lifetime are still under investigations.

AB Although the battery surface temperature is commonly measured, the core temperature of a cell may be much higher hence more critical than the surface temperature. The core temperature of a battery, though usually unmeasured in commercial applications, can be estimated by an observer, based on a lumped-parameter battery thermal model and the measurement of the current and the surface temperature. Even with a closed loop observer based on the measured surface temperature, the accuracy of the core temperature estimation depends on the model parameters. For such purpose, an online parameterization methodology and an adaptive observer are designed for a cylindrical battery. The single cell thermal model is then scaled up to create a battery cluster model to investigate the temperature pattern of the cluster The modeled thermal interconnections between cells include cell to cell heat conduction and convection to the surrounding coolant flow. An observability analysis is performed on the cluster before designing a closed loop observer for the pack. Based on the analysis, guidelines for determining the minimum number of required sensors and their exact locations are derived that guarantee the observability of all temperature states.

AB Control oriented battery pack models can be very useful in the context of electrified vehicle development because such models can be used to develop the battery management system, which is a broad term that encompasses everything from thermal management and charge balancing to state of charge estimation. In this paper, a control oriented battery pack model is developed using the Modelica modeling environment. This model combines a Randle equivalent circuit representation with an lumped parameter thermal model for each cell to provide simultaneously the electrical and thermal variations among the cells. Modelica differs from modeling environment such as Simulink because it offers non-causal modeling, which handles both differential and algebraic equations. The resulting implementation is both scalable and flexible to accomodate any pack size, geometry, and connection. As part of the future work, supporting architectures such as the charge balancing system and thermal management system can be added to the pack model to simulate the complete pack operation.

AB Battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential for electric-vehicle (EV) and hybrid-vehicle (HV) battery packs to operate effectively in all climates. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries offer many advantages to the EV such as high power and high specific energy. However, temperature affects their performance, safety, and productive life. This paper is about the design and evaluation of a BTMS based on the Peltier effect heat pumps. The discharge efficiency of a 60-Ah prismatic Li-ion pouch cell was measured under different rates and different ambient temperature values. The obtained results were used to design a solid-state BTMS based on Peltier thermoelectric coolers (TECs). The proposed BTMS is then modeled and evaluated at constant current discharge in the laboratory. In addition, The BTMS was installed in an EV that was driven in the US06 cycle. The thermal response and the energy consumption of the proposed BTMS were satisfactory.

AB Thermal issues associated with electric vehicle battery packs can significantly affect performance and life cycle. Fundamental heat transfer principles and performance characteristics of commercial lithium-ion battery are used to predict the temperature distributions in a typical battery pack under a range of discharge conditions. Various cooling strategies are implemented to examine the relationship between battery thermal behavior and design parameters. By studying the effect of cooling conditions and pack configuration on battery temperature, information is obtained as to how to maintain operating temperature by designing proper battery configuration and choosing proper cooling systems. It was found that a cooling strategy based on distributed forced convection is an efficient, cost-effective method which can provide uniform temperature and voltage distributions within the battery pack at various discharge rates.
