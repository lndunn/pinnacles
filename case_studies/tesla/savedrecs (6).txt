AB This paper reports both the experimental and numerical study of the thermal management of a Li-ion battery module consisting of multiple cylindrical cells under dynamic loads. The numerical study includes both detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and reduced-order modeling (ROM) modeling. A series of experiments and numerical simulations on different conditions were performed to design the optimal cooling strategy for the module, in terms of the maximum temperature rise and parasitic power consumption. The major contribution from this work is the design of a controller-based cooling scheme that can reduce the parasitic power consumption considerably while maintaining the temperature rise within optimal range under various dynamic loading conditions (such as the urban assault cycle, UAC). The design of the cooling scheme was accomplished in three steps. First, experiments of different cooling schemes were performed under controlled conditions in wind tunnel. Second, experimental data obtained from the first step were used to develop and validate the CFD and ROM models. And third, the validated ROM was then used to simulate and design controller-based cooling strategies for battery modules under practical dynamic load profiles such as the UAC profile.

AB Modern applications of lithium-ion batteries such as smartphones, hybrid & electric vehicles and grid scale electricity storage demand long lifetime and high performance which typically makes them the limiting factor in a system. Understanding the state-of-health during operation is important in order to optimise for long term durability and performance. However, this requires accurate in-operando diagnostic techniques that are cost effective and practical. We present a novel diagnosis method based upon differential thermal voltammetry demonstrated on a battery pack made from commercial lithium-ion cells where one cell was deliberately aged prior to experiment. The cells were in parallel whilst being thermally managed with forced air convection. We show for the first time, a diagnosis method capable of quantitatively determining the state-of-health of four cells simultaneously by only using temperature and voltage readings for both charge and discharge. Measurements are achieved using low-cost thermocouples and a single voltage measurement at a frequency of 1 Hz, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing this approach on real world battery management systems. The technique could be particularly useful under charge when constant current or constant power is common, this therefore should be of significant interest to all lithium-ion battery users.

AB In order to improve the temperature uniformity inside the battery, the effects of partially utilizing metal and nonmetal materials on the heat sink of an air-cooled Lithium-ion ( Li-ion) battery module were studied. Aluminum and aluminum foam as heat conductors and ceramic, and ceramic foam as insulators were examined using two-dimensional transient numerical simulation. The effects of the length of utilizing each material to the total length of the battery pack from the inlet by assuming that the other part of the heat sink is aluminum were investigated. The results showed that using aluminum foam and ceramic as part of the heat sink decreases the temperature uniformity of the battery pack. However, using the ceramic foam at the inlet section of the heat sink improves the temperature uniformity of the battery significantly. Furthermore, partially inserting the aluminum foam inside the air flow channel from outlet was investigated, and significant enhancement on the temperature uniformity of the battery pack was found. Overall, higher temperature reduction and higher temperature uniformity were achieved inside the battery pack using the combination of both ceramic and aluminum foams.

AB This paper reports the experimental study of the active control of the thermal management for prismatic lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries under an elevated thermal environment with temperature above 40 degrees C. To defray the cost of performing experimental study under such conditions while obtaining meaningful data for a multi-cell battery pack with practical relevance, this study developed an experimental setup using a combination of four real Li-ion cells and 12 dummy cells. The dummy cells were fabricated to have the same geometry as the real cells and embedded with controllable heating elements to simulate, respectively, the aerodynamic and thermal behavior of a multi-cell pack. This experimental setup was then placed inside a wind tunnel so actively controlled cooling tests can be performed under well controlled flow conditions. During the tests, heating power up to 6 x 10(4) W/m(3) was generated by the dummy cells, creating and the maximum environment temperature above 40 degrees C. The major observations obtained from these experiments were twofold. First, besides reducing the experimental cost, the combination of real and dummy cells also offers flexibility to obtain experimental data of a large pack under a variety of conditions for model comparison. Second, a simple on-and-off control strategy was demonstrated to effectively reduce the parasitic power consumption of the cooling systems under the evaluated environmental temperature, even when the Li-ion cells were under dynamic load.

AB While Li-ion cells offer excellent energy conversion and storage capabilities for multiple applications, including electric vehicles, heat removal from a Li-ion cell remains a serious technological challenge that directly limits performance, and poses serious safety concerns. Due to poor thermal conductivity of Li-ion cells, traditional cooling methods like air cooling on the cell surface do not effectively access and cool the core. This may lead to overheating of the cell core. This paper investigates the cooling of Li-ion cells using an annular channel through the axis of the cell. Air flow through this channel and heat pipe insertion are both shown to result in effective cooling. A temperature reduction of 18-20 degrees C in the cell core is observed in heat pipe experiments, depending on heat pipe size, for 1.62 W heat dissipation. Similar effect is observed when a thin metal rod is used instead of a heat pipe. Experimental measurements are close to finite-element simulation results. Experiments demonstrate that a heat pipe successfully prevents overheating in case of sudden increase in heat generation due to malfunction such as cell shorting. This paper illustrates fundamental thermal-electrochemical trade-offs, and facilitates the development of novel and effective cooling techniques for Li-ion cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As an important method for battery thermal management, traditional phase change material (PCM) technology is facing challenges due to the relatively low thermal conductivity, weak skeleton strength and/or leakage phenomenon of PCM. Herein we develop a copper mesh (CM)-enhanced paraffin (PA)/expanded graphite (EG) composite as a composite PCM for battery thermal management. EG with porous structure can absorb liquid phase PA, preventing PA leakage. CM acts as a skeleton to further enhance both the thermal conductivity and strength of the whole module. As a result, the as-constructed CM enhanced PCM of PA/EG plate (PCMP) presents much better heat dissipation performance and temperature uniformity compared to PCMP without CM, especially in harsh working conditions. Moreover, with forced air convection, copper fins exposed from the composite may play a crucial role in not only heat dissipation, but also disturbing the air flow, and thus further strengthen the heat transfer capability.

AB Thermal management is indispensable to lithium-ion battery pack especially within high power energy storage device and system. To investigate the thermal performance of lithium-ion battery pack, a type of liquid cooling method based on mini-channel cold-plate is used and the three-dimensional numerical model was established in this paper. The effects of number of channels, inlet mass flow rate, flow direction and width of channels on the thermal behaviors of the battery pack were analyzed. The results showed that the mini-channel cold-plate thermal management system provided good cooling efficiency in controlling the battery temperature at 5C discharge. A 5-channel cold-plate was enough and the temperature could be evidently reduced by increasing the inlet mass flow rate. Additionally, for the bad temperature uniformity in the design 1, design 2 was proposed and compared with the design 1. The maximum temperature and temperature difference decreased 13.3% and 43.3%, respectively. Temperature uniformity was significantly improved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal management is critical for large-scale, shipboard energy storage systems utilizing lithium-ion batteries. In recent years, there has been growing research in thermal management of lithium-ion battery modules. However,, there is little information available on the minimum cell-to-cell spacing limits for indirect, liquid cooled modules when considering heat release during a single cell failure. For this purpose, a generic four-cell module was modeled using finite element analysis to determine the sensitivity of module temperatures to cell spacing. Additionally, the effects of different heat sink materials and interface qualities were investigated. Two materials were considered, a solid aluminum block and a metal/wax composite block. Simulations were run for three different transient load profiles. The first profile simulates sustained high rate operation where the system begins at rest and generates heat continuously until it reaches steady state. And, two failure mode simulations were conducted to investigate block performance during a slow and a fast exothermic reaction, respectively. Results indicate that composite materials can perform well under normal operation and provide some protection against single cell failure; although, for very compact designs, the amount of wax available to absorb heat is reduced and the effectiveness of the phase change material is diminished. The aluminum block design performed well under all conditions, and showed that heat generated during a failure is quickly dissipated to the coolant, even under the closest cell spacing configuration.

AB Typically, the unique objective pursued in either active or passive balancing is equalization of single cell charge. However, a balancing circuit may offer more control features, like virtual equalization of single cell internal resistance or thermal balancing. Such control features for balancing systems are evaluated in this paper by means of convex optimization. More than one hundred cases in a pure EV application are evaluated. Balancing circuits' efficiency models are implemented and realistic cell-to-cell parameter distributions are considered based on experimental data. Different battery sizes and driving cycles are considered. Balancing circuit topology is taken into account by selecting a specific category of energy transfer: cell-to-heat, bypass, cell-to-pack, pack-to-cell, cell-to-cell shared, cell-to-cell distributed or cell-to-pack-to-cell. In general, better results in terms of energy losses, available capacity or temperature are obtained for the last three categories, even for moderate balancing currents. In particular, remarkable improvements are observed under conditions of high power demand with high variability, i.e., smaller battery sizes and more demanding driving cycles.

AB Power train electrification is promoted as a potential alternative to reduce carbon intensity of transportation. Lithium-ion batteries are found to be suitable for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and pure electric vehicles (EVs), and temperature control on lithium batteries is vital for long-term performance and durability. Unfortunately, battery thermal management (BTM) has not been paid close attention partly due to poor understanding of battery thermal behaviour. Cell performance change dramatically with temperature, but it improves with temperature if a suitable operating temperature window is sustained. This paper provides a review on two aspects that are battery thermal model development and thermal management strategies. Thermal effects of lithium-ion batteries in terms of thermal runaway and response under cold temperatures will be studied, and heat generation methods are discussed with aim of performing accurate battery thermal analysis. In addition, current BTM strategies utilised by automotive suppliers will be reviewed to identify the imposing challenges and critical gaps between research and practice. Optimising existing BTMs and exploring new technologies to mitigate battery thermal impacts are required, and efforts in prioritising BTM should be made to improve the temperature uniformity across the battery pack, prolong battery lifespan, and enhance the safety of large packs.

AB Understanding the rate of heat generation in a lithium-ion cell is critical for its safety and performance behavior. This paper presents in situ measurements of the heat generation rate for a prismatic Lithium-ion battery at 1C, 2C, 3C and 4C discharge rates and 5 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C boundary conditions (BCs). For this work, an aluminum-laminated battery consisting of LiFePO4 cathode material with 20 Ah capacity was adopted to investigate the variation of the rate of heat generation as a function of the discharge capacity. Ten thermocouples and three heat flux sensors were applied to the battery surface at distributed locations. The results of this study show that the highest rate of heat generation was found to be 91 W for 4C discharge rate and 5 degrees C BC while the minimum value was 13 W measured at 1C discharge rate and 35 degrees C BC. It was also found that the increase in discharge rate and thus the discharge current caused consistent increase in the heat generation rate for equal depth of discharge points. A model is later developed using the neural network approach and validated. The heat generation rate predicted by the model demonstrates an identical behavior with experimental results.

AB This paper presents an investigation of the thermal performance of axial flow air cooling for lithium-ion battery pack. A thermal model for a battery pack with 32 single cells is developed and is numerically solved with coupling the fluid governing equations. The heat generation rate of the battery is calculated by a UDF (user defined function) program, which is based on a pseudo 2D model of the lithium-ion batteries. The effects of the radial interval between cells and air flux on the thermal performance of the axial flow air cooling system are investigated by numerical simulations. The results show that increasing the radial interval leads to a slight average temperature rise but benefits to the temperature uniformity of the battery pack. A larger radial interval can significantly reduce the power cost of the cooling system; however it causes a decrease of space efficiency mildly. A larger air flux is found to be benefit to the temperature uniformity within battery pack. An optimal region based on the assessment of the power cost, space efficiency and temperature homogeneity for the parameter designs of the battery cooling system is presented.

AB Phase change materials (PCM) cooling has been considered as the most potential alternative to traditional battery thermal management (BTM) technology, but significant challenges remain: PCM leakage, poor mechanical properties and low surface heat transfer capability between PCM and the external environment. Here, we develop a BTM technology based on the ternary composite materials of expanded graphite (EG), paraffin (PA) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) coupled with low fins. The as-doped LDPE framework can not only enhance the mechanical molding property but also prevent PA leakage to a great extent. Coupling with low fins endows the entire BTM system with high surface heat transfer capability. For instance, the as-prepared LDPE/EG/PA composite PCM shows much better mechanical properties and cooling effect in comparison to EG/PA composite and air cooling, respectively. After coupling with low fins, the as-constructed PCM-based battery module presents excellent heat dissipation performance, keeping the battery pack working under the safety temperature of 50 degrees C and temperature difference of 5 degrees C for lithium-ion power batteries, even at an extremely high discharge rate of 3.5 degrees C.

AB The thermal mechanics of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is explored with a focus on thermal swelling. Experiments show for the first time that the swelling shape of prismatic battery cells due to temperature variations is significantly different from that due to Li-ion intercalation in unconstrained conditions. In contrast to uniform and orthotropic Li-ion intercalation swelling in a direction perpendicular to electrodes, the nonuniform temperature distribution in the jellyroll and the gaps/voids between electrodes result in distinguishable different swelling shapes. A unique coupled thermal-structural analysis with a simple, but efficient 3-D finite numerical model is proposed to investigate the impact of temperature variations on the thermal behaviors of battery cells. Anisotropic heat conduction and temperature dependency of the coefficient of thermal expansion are taken into account and found to have an impact on temperature distribution and thermal expansion. Experimental validation of the proposed model clearly demonstrates that the coupled thermal-structural analysis with the proposed model can predict accurately the thermal swelling at unconstrained conditions. The solution at pack (constrained) conditions shows that the nonuniform temperature distribution of the jellyroll still plays a critical role for the thermal swelling shape, although the gaps/voids do not occur because of the constraints from spacers in the pack, suggesting that the estimation of core temperature is important. Such an accurate model, able to estimate cell thermal behavior, is beneficial to the design of Li-ion batteries, development of stress or strain sensors, optimum sensor placement, and thermal management of not only single battery cells but also battery packs.

AB A novel phenomenological multi-physics model of Lithium-ion battery cells is developed for control and state estimation purposes. The model can capture electrical, thermal, and mechanical behaviors of battery cells under constrained conditions, e.g., battery pack conditions. Specifically, the proposed model predicts the core and surface temperatures and reaction force induced from the volume change of battery cells because of electrochemically- and thermally-induced swelling. Moreover, the model incorporates the influences of changes in preload and ambient temperature on the force considering severe environmental conditions electrified vehicles face. Intensive experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed multi-physics model accurately predicts the surface temperature and reaction force for a wide operational range of preload and ambient temperature. This high fidelity model can be useful for more accurate and robust state of charge estimation considering the complex dynamic behaviors of the battery cell. Furthermore, the inherent simplicity of the mechanical measurements offers distinct advantages to improve the existing power and thermal management strategies for battery management.

AB A numerical study of the unsteady phase change convection-conduction heat transfer of an ion-lithium battery with volumetric heat generation used in solar vehicles is presented. The cooling process is investigated for a total of seven arrays of phase change material (PCM): capric acid (PCM 1), eicosane (PCM 2), decahydrated sodium carbonate (PCM 3) and octadecane (PCM 4) located in one or three layers around the battery. The results show that heat conduction predominates in the battery with a PCM and the liquid phase fraction of the PCM indicates that the melting initiates after 7 min, reaching totally liquid state after 14.25 min. From the different configurations of PCM around the battery, the configuration "B" (multiple PCM: PCM 1 (5 mm) + PCM 3 (2.9 mm) + PCM 2 (4.3 mm)) and the configuration with a single layer of PCM 3 (14.3 mm) respectively reduce the maximum temperature of the battery about 20.9 and 23.2 K compared with the temperature reached by the battery without PCM. This result occurs because of the Decahydrated Sodium Carbonate PCM, since it has the highest latent heat and has a low melting point. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Paraffin (RT44HC)/expanded graphite (EG) composite phase change material (CPCM) with enhanced thermal conductivity improves the thermal management of Li-ion batteries. The thermal management of these batteries may be further improved via optimizing the CPCM composition. In this study, the thermal management performance of CPCM, with different mass fractions of EG, is investigated for Li-ion batteries. CPCM samples were prepared by absorbing RT44HC into porous EG. The properties of composites, such as thermal conductivity and liquid phase change material (PCM) leakage, were measured. Our results show that: (1) EG incorporation dramatically enhances the thermal conductivity of CPCM and leads to a significant decrease in the temperature rise of Li-ion batteries; and (2) CPCM, with EG mass fractions varying from 9% to 20%, shows outstanding thermal management performance. Liquid PCM leakage, which decreases with an increase in EG loading, occurs during phase transition. We propose, taking into account liquid PCM leakage during phase transition, that CPCM with 16-20 wt.% EG can be viewed as the most promising alternative for Li-ion battery thermal management.

AB Cold weather is an important matter for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles (EV/HEVs), because the electro-chemical process is slowed at low temperatures, hence inducing a loss of power and energy. To prevent it from happening, battery packs are heated via a battery thermal management system (BTMS). However, in some cases, HEVs/EVs are not connected to the grid, so the BTMS uses energy from the battery pack, thus impacting total autonomy. Strategies exist, but must be optimized. Therefore, this paper proposes the design of a HEV strategy that is parked outside and unplugged from the electrical grid. Its objective is to find a compromise between the cost in energy contained in the battery and the aging of the cells. The optimization is based on dynamic programming and utilizes an electro-thermal battery model including aging. Simulation results are then compared with other strategies, underlining that parking outside at work or overnight without plugging in are issues with the actual strategies of common EVs/HEVs, mainly because aging as a result of cold temperatures is not considered.

AB A battery pack is produced by connecting the cells in series and/or in parallel to provide the necessary power for electric vehicles (EVs). Those parameters affecting cost and reliability of the EVs, including cycle life, capacity, durability and warranty are highly dependent on the thermal management system. In this work, computational fluid dynamic analysis is performed to investigate the air cooling system for a 38,120 cell battery pack. The battery pack contained 24 pieces of 38,120 cells, copper bus bars, intake and exhaust plenum and holding plates with venting holes. Heat generated by the cell during charging is measured using an accelerating rate calorimeter. Thermal performances of the battery pack were analyzed with various mass flow rates of cooling air using steady state simulation. The correlation between Nu number and Re number were deduced from the numerical modeling results and compared with literature. Additionally, an experimental testing of the battery pack at different charging rates is conducted to validate the correlation. This method provides a simple way to estimate thermal performance of the battery pack when the battery pack is large and full transient simulation is not viable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB One kind of composite board based battery thermal management system (BTMS) is proposed and a three-dimension battery thermal model is proposed in this work. The composite board consists of three parts with a sandwich structure, which contains a heat conducting shell, an insulation panel and phase change material (PCM). Then four different modes are compared in detail to verify the thermal performance of the composite board under normal operating condition and thermal abuse condition. The results show that the composite board can effectively improve the heat dissipation capability and the uniformity of the temperature, meanwhile it can enhance the heat-insulation capability of the battery pack to prevent the thermal runaway propagation. In addition, increasing the latent heat of PCM can greatly improve the thermal performance of the composite board, thus the PCM with a latent heat of 1125 kJ/kg and the phase change temperature between 303.15 K and 323.15 K are recommend to be used in the battery thermal management.

AB Heat pipe cooling for battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) in electric vehicles (EVs) is growing due to its advantages of high cooling efficiency, compact structure and flexible geometry. Considering the transient conduction, phase change and uncertain thermal conditions in a heat pipe, it is challenging to obtain the dynamic thermal characteristics accurately in such complex heat and mass transfer process. In this paper, a "segmented" thermal resistance model of a heat pipe is proposed based on thermal circuit method. The equivalent conductivities of different segments, viz. the evaporator and condenser of pipe, are used to determine their own thermal parameters and conditions integrated into the thermal model of battery for a complete three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The proposed "segmented" model shows more precise than the "non-segmented" model by the comparison of simulated and experimental temperature distribution and variation of an ultra-thin micro heat pipe (UMHP) battery pack, and has less calculation error to obtain dynamic thermal behavior for exact thermal design, management and control of heat pipe BTMSs. Using the "segmented" model, the cooling effect of the UMHP pack with different natural/forced convection and arrangements is predicted, and the results correspond well to the tests.

AB In the current energy scenario, system design and operation strategies are paramount especially for plants fed by renewable sources and/or whose production is strictly connected to the users demand. The systems optimization must consider the possibility of energy storage and of the conversion among different forms of energy. In this paper, a hybrid cogeneration system composed by a cogenerative internal combustion engine, a photovoltaic plant, a boiler and a pump as turbine is investigated. Different energy storage options are included: a pack of batteries, a water reservoir and a hot thermal storage.
   By applying the Particle Swarm Optimization method, the devices size and hourly operation are simultaneously optimized. The minimization of the overall cost is the optimization goal, while the main constraint is the fulfilment of the user request (electricity, heat and water). Results show that the cogenerative internal combustion engine supplies the 87% of the electricity and the 19% of the heat during winter time while, during summer period, it supplies the 89% of the electricity and the all heat. The use of a pump as turbine allows to reduce the battery discharge rate and the Depth of Discharge with a consequent increase of the battery lifetime. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since the evolution of the electric and hybrid vehicle, the analysis of batteries' characteristics and influence on driving range has become essential. This fact advocates the necessity of accurate simulation modeling for batteries. Different models for the Li-ion battery cell are reviewed in this paper and a group of the highly dynamic models is selected for comparison. A new open circuit voltage (OCV) model is proposed. The new model can simulate the OCV curves of lithium iron magnesium phosphate (LiFeMgPO4) battery type at different temperatures. It also considers both charging and discharging cases. The most remarkable features from different models, in addition to the proposed OCV model, are integrated in a single hybrid electrical model. A lumped thermal model is implemented to simulate the temperature development in the battery cell. The synthesized electro-thermal battery cell model is extended to model a battery pack of an actual electric vehicle. Experimental tests on the battery, as well as drive tests on the vehicle are performed. The proposed model demonstrates a higher modeling accuracy, for the battery pack voltage, than the constituent models under extreme maneuver drive tests.

AB In an electric vehicle (EV), thermal runaway, vibration or vehicle impact can lead to a potential failure of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs due to their high sensitivity to ambient temperature, pressure and dynamic mechanical loads. Amongst several factors, safety and reliability of battery packs present the highest challenges to large scale electrification of public and private transportation sectors. This paper reviews mechanical design features that can address these issues. More than 75 sources including scientific and technical literature and particularly 43 US Patents are studied. The study illustrates through examples that simple mechanical features can be integrated into battery packaging design to minimise the probability of failure and mitigate the aforementioned safety risks. Furthermore, the key components of a robust battery pack have been closely studied and the materials have been identified to design these components and to meet their functional requirements. Strategic battery pack placement technique is also discussed using an example of Nissan LEAF battery packaging design. Finally, the disclosed design solutions described in this paper are compared with the Chevrolet Volt battery pack design to reveal the basic mechanical design requirements for a robust and reliable battery packaging system.

AB Safety is the first priority in lithium ion (Li-ion) battery applications. A large portion of electrical and thermal hazards caused by Li-ion battery is associated with short circuit. In this paper, both external and internal short circuit tests are conducted. Li-ion batteries and battery packs of different capacities are used. The results indicate that external short circuit is worse for smaller size batteries due to their higher internal resistances, and this type of short can be well managed by assembling fuses. In internal short circuit tests, higher chance of failure is found on larger capacity batteries. A modified electrochemical-thermal model is proposed, which incorporates an additional heat source from nail site and proves to be successful in depicting temperature changes in batteries. Specifically, the model is able to estimate the occurrence and approximate start time of thermal runaway. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a hydrogel based thermal management system in suppressing thermal abuse and preventing thermal runaway propagation is verified through the external and internal short tests on batteries and battery packs.

AB Two Ultra-Thin Loop Heat Pipe (ULHP) prototypes with parallelogram and trapezoid evaporator configurations were developed for battery thermal management system (BTMS). The dissimilarities between their heat transfer characteristics including the critical work angles, the start-up features, the thermal resistances and the flow instability were all explored and compared with experiments conducted under multi-orientations. The specific influences of these two evaporator configurations on the stable operation of ULHP have been fully acknowledged. The experiments results demonstrated that both the two ULHP prototypes displayed good performances with limited assistance from the gravity, meeting the demand of working under multiple orientations. Specially, the parallelogram configuration showed superior performance in resisting gravity by better suppressing the flow instability, the ULHP could not only start up under 15 degrees inclination, but also the recession in heat transfer capability with placed angles was limited in 4%. Meanwhile, a reasonable mathematics model was established based on the steady operation state of ULHP, the predicted value fitted well with the experimental results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The battery electric vehicle is evolving and has the potential to replace conventional internal combustion-based vehicles in the future. Batteries are the major power source of these vehicles. A thermal management system is required for a battery to attain effective operation and long life in all environmental conditions. Although several types of thermal management system are available, there remains a need to address various issues like high power consumption, narrow optimum temperature range and operation in varying climates. Phase change materials can assist in resolving these issues. In this paper, battery thermal management systems for electric and hybrid electric vehicles are reviewed, and challenges and opportunities for battery electric vehicles are discussed. Cooling strategies used in various thermal management systems are explained. Applications of and issues regarding the use of phase change materials in thermal management systems are also reviewed. Potential bottlenecks that need to be addressed in electric vehicle technology are explained, as are important achievement milestones and trends regarding the growth of the electric vehicle industry. It is shown that using graphite can increase thermal conductivity of PCMs by up to 70 W m(-1)K(-1). Some commercially available passive thermal management systems for batteries use wax and graphite, which can increase the driving range of an electric scooter from 30 km to 55 km.

AB Environmental sustainability, more efficient use of energy, and active safety concepts are becoming important requirements for the actual elevation sector. In this context IK4-IKERLAN and ORONA have designed an auxiliary energy storage system (ESS) for a residential elevation application based on lithium-ion cells. Safety and specially lifetime are two of the main concerns surrounding this new technology, which is closely related to the cells operating behavior and temperature asymmetries in the complete ESS. Therefore, the temperature of the cells in battery packs (BPs) needs to be controlled in an efficient way. This paper describes the development of the thermal management system (TMS) designed for this application based on various Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) mathematical models. The accuracy of Transient model is validated by using a single module to compare the simulation temperature results with experimental measurements, with a maximum time-averaged temperature prediction error of 1.5 degrees C. The proposed design is validated as it fulfills the requirements for a wide operating window, with a maximum cell temperature of 39 degrees C and a thermal dispersion at system level below 3 degrees C for the worst tested case.

AB Lithium-ion ( Li-ion) batteries widely used in electric vehicles ( EVs) and hybrid EVs ( HEVs) are insufficient for vehicle use after they have degraded to 70% to 80% of their original capacity. Battery lifespan is a large consideration when designing battery packs for EVs/HEVs. Aging mechanisms, such as metal dissolution, growth of the passivated surface film layer on the electrodes, and loss of both recyclable lithium ions, affect the longevity of the Li-ion battery at high-temperature operations. Even vehicle maneuvers at low temperatures ( T < 0 degrees C) contribute to battery lifetime degradation, owing to the anode electrode vulnerability to other degradation mechanisms such as lithium plating. Nowadays, only a few battery thermal management schemes have properly considered low-temperature degradation. This is due to the lack of studies on aging of Li-ion batteries at subzero temperature. This paper investigates how load cycle and calendar life properties affect the lifetime and aging processes of Li-ion cells at low temperatures. Accelerated aging tests were used to determine the effect of the ambient temperature on the performance of three 100-Ah LiFeMnP0(4) Li-ion cells. Two of them were aged through a normalized driving cycle at two temperature tests (-20 degrees C and 25 degrees C). The calendar test was carried out on one single battery at -20 degrees C and mid-range of state of charge ( 50%). Their capacities were continuously measured every two or three days. An aging model is developed and added to a preliminary single-cell electrothermal model to establish, in future works, a thermal strategy capable of predicting how the cell ages. This aging model was then validated by comparing its predictions with the aging data obtained from a cycling test at 0 degrees C.

AB Thermal management especially cooling of electric vehicles (EVs) battery pack is of great significance for guaranteeing the performance of the cells as well as safety and high-efficiency working of the EVs. Liquid cooling is a powerful way to keep the battery temperature in a proper range. However, the efficiency of conventional liquid cooling is still limited due to the inherently low thermal conductivity of the coolant which is usually water or aqueous ethanol. In this paper, a new kind of coolant, liquid metal, is proposed to be used for the thermal management of the battery pack. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the cooling capability, pump power consumption and module temperature uniformity of the liquid metal cooling system, in comparison with that of water cooling. The results show that under the same flow conditions, a lower and more uniform module temperature can be obtained and less pump power consumption are needed in the liquid metal cooling system. In addition, liquid metal has an excellent cooling capability coping with stressful conditions, such as high power draw, defects in cells, and high ambient temperature. This makes it a promising coolant for the thermal management of high driving force EVs and quick charge batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium-ion batteries are widely used for battery electric (all-electric) vehicles (BEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) due to their high energy and power density. An battery thermal management system (BTMS) is crucial for the performance, lifetime, and safety of lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, a novel design of BTMS based on aluminum minichannel tubes is developed and applied on a single prismatic Li-ion cell under different discharge rates. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the BTMS using different flow rates and configurations. With minichannel cooling, the maximum cell temperature at a discharge rate of 1C is less than 27.8 degrees C, and the temperature difference across the cell is less than 0.80 degrees C using flow rate at 0.20 L/min, at the expense of 8.69e-6 W pumping power. At higher discharge rates, e.g., 1.5C and 2C, higher flow rates are required to maintain the same temperature rise and temperature difference. The flow rate needed is 0.8 L/min for 1.5C and 2.0 L/min for 2C, while the required pumping power is 4.23e-4 W and 5.27e-3 W, respectively. The uniform temperature distribution (<1 degrees C) inside the single cell and efficient pumping power demonstrate that the minichannel cooling system provides a promising solution for the BTMS.

AB Thermal management is critical for safe and reliable operation of lithium-ion battery systems. In this study, a one-dimensional thermal-electrochemical model of lithium-ion battery interactively coupled with a two-dimensional thermal-fluid conjugate model for forced convection air cooling of a lithium-ion battery module is presented and solved numerically. This coupled approach makes the model more unique and detailed as transport inside each cell in the battery module is solved for and thus covering multiple length and time scales. The effect of certain design and operating parameters of the thermal management system on the performance of the battery module is assessed using the coupled model. It is found that a lower temperature increase of the battery module can be achieved by either increasing the inlet air velocity or decreasing the distance between the cells. Higher air inlet velocity, staggered cell arrangement or a periodic reversal airflow of high reversal frequency results in a more uniform temperature distribution in the module. However, doing so increases the parasitic load as well as the volume of the battery module whence a trade-off should be taken into account between these parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Thermal management is critical to improving battery performance and suppressing thermal runaway. Besides developing external cooling technologies, it is important to understand and control thermal transport inside batteries. In this paper, heat transfer inside batteries is first analyzed and the thermal conductivity of each component is measured. The results show that low thermal conductivity of the separator is one major barrier for heat transfer in Li-ion batteries. To improve thermal conductivity of the separator, a hierarchical nano/micro-Al2O3/polymer separator is prepared with thermal conductivity of similar to 1 W m(-1) K-1, representing an enhancement of 5 x compared to commercial polyethylene-based separators. Modeling has been performed to understand mechanism behind the enhancement of thermal conductivity, which suggests that addition of nanoparticles significantly reduces thickness of polymer coating on micron-sized Al2O3 particles and thus increase the thermal conductivity of the composite separator. This Al2O3-based separator also has similar ionic conductivity with commercial polymer separators. Such composite separator may have potential applications in developing batteries with better performance and safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three phenomenological force and swelling models are developed to predict mechanical phenomena caused by Li-ion intercalation: a 1-D force model, a 1st order relaxation model, and a 3-D swelling model. The 1-D force model can estimate the Li-ion intercalation induced force for actual pack conditions with preloads. The model incorporates a nonlinear elastic stiffness to capture the mechanical consequences of Li-ion intercalation swelling. The model also separates the entire state of charge range into three regions considering phase transitions. The 1st order relaxation model predicts dynamic swelling during relaxation periods. A coefficient of relaxation is estimated from dynamic and quasi-static swelling at operational conditions. The 3-D swelling model predicts the swelling shape on the battery surface for all states of charge. This model introduces an equivalent modulus of elasticity, which is dependent on the state of charge, to capture material transformations of the electrodes, and the orthotropic expansion of the jellyroll in a direction perpendicular to the electrode surfaces. Considering the simplicity of the measurements and direct physical correlations between stress and strain, the proposed models can enhance battery management systems and power management strategies.

AB Since lithium-ion battery with high energy density is the key component for next-generation electrical vehicles, a full understanding of its thermal behaviors at different discharge rates is quite important for the design and thermal management of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) pack/module. In this work, a 25 Ah pouch type Li[Ni0.7Co0.15Mn0.15] O-2/graphite LIBs with specific energy of 200 Wh.kg(-1) were designed to investigate their thermal behaviors, including temperature distribution, heat generation rate, heat capacity and heat transfer coefficient with environment. Results show that the temperature increment of the charged pouch batteries strongly depends on the discharge rate and depth of discharge. The heat generation rate is mainly influenced by the irreversible heat effect, while the reversible heat is important at all discharge rates and contributes much to the middle evolution of the temperature during discharge, especially at low rate. Subsequently, a prediction model with lumped parameters was used to estimate the temperature evolution at different discharge rates of LIBs. The predicted results match well with the experimental results at all discharge rates. Therefore, the thermal model is suitable to predict the average temperature for the large-scale batteries under normal operating conditions.

AB A novel concept named as state of balance (SOB) is proposed and its online dynamic estimation method is presented for the high-power lithium-ion battery (LIB) packs, based on which the online dynamic equalization adjustment is realized aiming to protect the operation safety of its power supply application. The core parameter detection method based on the specific moving average algorithm is studied because of their identical varying characteristics on the individual cells due to the manufacturing variability and other factors, affecting the performance of the high-power LIB pack. The SOB estimation method is realized with the detailed deduction, in which a dual filter consisting of the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF), equivalent circuit model (ECM) and open circuit voltage (OCV) is used in order to predict the SOB state. It is beneficial for the energy operation and the energy performance state can be evaluated online prior to the adjustment method based on the terminal voltage consistency. The energy equalization is realized that is based on the credibility reasoning together with the equalization model building process. The experiments including the core parameter detection, SOB estimation and equalization adjustment are done and the experimental results are analyzed. The experiment results show that the numerical Coulomb efficiency is bigger than 95%. The cell voltage measurement error is less than 5 mV and the terminal voltage measurement error of the LIB pack is less than 1% FS. The measurement error of the battery discharge and charge maintenance current is less than 1% FS. The SOB estimation error is less than 5% in the laboratory room, the temperature of which is about 25 degrees C. The equalization charging current is 2 A and the equalization discharging current is 4.4 A, which can realize the real-time energy equalization adjustment among the connected cells in the LIB pack, guaranteeing its safety in the power supply application.

AB Due to the temperature sensitive behavior of lithium-ion batteries a thermal management system (TMS) is typically integrated into the battery pack design. This system plays a crucial role in the total battery pack performance. During operation the TMS will induce nonuniform temperature distributions within the cells of the pack, due to relatively low cell thermal conductivity. However, limited research has been published regarding the effects of thermal nonuniformity throughout a cell, module, or pack. Understanding these effects will be beneficial to heat exchanger design and TMS control strategy optimization. Here, an experimental investigation is performed where fixed one-dimensional temperature distributions, emulating the effects of edge-based heat transfer, are applied across the face of a 10Ah NiCoMn Li-ion pouch cell. Average cell temperature conditions of 15, 25, and 35 degrees C with edge-to-edge temperature differences (Delta T) of 0, 5, 10, and 20 degrees C are applied. At each thermal treatment the effects on: (1) the pulse resistance at 50% state of charge, (2) the bulk resistance on a Charge-Depleting US06 power, profile, and (3) the overpotential during Constant-Current charge are investigated. Pulse resistance is decreased with increased Delta T. However, the discharge resistance on the Charge-Depleting cycle was increased with increased Delta T. The Constant-Current charging overpotential (and therefore resistance) was also increased with increased Delta T. All effects are largest at 15 degrees C, and negligible at 35 degrees C.

AB Supercapacitors benefit from unique features including high power density, long cycle life, wide temperature operation range, durability in harsh environments, efficient cycling, and low maintenance cost. This paper presents a validated lumped and computationally efficient electrical and thermal model for a cylindrical supercapacitor cell. The electrical model is a two-state equivalent electric circuit model with three parameters that are identified using temporal experiments. The dependence of the parameters on the state of charge, current direction and magnitude (20-200 A), and temperatures ranging from -40 degrees C to 60 degrees C is incorporated in the model. The thermal model is a linear 1-D model with two states. The reversible heat generation which is significant in double-layer capacitors is included in the thermal model. The coupling of the two models enables tuning of the temperature-dependent parameters of the electrical model in real time. The coupled electrothermal model is validated using real-world duty cycles at subzero and room temperatures with root-mean-square errors of (82 mV-87 mV) and (0.17 degrees C-0.21 degrees C) for terminal voltage and temperature, respectively. This accurate model is implementable in real-time power applications and also thermal management studies of supercapacitor packs.

AB This paper presents a experimentally-validated fractal time thermal model to describe the discharge and cooling down processes of air-cooled cylindrical Lithium-ion cells. Three cases were studied, a spatially isolated single cell under natural convection and two spatial configurations of modules with forced air cooling: staggered and aligned arrays with 30 and 25 cells respectively. Surface temperature measurements for discharge processes were obtained in a single cell at 1 C, 2 C and 3 C discharge rates, and in the two arrays at 1 C discharge rate. In the modules, surface temperature measurements were obtained for selected cells at specific inlet cooling air speeds. The fractal time energy equation captures the anomalous temperature relaxation and describes the cell surface temperature using a stretched exponential model. Stretched exponential temperature models of cell surface temperature show a better agreement with experimental measurements than pure exponential temperature models. Cells closer to the horizontal side walls have a better heat dissipation than the cells along the centerline of the module. The high prediction capabilities of the fractal time energy equation are useful in new design approaches of thermal control strategies of modules and packs, and to develop more efficient signal-correction algorithms in multipoint temperature measurement technologies in Li-ion batteries.

AB This paper presents an investigation on the unbalanced discharging and aging due to temperature difference between the parallel-connected cells. A thermal electrochemical model is developed for the parallel-connected battery pack. The effects of temperature difference on the unbalanced discharging performances are studied by simulations and experiments. For the parallel-connected cells, the cell at higher temperature experiences a larger current in the early discharging process before approximately 75% of depth of discharge (DOD). When the discharge process approaches the voltage turn point of the battery pack, the discharge current through the cell at higher temperature begins to decrease significantly. After the DOD reaches approximately 90%, the discharge current of the cell at higher temperature rises again. Correspondingly, the changes in the discharging current through the cell at lower temperature are opposite to that of the cell at higher temperature. Simulations also show that the temperature difference between the parallel-connected cells greatly aggravates the imbalance discharge phenomenon between the cells, which accelerates the losses of the battery pack capacity. For the parallel-connected battery pack, the capacity loss rate approximately increases linearly as the temperature difference between the cells increases. This trend is magnified with the increase of operating temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to extend the cycle life of power battery pack within electric vehicle, a phase change material (PCM)/mini-channel coupled power battery thermal management (BTM) system, as well as the three-dimensional battery thermal model, was designed in this paper. The effect of various influencing factors, especially mass flow rate of water, phase change temperature and thermal conductivity of PCM, were investigated numerically. The results showed that the liquid volume fraction of PCM was greatly influenced by the thermal conductivity and the phase change temperature of PCM. The increasing number of channels results in a decrease of the maximum temperature (T-Max) and maximum temperature difference (AT) of battery packs. The optimal phase change temperature and thermal conductivity of PCM were 308.15 K and 0.6 W m(-1) K-1 respectively when the number of channel was eight and the mass flow rate was 8 x 10(-4) kg s(-1). Moreover, a maximum temperature of 320.6 K was predicted for the PCM/mini-channel coupled BTM system, while a maximum temperature of 335.4 K was predicted for the PCM-based BTM system. Additionally, the PCM/mini-channel coupled BTM system presented more effective thermal performance and the research will be a clear indicator for the design of the PCM/liquid coupled BTM system.

AB Choosing a proper cooling method for a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery pack for electric drive vehicles (EDVs) and making an optimal cooling control strategy to keep the temperature at a optimal range of 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C is essential to increasing safety, extending the pack service life, and reducing costs. When choosing a cooling method and developing strategies, trade-offs need to be made among many facets such as costs, complexity, weight, cooling effects, temperature uniformity, and parasitic power. This paper considers four cell-cooling methods: air cooling, direct liquid cooling, indirect liquid cooling, and fin cooling. To evaluate their effectiveness, these methods are assessed using a typical large capacity Li-ion pouch cell designed for EDVs from the perspective of coolant parasitic power consumption, maximum temperature rise, temperature difference in a cell, and additional weight used for the cooling system. We use a state-of-the-art Li-ion battery electro-chemical thermal model. The results show that under our assumption an air-cooling system needs 2 to 3 more energy than other methods to keep the same average temperature; an indirect liquid cooling system has the lowest maximum temperature rise; and a fin cooling system adds about 40% extra weight of cell, which weighs most, when the four kinds cooling methods have the same volume. Indirect liquid cooling is a more practical form than direct liquid cooling though it has slightly lower cooling performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Safety mechanism is required for an automotive battery pack to prevent thermal failure which could lead to catastrophic events. Passively cooled battery packs can prevent thermal failure by conducting adaptive control of battery power without any external cooling device. The key to this power control is how to secure battery safety while minimizing energy loss. This paper proposes a novel, adaptive power control strategy for automotive passive-cooling battery packs. Four different cases with electrochemical battery model are simulated and compared to each other according to a city driving profile. Driving simulation result confirmed that the present power control algorithm is an effective solution for preventing thermal failure along with improving energy efficiency of automotive battery packs.

AB High latent heat of PCMs (phase change materials) has made them as one of the most important materials for thermal management purposes. However, PCMs' low thermal diffusivities could limit their use in applications which require fast thermal response. The goal of this study is to simulate thermal performance of a lithium ion battery cell in the presence of carbon fiber-PCM composites. The effect of carbon fiber loading within the PCM on thermal performance is studied and the results are compared with the experimental data. The results showed that the presence of carbon fibers increases the effective thermal conductivity of PCM and hence influences temperature distribution within the cell. PCM composites containing higher percentages of carbon fibers present a more uniform temperature distribution. The results showed that the minimum and maximum thermal conductivity enhancement of 85% and 155% respectively (105% on average). A reasonable agreement is obtained between the simulation results and the experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The critical challenges to enlarge the market share of electric vehicles (EVs) are cost, performance, reliability and safety. These issues are closely linked to the energy storage system in the EVs. Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized the EV industry to become the preferred battery choice for EVs. This is due to their outstanding characteristics including high energy density, high voltage, low self-discharge rate, long cycle life, high charging and discharging rate capability. In EVs, Lithium-ion cells are connected in series and/or parallel, to deliver the required power to the traction motor and auxiliary systems. However, due to the operating environment of EVs, the Lithium-ion battery may not perform to the best of its ability when integrated into an EV battery pack. In this work, the integration of Lithium-ion battery into an EV battery pack is investigated from different aspects, namely different battery chemistry, cell packaging, electric connection and control, thermal management, assembly and service and maintenance. In addition, benchmarking study using different cell packaging of Lithium Iron Phosphate cell as an energy storage system is conducted. This study provides a basic guideline for cell selection and integration of cell for the EVs battery pack. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The lithium-ion battery pack in hybrid electric vehicles is an important energy storage device that requires proper thermal management. A considerable amount of heat is generated by the battery cells owing to their internal resistance during charging and discharging, especially for peak vehicle loads. This study focuses on developing a smart controlled thermal management solution in which a vapor compression system is integrated. A lumped-parameter cylindrical battery thermal model is developed with a Kalman observer to estimate the transient changes in the temperatures of the battery surface, the battery core, and the cooling air flowing around the cells. For the first time, the optimal cooling air temperature of the battery is investigated using optimal control theory. A model predictive controller is then introduced to regulate the refrigerant compressor and to track the ideal cooling air temperature. In a case study, the power consumption of the thermal management system and the behavior of the internal temperature of the battery are investigated under an urban assault cycle. For various operation configurations and conditions, the numerical results demonstrate that the peak error of the core temperature of the battery can be tracked within 0.25 degrees C of the target value and the energy consumption of the cooling system can be reduced by up to 58%.

AB Based on the coupled model of a three-dimensional thermal model and one-dimensional electrochemical model, the thermal behaviors of lithium-titanate battery under the discharge-charge cycling with various current are investigated. The temperature on the surface of battery increases with the increasing cycling rate. Two temperature peaks are observed during the constant-current discharge, constant-current and constant-voltage charge process based on the analysis of the heat generation. Additionally, the radiative heat transfer cannot be omitted when the battery is operated under natural convection at 0.5 C cycling rate, in this case, the radiative heat transfer is estimated to contribute 42% to the total heat transfer. The results can provide basic data for the thermal management of the battery pack during the discharging and charging processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The thermal swelling of rechargeable lithium-ion battery cells is investigated as a function of the charge state and the charge/discharge rate. The thermal swelling shows significant dependency on the state of charge and the charge rate. The thermal swelling follows a quadratic form at low temperatures, and shows linear characteristics with respect to temperature at high temperatures in free-swelling conditions. Moreover, the equivalent coefficient of thermal expansion is much larger than that of each electrode and host materials, suggesting that the separator and the complex shape of the cell play a critical role in thermal expansion. Based on the experimental characterization, a novel thermal swelling model is proposed. The model introduces an equivalent coefficient of thermal expansion for the cell and also considers the temperature distribution throughout the battery by using heat transfer theory. The comparison between the proposed model and experiments demonstrates that the model accurately predicts thermal swelling at a variety of charge/discharge rates during operation and relaxation periods. The model is relatively simple yet very accurate. Hence, it can be useful for battery management applied to prolong the cycle life of cells and packs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Li-ion batteries have been widely used in the EVs, and the battery thermal management is a key but challenging part of the battery management system. For EV batteries, only the battery surface temperature can be measured in real-time. However, it is the battery internal temperature that directly affects the battery performance, and large temperature difference may exist between surface and internal temperatures, especially in high power demand applications. In this paper, an online battery internal temperature estimation method is proposed based on a novel simplified thermoelectric model. The battery thermal behaviour is first described by a simplified thermal model, and battery electrical behaviour by an electric model. Then, these two models are interrelated to capture the interactions between battery thermal and electrical behaviours, thus offer a comprehensive description of the battery behaviour that is useful for battery management. Finally, based on the developed model, the battery internal temperature is estimated using an,extended Kalman filter. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, and it can be used for online internal temperature estimation which is a key indicator for better real-time battery thermal management.

AB This paper proposes a simple constrained proportional controller with gain scheduling for simultaneous thermal and state-of-charge (SOC) balancing of a multilevel converter based modular battery. The proposed balancing controller is devised by investigating structural properties of constrained linear quadratic (LQ) model predictive controller (MPC) introduced in our earlier study. This investigation reveals a particular factorization of time-varying control gain matrices, which leads to approximation of matrix gains as scalar gains under the assumption of small parametric variations among battery cells. The gains are scheduled in load current for nominal cells. This special structure enables the identification of two dominant operational modes of the balancing controller: SOC balancing mode in low to medium load current range and thermal balancing mode in high current range. This study also proposes a simple algorithm for control projection on constraint polytope. The proposed balancing controller is tested in simulations for a modular battery with four significantly mismatched cells. The performance is comparable to MPC, which uses true battery parameters. The performance and the simplicity of the controller make it attractive for real-time implementation in large battery packs.
