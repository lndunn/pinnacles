AB In this paper, we present theoretical and numerical modeling results for thermal analysis of Lithium ion (LiFePO4) battery cells during discharge (0.2C, 0.5C, 1C). Thermal management is important for many reasons, including thermal runaway, performance and maintains a constant temperature during the operating, security, lifecycle. However, in a battery pack, the batteries are stacked against each other without cooling surfaces except the outer surface of the package and the cell in the center of pack are exposed to overheating and thermal runaway. A modeling for a single LiFePO4 battery cell is presented together with preliminary experiments in ambient temperature (20 degrees C similar to 35 degrees C) and the results for determination of heating sources during discharging. A favorable agreement between experiments and the model is found and it will be necessary for further work.

AB In a scenario of a small and customized production of Electric Vehicles, it is important to have methodologies and tools able to guarantee high flexibility, good quality, and reduced time to market. The optimisation of electric motors and battery design stages is a key factor to achieve the expected results. Specific activities such as design automation, virtual prototyping and simulation are fundamental to obtain high-performance customised solutions. In this context the study of cooling systems for Li-Ion battery packs is one of the most important problems regarding EV and PHEV powertrain design.
   The proposed research presents a Knowledge Based methodology to support the cooling design of a battery pack and an analytical tool to evaluate the temperature and heat generation due to electrochemical reactions. All the research project is finalized to a definition of a Knowledge Based System to define a battery layout including engineering knowledge. The current strategies of battery pack design depend on the market size. In particular, the research activity is focalized on customized production of a SME (Small Medium Enterprise).
   The main question concerns the estimation of heat generated from electrochemical reactions in a single battery cell. In order to achieve these objectives, a preliminary phase for knowledge acquisition is necessary and a process of formalization has been carried out using the Knowledge Management methods. A first prototype of the Knowledge Based Engineering tool has been developed to determine the optimal cooling condition of a battery pack. The main module is based on an analytical approach which has been formulated to evaluate the average thermal flow generated by a standard LiFePO4 polymeric cell at different values of current and state of charge (SOC). This method can be used for different types of geometry and different chemical compositions. Finally, the proposed approach has been validated by experimental measures and numerical simulations in collaboration with a medium enterprise of electric energy storage systems and light ecological vehicles.

AB A lithium-ion battery module can comprise a large number of cells, which contain further functional layers and groups. Detailed, mechanistic mathematical modeling of the physicochemical phenomena that occur at different length scales throughout a battery module is therefore a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a method to reduce the computational cost when solving a Li-ion battery model comprising transient equations of change - species, charge, and energy - through model reformulation and a procedure to automate the task of drawing the battery module and solving it numerically. Reformulation is carried out for the model validated with experimental results. The automation not only reduces the overall time to find a numerical solution, but it also removes the chance of human errors during the pre-processing step. The procedure is verified with significant gains in computational cost: the reformulated model is around 40% faster than without the reformulation, and the model for a 50-cell battery module takes only around 14 s to set up numerically. The reformulated mathematical model in combination with automated model generation thus opens up avenues for wide-ranging parameter studies, automated multiobjective optimization of design, layout, management strategies and operating conditions of a battery module.

AB Lithium-titanate batteries have become an attractive option for battery electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. In order to maintain safe operating temperatures, these batteries must be actively cooled during operation. Liquid-cooled systems typically employed for this purpose are inefficient due to the parasitic power consumed by the on-board chiller unit and the coolant pump. A more efficient option would be to circulate ambient air through the battery bank and directly reject the heat to the ambient. We designed and fabricated such an air-cooled thermal management system employing metal-foam based heat exchanger plates for sufficient heat removal capacity. Experiments were conducted with Altairnano's 50 Ah cells over a range of charge-discharge cycle currents at two air flow rates. It was found that an airflow of 1100 mls(-1) per cell restricts the temperature rise of the coolant air to less than 10 degrees C over ambient even for 200 A charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, it was shown that the power required to drive the air through the heat exchanger was less than a conventional liquid-cooled thermal management system. The results indicate that air-cooled systems can be an effective and efficient method for the thermal management of automotive battery packs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To improve the cycle life of battery pack or module within electric vehicle, a two-dimensional liquid water single-phase convective heat transfer model for cooling power battery was formulated in this study. The thermal behavior and flow characteristic were investigated. The results showed that the maximum temperature was lower than 49.59 degrees C when the heat generation rate is less than 3.75 x 10(5) w.m(-3). The maximum velocity is 7.18 x 10(-3) m.s(-1) under 3.75 x 10(5) w.m(-3) heat generation rate with the thermal conductivity of 0.6 W.m(-1).K-1. The vectors of velocity showed a distinct flow performance and confirmed the possibility of the model for power battery cooling. With well designed, the liquid single-phase cooling system can be used for some specific power batteries heat dissipation.

AB This paper examines a TMS (thermal management system) of a range-extended EV (electric vehicle), which operates on its battery before the gasoline engine engages. In this period of independence of the ICE (internal combustion engine), the vehicle performance characteristics such as range, power for acceleration, fuel economy and emissions depend solely on the battery performance. Since the magnitude and uniformity of temperature in battery packs has significant impact on their performance, it is imperative to keep the battery temperature within optimal performance levels through a capable TMS that can efficiently transfer heat within the vehicle. The objective of this paper is to analyze the refrigerant and coolant circuits in the vehicle for cooling during high ambient temperatures and determine the irreversibilities and areas for improvement within these circuits. A second law analysis is used to examine the areas of low exergy efficiency in the system and minimize the entropy generation. Based on the analysis, the energetic COP (coefficient of performance) ranges of 1.8-2.4 and exergetic COP ranges of 0.26-0.39 are calculated for the system. Various parametric studies have been conducted and the most significant impact on the overall exergetic COP is found to be the ambient temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A hybrid power composed of fuel cell and batteries has become the good strategy for HEV. On the contrary, the produced heat of batteries can affect to the total performance of HEV significantly. In this study, simulation methods with optimization were developed for obtaining the high performance cooling system of batteries. At first, a numerical method for obtaining the temperature distribution of batteries was developed by using CFD. In the following step, several parameters were investigated for selecting design variables with the important effect on the performance of the cooling system of batteries. Finally, an optimization method based on DOE and RSM was obtained through a real optimal design. There was 21.1% reduction on the view of the root mean square temperature between batteries as shown in the optimization result. The developed analysis with optimization can be used to improve the performance of the cooling system of batteries, and these works have made the theoretical basis for simulation and optimization of the cooling system of batteries.

AB Systems integration issues, such as electrical and thermal design and management of full battery packs - often containing hundreds of cells - have been rarely explored in the academic literature. In this paper we discuss the design and construction of a 9 kWh battery pack for a motorsports application. The pack contained 504 lithium cells arranged into 2 sidepods, each containing 3 modules, with each module in a 12P7S configuration. This paper focuses particularly on testing the full battery pack and diagnosing subsequent problems related to cells being connected in parallel. We demonstrate how a full vehicle test can be used to identify malfunctioning strings of cells for further investigation. After individual cell testing it was concluded that a single high inter-cell contact resistance was causing currents to flow unevenly within the pack, leading to cells being unequally worked. This is supported by a Matlab/Simulink model of one battery module, including contact resistances. Over time the unequal current flowing through cells can lead to significant differences in cells' state of charge and open circuit voltages, large currents flowing between cells even when the load is disconnected, cells discharging and aging more quickly than others, and jeopardise capacity and lifetime of the pack.

AB Safe and reliable operation of a Li-ion battery requires control and often management of the thermal envelope. In this context, a two-dimensional, transient mathematical model comprising conservation of charges, species, and energy together with electroneutrality, constitutive relations and relevant initial and boundary conditions for a spiral-wound cylindrical Li-ion battery is derived and solved numerically for passive thermal management with and without a phase change material (PCM) at various galvanostatic discharge rates. Two-way coupling of the electrochemical and thermal equations of change is attained through heat generation terms and temperature-dependent physical properties. Within this framework, the electrochemical and thermal behavior is discussed in terms of edge effects arising from the design of the spiral-wound structure and variations in heat generation in the functional layers. In addition, the cell performance with passive thermal management through a PCM is shown to lower the overall temperature of the cell at discharge rates around 5 C-rates, provided the PCM layer is thick enough to provide cooling during the entire discharge. The model can be employed for wide-ranging parameter studies as well as multi-objective optimization of not only design parameters pertaining to the spirals but also, for example, for design of the thickness of the PCM layer.

AB In order to better understand the heat dissipation performance of power battery for electrical vehicles, a three-dimensional model based on phase change material (PCM) cooling for individual cylindrical battery cell has been developed. The model takes into account the effects of unsteady heat generation, internal conduction and external natural convection to investigate the temperature response and distribution. The simulation results showed that the PCM with thermal conductivity higher than 0.8 W m(-1) K-1 can be used for keeping the maximum temperature below 50 degrees C in a battery cell under a constant heat generation rate of 170 000 W m(-3). The unsteady discharge simulated results demonstrated that the heat transfer coefficient was another important factor for heat transfer enhancement. The PCM based power battery thermal management system indicated effective cycle application because the PCM can store most of the thermal energy during discharge and release it to the outer air during charge or non-start state.

AB The analysis and optimization of thermal performance of Li-ion battery packs are topics of great interest today. Most Dion batteries for motive, vehicular, backup power and utility energy storage applications are fitted with a microprocessor-controlled thermal management system including an array of temperature and voltage sensors and an active cooling system. However, as the complexity of the thermal management system increases, so does its weight, volume and parasitic power consumption, all factors that adversely affect the vehicle's' performance. In this sense, an improved thermal management system based on including passive solutions such as phase change materials or heat spreading technologies could decrease the load on active components and ultimately the weight and costs of the system.
   This paper describes an experimental and simulation study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of flexible graphite materials for heat spreaders in battery thermal management systems. A commercial Li-ion battery pack for power tools applications was adopted as a case study The electro-thermal behavior of the battery pack was characterized through combined experimental investigation and 3D FEM modeling to determine the heat generation rate of the battery cells during utilization and to evaluate the thermal behavior of the battery pack A thermal management solution based on flexible graphite heat spreading material was then designed and implemented The paper presents a comparative study conducted in simulation to evaluate the improvements in the pack thermal behavior.

AB A battery pack prototype has been designed and built to evaluate various air cooling concepts for the thermal management of Li-ion batteries. The heat generation from the Li-Ion batteries was simulated with electrical heat generation devices, with the same dimensions as the Li-Ion battery (200mm x 150mm x 12mm). Each battery imitator generates up to 15W of heat. There are 20 temperature probes placed uniformly on the surface of the battery imitator, which can measure temperatures in the range from - 40 degrees C to +120 degrees C. The experimental chamber has 2 battery imitators. All temperatures are recorded using a PC based DAQ system. We can measure the average surface temperature of the imitator, temperature distribution on each surface and temperature distributions of the chamber. The pack which holds the battery imitators is built as a crate, with adjustable gap (varies from 2mm to 5mm) between the imitators for air flow channel studies. The total system flow rate and the inlet flow temperature are controlled during the test. The cooling channel with various heat transfer enhancing devices can be installed between the imitators to investigate the cooling performance. The pack is thermally isolated, which prevents heat transfer from it to the surroundings. The flow device can provide the air flow rate in the gap of up to 5m/s velocity and air temperature in the range from -30 degrees C to +50 degrees C. Test results are compared with computational modeling of the test configurations. The present test set up will be used for future tests to develop and validate new cooling concepts, such as surface conditions or heat pipes.

AB Battery thermal management for high power applications such as electrical vehicle (EV) or hybrid electrical vehicle (REV) is crucial. Modeling is an indispensable tool to help engineers design better battery cooling systems. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used quite successfully for battery thermal management, CFD models can be too large and too slow for repeated transient thermal analysis, especially for a battery module or pack. A state space model based on CFD results can be used to replace the original CFD model. The state space model runs approximately two orders of magnitude faster and yet under some conditions obtains equivalent results as the original CFD model. The state space model is based on linear and time-invariant (LTI) system theory. The main limitation of the method is that the method applies strictly speaking to systems that satisfy both linearity and time invariance conditions. General battery cooling problems unfortunately do not strictly satisfy those two conditions. This paper examines quantitatively the amount of error involved if these two conditions are not met. It turns out that these conditions can be relaxed in some ways while preserving satisfactory results for non-linear and time-varying battery thermal systems. This paper also discusses non-linear curve fitting needed for the method.

AB Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are favored in hybrid-electric vehicles and electric vehicles for their outstanding power characteristics. In this paper the energy loss due to electrical contact resistance (ECR) at the interface of electrodes and current-collector bars in Li-ion battery assemblies is investigated for the first time. ECR is a direct result of contact surface imperfections and acts as an ohmic resistance at the electrode-collector joints. ECR is measured at electrode connections of a sample Li-ion battery, and a straightforward analysis is presented to evaluate the relevant energy loss. Through the experiments, it is observed that ECR is an important issue in energy management of Li-ion batteries. Effects of surface imperfection, contact pressure, joint type, collector bar material, and interfacial materials on ECR are highlighted. The obtained data show that in the considered battery, the energy loss due to ECR can be as high as 20% of the total energy flow in and out of the battery under normal operating conditions. However, ECR loss can be reduced to 6% when proper joint pressure and/or surface treatment are used. A poor connection at the electrode-collector interface can lead to a significant battery energy loss as heat generated at the interface. At sever conditions, heat generation due to ECR might cause serious safety issues, thermal runaway, sparks, and even melting of the electrodes.

AB Due to increasing oil demand and serious global warming, a green power generation system is urgently requested in transportation. Electric/hybrid vehicles (EV/HEV) have been considered as a potential solution with great promise in achieving high energy/power efficiency and a low environmental impact. The important electric and electronic equipment in EV/HEV are the battery, inverter and motor. However, because of the high power density in the inverters or the low working temperature of batteries, the cooling problems affect significantly the working performance or the lifetime of electric and electronic equipment in EV/HEV. This paper views different cooling systems including the battery cooling system, inverter cooling system and motor cooling system. A general introduction to the EV/HEV and the electric and electronic equipment working processes are briefly presented at first. Then different methods for the battery cooling system, the inverter cooling system and the motor cooling system are outlined and discussed in this paper. Among other things, the means of using phase change material, or electro-thermal modules are significant for the battery cooling system. Finally, some conclusions or recommendations are presented for the cooling systems, in order to promote the EV/HEV development.

AB The temperature of lithium-ion batteries in EVs must be maintained in a proper range for safety using and optimum performance. To solve the thermal problem of LiFePO4 battery, a passive thermal management system with phase change material (PCM) is discussed. D. C. resistance of the cell is measured by voltammetry method based on HPPC test, and the results can be used to calculate the heat generation rate. Paraffin is used as phase change material in this passive thermal management system. Thermal model of the system is established by finite element analysis (FEA) software, and the result is validated with experimental data. Compared to nature convection and forced air cooling, the maximum temperature of the cell decreases a little after using paraffin as phase change material.

The entire electrical powertrain is composed of the motor and inverter, power battery and vehicle heating. The powertrains are tested by vehicle simulation on an electrical test bench and by vehicle modeling. Vehicle simulation and model are complementary to develop and optimize the electrical powertrain system. Two different motors (induction motor with no cooling system and induction motor with forced air cooling system) are tested with two different power Li-ions battery packs. Energetic consumption, thermal management and vehicle dynamic comparisons are made by driving cycles on both vehicle simulation bench and vehicle model. The best choices about powertrain system and battery for the new electrical car are made.

AB This paper proposes an integrated energy and thermal management (IETM) strategy for parallel hybrid electric heavy duty trucks. This supervisory control strategy is developed based on the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) to optimize both the power split (between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric machine) and the heating/cooling power for the battery pack. The method takes into account the concept of State of Function (SOF) describing the capability of the battery as function of State of Charge (SOC) and temperature. Simulation results show the dependence of the global fuel consumption with respect to ambient temperature. Situations are identified where the losses for battery heating/cooling are larger than the benefits from the hybrid powertrain. Hence, an integrated approach between energy and thermal management is needed.

AB The performance of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) or an electric vehicle (EV) is closely related to the performance of its high-voltage battery pack. This is why, among the various means of maintaining a battery's peak performance, the importance of thermal management is emphasized. Since the early stages of the development of Li-ion batteries, much emphasis has been placed on battery cooling in order to secure stability, while less attention has been given to battery heating. However, in a low-temperature environment, using a battery without heating it severely undermines the battery's performance and life expectancy. A PHEV or an EV operates with energy that is stored by charging the battery, which can then be heated by an external source in a low-temperature environment prior to driving. In this study, a battery HILS and an environment simulation system are used to verify that pre-heating a battery in a low-temperature environment, using an external source, such as a charging stand, improves the battery's performance as compared to circumstances in which this is neglected.

In this study, a numerical model for the cooling system of batteries was constructed. Using the constructed analysis model, the material of the cartridge and the cartridge width were checked for improving the performance of the cooling system of batteries. The performance was changed by using different cartridge material, and the cartridge width also has an effect to the performance of the cooling system of batteries as shown in the analysis results.

AB A hybrid power composed of the fuel cell and battery has become a good strategy for REV, but the performance of the battery cooling systems can not be easily adjusted. In this study, heat flux of the batteries and mass flow rate of cooling air have been investigated to improve the performance of a battery cooling system. As shown in the results, the error of root mean square has been decreased under the condition of decreasing heat flux of the batteries, and the performance of the battery cooling system has been improved with increasing the mass flow rate of cooling air. The analysis model developed in this study can be widly used to find out an optimal battery cooling system in the future work.

AB Cell temperature is critical to the life and performance of a battery pack, therefore accurately modeling the complete thermal system is important. Traditional approaches use complex 3D heat transfer and CFD or use a 1D network solver for quick prediction of flow and thermal fields. The 1D and 3D models are linked to get an overall system model. However, this coupling procedure can be tedious and time-consuming. This paper introduces a complete thermal modeling methodology that offers approaches for modeling thermal management system combining the benefits of 1D and 3D models in a single system greatly reducing the model development and analysis time. A new software package, ADFlo, developed with the support of the US Army is used to demonstrate these benefits. This approach is applied to the thermal management system for a battery pack where flow balancing of the coolant has a significant impact on the performance of the system. Properly balanced flow will create an even temperature distribution increasing the performance and life of the system. This will be seen on a 3D solid model of the battery. The analyst can use this to study the effects of modification to the cold plate to ensure an even temperature.

AB This paper presents theory, experiments and numerical modeling results for the electrothermal analysis of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery cells. Thermal management of batteries is important for several reasons including thermal runaway and maintaining battery operating time. A battery pack is comprised of battery cells which are stacked together without cooling surfaces except for the pack outer surface. The central cells in the pack are therefore exposed to the risk of overheating.
   A model for a single specific commercial LiFePO4 battery cell is presented together with preliminary experiments and results for determination of heating sources during charging and discharging. Based on the experimental results we extract model parameters for use in the model. The experiments lead to relations for the cell surface temperature and the lump temperature of the cell. A reasonable agreement between experiments and the model is found and suggestions for further work is indicated.

AB The heat generation model and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model for lithium ion cells were established with boundary conditions defined. In order to provide a better insight about the behaviors of high-power lithium ion cells under realistic discharge conditions, the temperature difference of the cells and an active thermal management system with a pure air-cooling mode were analyzed and predicted with the factors affecting the unevenness of temperature field discussed. The results show a significant effect of the cooling flow rate on the temperature rise of the cells for all discharge rates. Average surface temperatures are relatively uniform at lower discharge rate that makes it easier to control the temperature of the pack. Cell temperatures are expected to rise significantly toward the end of discharge and they show non-uniformity at higher discharge rates. Adequate air flow rate of active cooling is required at high discharge rate and high ambient temperature for practical pack thermal management system.

AB Thermal energy management performance of ageing commercial rectangular LiFePO4 power batteries using phase change material (PCM) and thermal behavior related to thermal conductivity between the PCM and the cell are discussed in this paper. The heat sources are simplified according to the experimental results of the cells discharged at 35 A (approximate to 5 C). 3-D modules of a single cell and battery pack are formulated, respectively. The results show that the thermal resistance in the cell leads to an inevitable temperature difference. It is necessary to improve the thermal conductivity and to lower the melting point of the PCM for heat transfer enhancement. The PCM with a melting point lower than 45 degrees C will be more effective for heat dissipation, with a desired maximum temperature below 50 degrees C. The temperature difference in the whole unit before PCM melting will be decreased significantly. In addition, a proper k(PCM):k(c) is necessary for a well designed battery thermal energy management system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Battery fast charging is one of the most significant and difficult techniques affecting the commercialization of electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, we propose a fast charge framework based on model predictive control, with the aim of simultaneously reducing the charge duration, which represents the out-of-service time of vehicles, and the increase in temperature, which represents safety and energy efficiency during the charge process. The RC model is employed to predict the future State of Charge (SOC). A single mode lumped-parameter thermal model and a neural network trained by real experimental data are also applied to predict the future temperature in simulations and experiments respectively. A genetic algorithm is then applied to find the best charge sequence under a specified fitness function, which consists of two objectives: minimizing the charging duration and minimizing the increase in temperature. Both simulation and experiment demonstrate that the Pareto front of the proposed method dominates that of the most popular constant current constant voltage (CCCV) charge method.

AB Three main types of battery chemistries in consideration for vehicle applications are Pb-acid, nickel-metal hydride, and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are widely used in traditional automotive applications for many years. Higher voltage, high-rate discharge capability, good specific energy, lower temperature performance, lower thermal management requirement, and low-cost in both manufacturing and recycling are the advantages of the rechargeable battery. Disadvantages of the lead-acid battery are: weight concerns of lead metal (lower energy density and lower power density) and limited cycle-life (especially in deep-cycle duties). If two major disadvantages have been significantly changed to a proper state to compete with other battery chemistries, the Pb-acid battery is still a good candidate in considering of cost/performance ratio. The lead-acid battery is always a good power source for fast starting of cold vehicles, for recharging from either a stop-start braking system, or for a charge from the engine itself, which consumes battery energy or stores electricity back into chemical energy. The main reasons for reexamining this battery chemistry are cost-savings and life-cycling considerations upon advances in electrode structure design and enhancement of capacitance behavior inside the battery pack. Several Pb-acid batteries were evaluated and tested through a unique method, i.e., the electrochemical impedance method at different loads, in order to characterize and further understand the improved electrode processes and mechanisms in performance enhancement. The impedance data at loads were collected from these lead-acid batteries at load for further analysis. Battery electrode behaviors are evaluated through impedance data simulation using a proper equivalent circuit model. A defective battery and a failed Pb-acid battery were used in non-destructive analysis. The recent Pb-acid battery advancement in structures and designs and its potential application are also discussed for power reserve in energy-efficient vehicles and sustainable electricity storage.

AB This manuscript discusses the development of a 3D thermal model for a power-split hybrid powertrain, including its battery modules and power electronics. The 3D model utilizes a finite differencing (FD) heat transfer algorithm, complemented with experimental boundary conditions. The experimental setup is configured to acquire the battery current, voltage, and its inner and surface temperatures in discrete and in full-field scans. The power-split hybrid configuration is tested using a standard and artificial driving cycles. A battery resistance model is then used to couple the experimental boundary conditions with the finite differencing code, which employed a cell-based internal heat generation model to describe the pack chemical reaction mechanism. This study presents a complete analysis based on battery current and voltage in relation to vehicle speed. The proposed model also predicts the powertrain spatial and temporal temperature profiles in agreement with the vehicle actual conditions as indicated by the On-Board Diagnosis (OBD) module.

AB This paper examines a passive thermal management system for electric vehicle batteries, consisting of encapsulated phase change material (PCM) which melts during a process to absorb the heat generated by a battery. A new configuration for the thermal management system, using double series PCM shells, is analyzed with finite volume simulations. A combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and second law analysis is used to evaluate and compare the new system against the single PCM shells. Using a finite volume method, heat transfer in the battery pack is examined and the results are used to analyse the exergy losses. The simulations provide design guidelines for the thermal management system to minimize the size and cost of the system. The thermal conductivity and melting temperature are studied as two important parameters in the configuration of the shells. Heat transfer from the surroundings to the PCM shell in a non-insulated case is found to be infeasible. For a single PCM system, the exergy efficiency is below 50%. For the second case for other combinations, the exergy efficiencies ranged from 30-40%. The second shell content did not have significant influence on the exergy efficiencies. The double PCM shell system showed higher exergy efficiencies than the single PCM shell system (except a case for type PCM-1). With respect to the reference environment, it is found that in all cases the exergy efficiencies decreased, when the dead-state temperatures rises, and the destroyed exergy content increases gradually. For the double shell systems for all dead-state temperatures, the efficiencies were very similar. Except for a dead-state temperature of 302 K, with the other temperatures, the exergy efficiencies for different combinations are well over 50%. The range of exergy efficiencies vary widely between 15 and 85% for a single shell system, and between 30-80% for double shell systems.

AB A challenging problem in energy storage systems for stand-by application, to obtain the best performance from the lithium cell battery packs/module, is the:
   Cells homogeneity,
   low and high operative temperature,
   cells and module balancing. In order to reduce these problems FAAM Group S.p.A., developed:
   a method for the selection and classification of homogenous cells to form uniform battery pack using Self Organizing Maps neural networks.

AB This paper examines and optimizes parameters that affect the air cooling of a Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery, used in Electric Vehicles (EVs). A battery pack containing 150 cylindrical type Li-Ion battery cells in a PVC casing is investigated. An equal number of tubes are used in the pack as a medium to cool the battery by using a fan when the vehicle is stationary or with ambient air when in motion. The parameters affecting the air cooling of battery are studied and optimized by considering their practical constraints. The objective function and Number of Transfer Unit (NTU) are developed. Finally, a genetic algorithm method is employed to optimize the decision variables. Analysing the results shows that NTU can be maximized by increasing the diameter of tubes on the battery and keeping the air velocity in a certain range.

AB The paraffin/graphite composite phase change materials (PCMs) for battery thermal management system (BTMS) were prepared in thermostatic water bath. X-ray diffraction test shows that there is no chemical reaction between the paraffin and the graphite. The energy storage properties of the paraffin/graphite composite PCMs were characterized by Differential scanning calorimetry. The total latent heat was reduced with the increasing of the mass fraction of graphite. As the PCMs must have high thermal conductivity and be insulated, the proposed mass fraction of graphite is 20 wt% and the total latent heat is 89.6% as great as that of the pure paraffin, which may be the best for BTMS.

AB This paper describes a model identification procedure for identifying an electro-thermal model of lithium ion batteries used in automotive applications. The dynamic model structure adopted is based on an equivalent circuit model whose parameters are scheduled on the state-of-charge, temperature, and current direction. Linear spline functions are used as the functional form for the parametric dependence. The model identified in this way is valid inside a large range of temperatures and state-of-charge, so that the resulting model can be used for automotive applications such as on-board estimation of the state-of-charge and state-of-health. The model coefficients are identified using a multiple step genetic algorithm based optimization procedure designed for large scale optimization problems. The validity of the procedure is demonstrated experimentally for an A123 lithium ion iron-phosphate battery. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium-ion batteries are well-suited for fully electric and hybrid electric vehicles due to their high specific energy and energy density relative to other rechargeable cell chemistries. However, these batteries have not been widely deployed commercially in these vehicles yet due to safety, cost, and poor low temperature performance, which are all challenges related to battery thermal management. In this paper, a critical review of the available literature on the major thermal issues for lithium-ion batteries is presented. Specific attention is paid to the effects of temperature and thermal management on capacity/power fade, thermal runaway, and pack electrical imbalance and to the performance of lithium-ion cells at cold temperatures. Furthermore, insights gained from previous experimental and modeling investigations are elucidated. These include the need for more accurate heat generation measurements, improved modeling of the heat generation rate, and clarity in the relative magnitudes of the various thermal effects observed at high charge and discharge rates seen in electric vehicle applications. From an analysis of the literature, the requirements for lithium-ion thermal management systems for optimal performance in these applications are suggested, and it is clear that no existing thermal management strategy or technology meets all these requirements.

AB Battery fast charging is a crucial issue in both research and application to realize and promote the mass commercialization of electric vehicles, especially pure electric vehicles. However, due to the strong nonlinear properties of batteries, the charging process should take into consideration various factors such as state of charge (SoC), temperature, and charging current, so as to assure the safety, reduce charging time, and enhance charging efficiency. In this paper, we propose a fast charging strategy under the model predictive control framework. Two models are employed to predict SoC and temperature under a sequence of future charging currents. SoC predictor is based on RC equivalent circuit and temperature predictor is based on thermal conduction and convection. The prediction of battery future states allows optimization of the control sequence, with the objectives to follow a predetermined SoC trajectory and to minimize battery temperature rising. Genetic algorithm is introduced to solve the constrained multi-objective optimization problem. The results using Advisor platform demonstrate the availability and efficacy of the proposed framework and prove that it has the ability to reduce charging time and heat generation simultaneously.

Indeed, the implementation of such a model within the Battery Management System makes it possible to evaluate the status and the behavior of the battery pack in every condition and to apply a correct control strategy. This work shows the characterization and modeling of a commercial Lithium-Polymer cell, which properly considers thermal effects on cell behavior.

AB In this paper, blocks for the thermal management of Li-ion battery are prepared. The blocks are made of paraffin wax, which is used as a phase change material (PCM), and graphite flakes. The process starts by compacting expanded graphite into the desired modular shapes and then impregnating it into molten paraffin wax. The modular pieces were assembled together, followed by finishing operations to achieve a desired packaging geometry.
   Thermo-mechanical properties of the produced phase change material-expanded graphite (PCM/EG) composites have been studied. The tests include thermal conductivity. tensile compression and bursting test. The results showed that as mass fraction of paraffin wax increases in the composite material, the thermal conductivity. tensile strength, compression strength, and burst strength were improved while tested at low operating temperatures. In contrast, the results showed reverse behaviors when tested at relatively high operating temperature. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The developed model has a simple structure but can capture sufficient dynamics under both temperature and state of charge (SoC) variation, thus making it applicable for use with real-time model-based estimation algorithms (for example, in state of charge and state of health estimation). A systematic procedure is outlined for the data acquisition and identification process, and experimental results are presented for an A123 lithium-ion iron phosphate battery.

AB Li-ion batteries are today considered the prime solution as energy storage system for EV/PHEV/HEV due to their high specific energy and power Since their performance, life and reliability are influenced by the operating temperature, great interest has been devoted to study different cooling solutions and control algorithms for thermal management.
   In this context, this paper presents a computationally efficient modeling approach to characterize the internal temperature distribution of a Li-ion battery cell, conceived to serve as a tool to aid the design of cooling systems and the development of thermal management systems for automotive battery packs. The model is developed starting from the unsteady heat diffusion equation, for which an analytical solution is obtained through the integral transform method. First, a general one-dimensional thermal model is developed to predict the temperature distribution inside a prismatic Li-ion battery cell under different boundary conditions. Then, a specific case with convective boundary conditions is studied with the objective of characterizing a cell cooled by a forced airflow. To characterize the effects of the cooling system on the temperature distribution within the cell, the one-dimensional solution is then extended to a 1+1D model that accounts for the variability of the boundary conditions in the flow direction.
   The calibration and validation of the specific model presented will be presented, adopting a detailed 2D FEM simulator as a benchmark.

AB A passive thermal management system is evaluated for high-power Li-ion packs under stressful or abusive conditions, and compared with a purely air-cooling mode under normal and abuse conditions. A compact and properly designed passive thermal management system utilizing phase change material (PCM) provides faster heat dissipation than active cooling during high pulse power discharges while preserving sufficiently uniform cell temperature to ensure the desirable cycle life for the pack. This study investigates how passive cooling with PCM contributes to preventing the propagation of thermal runaway in a single cell or adjacent cells due to a cell catastrophic failure. Its effectiveness is compared with that of active cooling by forced air flow or natural convection using the same compact module and pack configuration corresponding to the PCM matrix technology. The effects of nickel tabs and spacing between the cells were also studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of recently announced battery packs for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) shows that the design of the series-parallel combinations is being over-complicated. The proven energy densities of lithium-ion cells from about 200 Wh/kg are being reduced to 90 Wh/kg. The majority of the weight increase seems to be for thermal management. Simpler battery pack designs based on electro-refining pot rooms using self-contained rectangular lithium-ion cells with air cooling inside of die-cast magnesium cell tanks would help avoid hauling dead weight in PHEV by providing considerable weight reduction.

AB Battery forms a critical part of the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) drivetrain. An important constraint to the effective performance and reliability of the battery is its unpredictable internal resistance variation along the driving cycle. Temperature has a considerable effect on this internal resistance and thus the battery management system monitors cell and battery pack temperature in accordance with the state-of-charge to prevent thermal runaway. Li-ion batteries which offer possible solutions to the HEVs energy and power density demands thus need to have a good thermal management system in order to enhance their performance. This paper aims to develop a battery pack model that would analyze the variation of internal resistance as a function of temperature. The study of the losses would help in designing a cost effective efficient battery management system.

AB The work presented in this paper examines the use of pure hydrogen fuelled high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (HTPEM) fuel cell stacks in an electrical car, charging a Li-ion battery pack. The car is equipped with two branches of two series coupled 1 kW fuel cell stacks which are connected directly parallel to the battery pack during operation. This enables efficient charging of the batteries for increased driving range. With no power electronics used, the fuel cell stacks follow the battery pack voltage, and charge the batteries passively. This saves the electrical and economical losses related to these components and their added system complexity. The new car battery pack consists of 23 Li-ion battery cells and the charging and discharging are monitored by a battery management system (BMS) which ensures safe operating conditions for the batteries. The direct connection of the fuel cell stacks to the batteries can only be made if the stacks are carefully dimensioned to the battery voltage. The experimental results of stationary fuel cell charging are presented, showing stable and efficient operation. (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A strategy for Portable high-power applications with a controlled thermal environment has been developed and has demonstrated the advantage Of using the novel phase change material(PCM) thermal management systems over conventional active cooling systems. A passive thermal management system using PCM for Li-ion batteries is tested for extreme conditions, such as ambient temperature of 45 degrees C and discharge rate of 2.08C-rate (10A). Contrary to Li-ion packs without thermal management system, high-energy packs with PCM are discharged safely at high currents and degrading rate of capacity of the Li-ion packs lowered by half. Moreover, the compactness of the packs not only decreases the Volume Occupied by the packs and its associated complex cooling system, but also decreases the total weight for large power application.

AB The effectiveness of passive cooling by phase change materials (PCM) is compared with that of active (forced air) cooling. Numerical simulations were performed at different discharge rates, operating temperatures and ambient temperatures of a compact Li-ion battery pack suitable for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) propulsion. The results were also compared with experimental results. The PCM cooling mode uses a micro-composite graphite-PCM matrix surrounding the array of cells, while the active cooling mode uses air blown through the gaps between the cells in the same array. The results show that at stressful conditions, i.e. at high discharge rates and at high operating or ambient temperatures (for example 40-45 degrees C), air-cooling is not a proper thermal management system to keep the temperature of the cell in the desirable operating range without expending significant fan power. On the other hand, the passive cooling system is able to meet the operating range requirements under these same stressful conditions without the need for additional fan power. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
