AB A model-based dynamic analysis of a variable-speed wind generator system consisting of an induction generator connected to the grid through a full power frequency converter is conducted. To this end, a nonlinear modeling of the entire system is used in a manner that permits a novel controller design with common structure for both the generator-and gridside converters. The proposed controller, acting directly on the duty-ratio inputs of the converters, ensures the boundedness of the duty-ratio signals in the permitted range although its structure is independent from the system parameters and open to different control objectives. Therefore, maximum power point tracking and power factor correction are easily implemented. Furthermore, the controller is proven to guarantee stability of the whole system under field-or near-field-oriented conditions without needing any flux measurement or estimation. Hence, the main contribution established by this approach is that a rigorous stability analysis taking into account the generator, converters, dc link, and controller dynamics is presented on the basis of a complete system modeling and controller design approach. The theoretical analysis and controller effectiveness are confirmed via extended simulation results for a commercial size 2-MW induction generator operating under varied wind speed conditions and are further validated on a similar system with real-time results.

ID DESIGN
AB For conventional HAWT (horizontal axis wind turbines), the rotor speed is maintained constant while the blade tip speed changes continuously. This reduces considerably the power performance of the wind turbine particularly at high wind speeds where the tip speed ratio is small. With growth of variable speed generators, a compact BEM (blade element momentum) analysis is derived to design optimal blades for continuously variable speed HAWTs. First, a generalized quadratic equation on the angular induction factor is introduced which is related to local axial induction factor, blade local speed ratio, and drag to lift ratio. Second, the optimal blade geometry is obtained for which the maximum power coefficient is calculated at different design tip speed ratios and drag to lift ratios by assuming variable operational speed. Third, it is demonstrated that the power performance of the variable speed wind turbine is significantly higher than the conventional constant speed wind turbines. In addition, the present BEM modeling may be useful to reduce the computational effort of iterative numerical methods used in determining off-design power performance of conventional wind turbines with constant speed.

AB This study deals with the analysis, design and control of single voltage source converter (VSC)-based grid connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) for wind energy conversion system (WECS) with maximum power point tracking capability. This proposed system uses stator flux-based model reference adaptive system algorithm for the sensorless rotor position estimation. In this proposed topology, grid side converter is replaced by a battery energy storage system (BESS) in the dc link. The designs of all the components such as BESS, VSC and wind turbine are explained in detail. This proposed topology is implemented using a digital signal processor. This developed WECS is tested extensively in sub-synchronous, synchronous and super-synchronous speeds regions and test results are presented in all these cases. The performance of this proposed topology is demonstrated for the dynamics in wind speed by the experimental verification. A comparative study of proposed single VSC-based WECS system is made with the conventional double VSC-based DFIG.

AB The improved structure of stand-alone wind power system which is presented in this paper based on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). A Li-ion battery energy storage system is used to compensate the inherent power fluctuations (excess or shortage) and to regulate the overall system operation based on a power management strategy. The modeling and the control of a DFIG for stand-alone power applications are detailed. However, the magnitude and frequency of the DFIG stator output voltage are controlled under variable mechanical speed. This task is ensured via the control of d and q components of the rotor flux by means of a back-to-back pulse width modulation (PWM) converter connected to the rotor side of the DFIG. The PMSM is coupled mechanically to the wind turbine and supplies a required power to the PWM converter in order to regulate the dc bus voltage to the desired value.
   In order to validate the proposed stand-alone wind power supply structure both a theoretical system analysis and a complete simulation of the overall wind energy conversion system (WECS) with Li-ion battery energy storage system is carried out to prove the performances of the control strategy.

AB This paper presents a method for estimating the fixed and variable speed turbine performance index. The approach is based on Weibull wind probability distribution function and manufacturer-provided power curve. It is further shown that the existing turbine performance index formulation is only valid in case of variable speed turbines. A general approach to calculating the turbine performance index is derived, suitable for both fixed and variable speed wind turbines. Instead of choosing a particular model for approximating the power curve, commonly used polynomial fitting is employed. It is suggested to determine the best site for a given off-the-shelf turbine rather than finding the best theoretical turbine for a given site.

AB The penetration of intermittent wind and solar power to the grid network above manageable limits disrupts electrical power grids. Consequently, hydraulic turbines synchronized to the grid experience total load rejection and are forced to shut down immediately. The turbine runner accelerates to runaway speeds in a few seconds, inducing high-amplitude, unsteady pressure loading on the blades. This sometimes results in a failure of the turbine components. Moreover, the unsteady pressure loading significantly affects the operating life of the turbine runner. Transient measurements were carried out on a scale model of a Francis turbine prototype (specific speed = 0.27) during an emergency shutdown with a transition into total load rejection. A detailed analysis of variables such as the head, discharge, pressure at different locations including the runner blades, shaft torque, and the guide vane angular movements are performed. The maximum amplitudes of the unsteady pressure fluctuations in the turbine were observed under a runaway condition. The amplitudes were 2.1 and 2.6 times that of the pressure loading at the best efficiency point in the vaneless space and runner, respectively. Such high-amplitude, unsteady pressure pulsations can affect the operating life of the turbine.

AB A hydro-viscous transmission based continuously variable speed wind turbine is proposed in this paper to smooth the output power fluctuations in the full-load region. The hydro-viscous transmission concept is based upon mature technology and is characterized by low production cost and high reliability. Torque characteristics and transmission efficiency of this type of wind turbine are analyzed. A particle swarm optimization algorithm based multi-objective optimization method is employed to optimally design the hydro-viscous transmission. Major components of the wind power system have been mathematically modeled and analyzed in detail. Furthermore, a hybrid output power control strategy is proposed and implemented to precisely control the generated power and torque for this system. This wind power system has been validated by a theoretical analysis and a comparative simulation study. The simulation results by using an actual detailed model show the achievement of quite satisfactory performances of smoothing power and torque fluctuations despite the varying wind speed.

AB Production losses and increased turbine loadings are observed in wind farms, when wind turbines interact with each other. If a wind turbine is located in the wake of another one, its incoming flow is disturbed, slowed down, and its potential wind power is decreased. It is therefore necessary to study the wind turbine wakes and their interactions. It is important to consider these wake effects in the design of a wind farm in order to maximize the energy output and lifetime of the machines. The exact modeling of the wind speed distribution within a wind park is a fairly complicated task and many of the necessary parameters are not routinely available. A large number of studies have been established concerning the calculation of wake effect. Even though a number of mathematical functions have been proposed, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time. Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used as alternative to analytical approach as ANN offers advantages such as no required knowledge of internal system parameters, compact solution for multi-variable problems and fast calculation. In this investigation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which is a specific type of the ANN family, was used to predict the wake power deficit. Neural network in ANFIS adjusts parameters of membership function in the fuzzy logic of the fuzzy inference system (FIS). This intelligent algorithm is implemented using Matlab/Simulink and the performances are investigated. The simulation results presented in this paper show the effectiveness of the developed method.

AB -In this article, a novel control strategy is proposed to exploit the full capability, in terms of active filtering, of a wind energy conversion system based on a doubly fed induction generator. To achieve control of the wind energy conversion system, the rotor of the doubly fed induction generator is connected to the grid through a back-to-back pulse-width modulation converter. The proposed algorithm is applied to the rotor-side converter to ensure simultaneous active power production and power quality improvement. Depending on the nominal rotor-side converter power, the control strategy manages the wind energy conversion system function priorities between active power production, reactive power compensation, and current active-selective filtering without any system overrating. This study's main goal is to exploit the full capability of the rotor-side converter in terms of active and selective filtering. In fact, it is proposed to eliminate the whole harmonic currents if possible, or to compensate the fifth and the seventh predominant components and a part of the rest of the harmonic currents. Otherwise, one may filter a part of these two predominant harmonics in such a way that the rotor-side converter operates at its full capacitance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB The analytic wind and wave climate modeling is important for a variety of ocean engineering applications. Usually, the probabilistic description of the wind and wave regime is confined to the linear characteristics of sea states and wind conditions, i.e., the significant wave height, wave period and wind speed. Rapidly emerging applications, such as offshore wind and wave energy utilization, are largely dependent on the accurate description of the directional wind and wave characteristics of the areas under study. In this work, two analytic bivariate probability models for the joint distributions of: (a) significant wave height-wave direction, (b) wind speed-wind direction and (c) wave direction-wind direction are presented, discussed and applied in detail. The proposed models, which take into consideration the dependence of the corresponding variables and are defined by closed-form relations, are theoretically sound and tractable. Numerical results are provided for three locations along the US coasts, which are characterized by different characteristics of wind and wave climate. The proposed joint distributions elucidate the probabilistic structure of the wind and wave climate patterns and, furthermore, they allow the assessment of the special and important cases of aligned and opposing wind and sea states.

TI Thickness Dependence of Ice Removal Stress for a Polydimethylsiloxane

AB Minimizing adhesion of ice has been the subject of extensive studies because of importance to applications such aircraft wings, spacecraft, and power transmission wires. A growing interest concerns coatings for wind turbine blades and refrigeration. Herein, a new laboratory test was employed to obtain the thickness dependence of ice adhesion for Sylgard 184a filled polydimethylsiloxane elastomer. A correlation between ice adhesion and coating thickness (t) was found that follows a relationship developed by Kendall over 40 years ago for removal of a rigid object from an elastomer. With a 0.05 mm/s probe speed a nearly linear relationship between peak removal stress (P-s) and 1/t(1/2) was obtained with P-s similar to 460 kPa for an 18 mu m coating, decreasing to similar to 120 kPa for 533 mu m. Preliminary results suggest that below similar to 10 mu m Ps departs from the 1/t(1/2) correlation while above similar to 500 mu m a limiting value for P-s may be reached. We previously reported that probe speed has negligible effect on the glassy polymer PMMA. In contrast, probe speed is identified as an important variable for testing ice release on elastomeric Sylgard 184 coatings. While work of adhesion, which is related to surface free energy, is recognized as an important factor that can affect ice release, the results reported herein show that coating thickness can override this single parameter for elastomeric substrates.

AB This paper presents a novel gearless and brushless power split transmission system for variable-speed constant-frequency wind power generation application. The core element of this system is a novel axial-flux doubly fed dual-rotor permanent magnet machine. The key of the design is to utilize the flux modulation principle to modulate the magnetic flux in an axial-flux machine and use doubly fed stator winding to control the rotor rotation. This design combines the merits of direct-drive machines and doubly fed generators. As the mechanical problems related to brushes, slip rings, and gear boxes are successfully overcome, the operational reliability of the system is improved. The stator winding of the proposed system can be directly connected to the power grid, and the power rating of its associated frequency converter is reduced. Time-stepping finite-element method is used to analyze the dynamic performance of the proposed system.

AB Wind turbine drivetrains consist of components that directly convert kinetic energy from the wind to electrical energy. Therefore, guaranteeing robust and reliable drivetrain designs is important to prevent turbine downtime. Current drivetrain models often lack the ability to model both the impacts of electrical transients as well as wind turbulence and shear in one package. In this paper, the capability of the FAST wind turbine computer-aided-engineering tool, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, is enhanced through the integration of a dynamic model of the drivetrain. The dynamic drivetrain model is built using Simscape in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and incorporates detailed electrical generator models. This model can be used to evaluate internal drivetrain loads due to excitations from both the wind and generator.

AB The configuration permanent-magnet synchronous generator with a diode bridge is frequently used in small wind energy conversion systems due to its reliability and low cost. In order to perform a sensorless maximum power point tracking, a suitable method consists of imposing the relationship between the dc current and the dc voltage in optimum operation. However, this strategy requires having knowledge of the system parameters, which are inaccurately known and can vary in real applications. Thus, the optimum curve is not precisely obtained, leading to power losses. This paper evaluates to what extent the power is reduced due to parameter errors. It is shown how the power can be drastically decreased due to some parameter variation, whereas it is not affected by others such as the resistance, which can then be neglected in order to simplify the model. Simulation results for an actual wind profile validate the theoretical analysis.

AB This paper proposes a new control strategy for an optimal extraction of output power from stand-alone windmill systems. The system consists of a variable-speed wind turbine directly coupled to a PMSG (permanent magnet synchronous generator), a diode bridge rectifier, a DC-to-DC boost converter, and a battery bank. This control method, with its higher speed, directly creates a control signal for handling DC-to-DC converters. Adding an ESN (echo state network) to this method can result in extracting maximum power from the wind turbine without measuring the wind speed. This system is then simulated using MATLAB-SIMULINK software. The obtained simulation results show that the objective of extracting maximum power from the wind is reached. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a novel FLC MPPT (fuzzy logic sensorless maximum power point tracking) method for WECS (wind energy conversion systems). The proposed method greatly reduces the speed variation range of the wind generator which leads to the downsizing the PWM (pulse width modulation) back-to-back converters by approximately 40% in comparison with conventional techniques. The method also increases the system's reliability by reducing the converter losses. Firstly, a MRAS (model reference adaptive system) based on fuzzy logic technique is used to estimate the DFIG (doubly-fed induction generator) rotor's speed. Then, a FLC MPPT (Fuzzy Logic Maximum Power Point Tracking) method is applied to provide the reference electromagnetic torque. Subsequently, in order to achieve the overall sensorless MPPT technique, the wind power is approximated from estimated generator speed and the reference of electromagnetic torque. Finally, the wind speed is estimated from the mechanical power using a fuzzy logic technique. The proposed control method has been applied to a WTG (wind turbine generator) driving a 3.7 kW DFIG in variable speed mode. In order to validate the simulation results, experimental tests have been performed on a 3.7 kW test bench, consisting of a DFIG and DC motor drive. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a project management methodology designed for the selection of wind turbines wake effect most influential parameters, who need to run wind farm project for large energy conversion. Very frequently, the managers of these projects are not project management professionals, so they need guidance to have autonomy, using minimal time and documentation resources. Therefore, agile method is adapted to assist the project management. Wind energy poses challenges such as the reduction in the wind speed due to the wake effect by other turbines. If a turbine is within the area of turbulence caused by another turbine, or the area behind another turbine, the wind speed suffers a reduction and, therefore, there is a decrease in the production of electricity. In order to increase the efficiency of a wind farm, analyzing the parameters, which have influence on the wake effect, is one of the focal research areas. To maximize the power produced in a wind farm, it is important to determine and analyze the most influential factors on the wake effects or wake wind speeds since the effect has most influence on the produced power. This procedure is typically called variable selection, and it corresponds to finding a subset of the full set of recorded variables that exhibits good predictive abilities. In this study, architecture for modeling complex systems in function approximation and regression was used, based on using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Variable searching using the ANFIS network was performed to determine how the five parameters affect the wake wind speed. Our article answers the call for renewing the theoretical bases of wind farm project management in order to overcome the problems that stem from the application of methods based on decision-rationality norms, which bracket the complexity of action and interactions in projects.

AB This work forms the first of a two-part investigation aimed at identifying the challenges and opportunities of implementing a direct-drive generator for a spar-buoy type floating wind turbine. Preliminary specifications are presented for a fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic model of a floating wind turbine with a 5MW direct-drive generator. The drive-train model uses a low-speed, high-torque radial flux permanent magnet generator supported by two main-shaft bearings. The mechanical properties of the drive-train, including the main dimensions, mass of major nacelle equipment and details for the hub/nacelle assembly are presented. The rationale behind the adjustments to the tower and platform properties and the motivation to selection of best arrangement that is appropriate for supporting the developed system is explained. A discussion on the development of the variable speed-variable pitch control system suitable for the direct-drive system including modifications to avoid negative damping and blade-pitch instability are presented. Fully coupled simulations for the developed aero-hydro-servo elastic model were carried out in HAWC2 for the normal operating conditions of the wind turbine. The aerodynamic response of the model was verified and compared with that of a geared floating wind turbine system. Some initial results comparing the main shaft loads of the land-based and floating versions of the direct-drive wind turbine suggest satisfactory dynamic behaviour of the drive-train. The results prompt further research using a detailed drive-train model to verify the internal response, loading and durability of the components to assess their compatibility with a floating wind turbine system.

AB Due to variations of wind speed, the output power of small-scaled or mid-scaled wind farms is fluctuating and this may negatively impact the power system. This paper proposes anew fuzzy PID controller scheme for a variable speed wind farm. In this scheme, by using the rotor-inertia as an energy storage system, two purposes are satisfied. Firstly, the optimal power point of each turbine is tracked in such a way that the total output power of the wind farm is also smoothed. Secondly, the proposed scheme enables the wind farm to produce a predetermined output power. To show the performance of the proposed scheme, a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farm is simulated and the results are compared with conventional scheme. Also, the tracking capability of the pre-scheduled output power is verified. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of designing a nonlinear feedback control scheme for variable speed wind turbines, without wind speed measurements, in below rated wind conditions was addressed. The objective is to operate the wind turbines in order to have maximum wind power extraction while also the mechanical loads are reduced. Two control strategies were proposed seeking a better performance. The first strategy uses a tracking controller that ensures the optimal angular velocity for the rotor. The second strategy uses a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm while a non-homogeneous quasi-continuous high-order sliding mode controller is applied to ensure the power tracking. Two algorithms were developed to solve the tracking control problem for the first strategy. The first one is a sliding mode output feedback torque controller combined with a wind speed estimator. The second algorithm is a quasi-continuous high-order sliding mode controller to ensure the speed tracking. The proposed controllers are compared with existing control strategies and their performance is validated using a FAST model based on the Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART). The controllers show a good performance in terms of energy extraction and load reduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel current-based direct power control (CB-DPC) strategy for a grid-connected doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is proposed. The reported control scheme is applicable to DFIG-based variable-speed wind turbines that operate under unbalanced network voltages. The required DFIG rotor voltage for precise regulation of the stator active and reactive output powers and accurate elimination of their inherent pulsations are directly obtained using a nonlinear integral sliding-mode control (ISMC) scheme. Compared with other control methods, the proposed strategy is simpler since it is not based on the symmetrical components theory, does not need multiple synchronous coordinate transformations, and only requires DFIG voltage and current values as its inputs. Constant switching frequency of the rotor-side converter (RSC) is achieved by means of space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM) technique. Uncertainties in the parameters of the generator are included in the design. A compensation strategy is also proposed for tracking error mitigation of the powers that occur due to elimination of the chattering phenomena in the ISMC scheme. Simulation results on a 2MW DFIG under different operating conditions are presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A strategy for the detection of bearing faults in variable speed wind turbines with permanent magnet synchronous machines is presented in this paper. The strategy consists on processing the measured vibration signals as well as the machine voltages. From these voltages and using a phase locked loop, the electrical angle is calculated in order to resample vibrations synchronized with rotor position. Then, it is possible to use conventional vibration-based techniques for bearing fault detection even under variable speed operation conditions. Experimental results to validate the proposed strategy are also presented in this work.

AB In this paper, a real time sliding mode control scheme for a variable speed wind turbine that incorporates a doubly feed induction generator is described. In this design, the so-called vector control theory is applied, in order to simplify the system electrical equations. The proposed control scheme involves a low computational cost and therefore can be implemented in real-time applications using a low cost Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The stability analysis of the proposed sliding mode controller under disturbances and parameter uncertainties is provided using the Lyapunov stability theory. A new experimental platform has been designed and constructed in order to analyze the real-time performance of the proposed controller in a real system. Finally, the experimental validation carried out in the experimental platform shows; on the one hand that the proposed controller provides high-performance dynamic characteristics, and on the other hand that this scheme is robust with respect to the uncertainties that usually appear in the real systems.

AB A direct-drive generator that uses a permanent magnet provides higher energy density and fewer constraint conditions. For a sufficient production of output power; however; an electronic machine system with a very large diameter must be used due to the need for operation at a low rotational speed. The structural weight of a direct-drive generator for a large-scale wind turbine can be as much as 80% of the total weight. Among the direct-drive generators, the AFPM (Axial Flux Permanent Magnet)-type machine has been the most attractive due to its higher torque effect per unit volume and higher power density. In this study, shape optimization was accomplished based on the desirability function for a direct-drive generator in 2.5MW wind turbine using the AFPM-type machine proposed in this study Electro-magnetic and structural-coupling analyses were carried out to determine the optimal design variables that would meet the requirements of structural stiffness, such as limitations in air-gap clearance, as well as conforming to acceptable global mechanical behaviors. Compared with the initial generator, the structural weight and stress of the proposed model was reduced by 13.6 and 21% under conditions that satisfied the constraint requirements of the limitations of air-gap clearance.

AB Fault diagnosis of induction machines operating under variable load conditions is still an unsolved matter. Under those regimes, the application of conventional diagnostic techniques is not suitable, since they are adapted to the analysis of stationary quantities. In this context, modern transient-based methodologies become very appropriate. This paper improves a technique, based on the application of Wigner-Ville distribution as time-frequency decomposition tool, using a particle filtering method as feature extraction procedure, to diagnose and quantify electrical asymmetries in induction machines, such as wound-rotor induction generators used in wind farms. The combination of both tools allows tracking several variable frequency harmonics simultaneously and computing their energy with high accuracy, yielding magnitudes and values similar to those obtained by the application of the fast Fourier transform in stationary operation. The experimental results show the validity of the approach for rapid speed variations, independently of any speed sensor.

AB An investigation into the blockage correction effects in wind tunnel experiments of a small-scale wind energy conversion system in an open type test section is carried out. The energy conversion system includes a Savonius-style wind turbine (SSWT) and a power measurement assembly. As the available correlations for the closed type test sections may not be appropriate for the open test section under dynamic loading conditions, new correlations are adapted for the blockage correction factors with free stream wind speed, turbine rotational speed and variable load applied to the turbine to quantify the energy conversion coefficients more precisely. These are obtained for a blockage ratio of 21.16% through a comparison of present experimental data with those of established experimental data under dynamic loading conditions. Further, the accuracy of the adapted correlations is substantiated into the experiments with smaller blockage ratios of 16% and 12.25%. The relationships of the tip speed ratios and blockage ratios with the blockage correction factor are also discussed. Using these correlations, this study provides evidence of increase of blockage correction in the range 1-10% with the increase of both tip speed ratio and blockage ratio. The results also indicate that for blockage ratios approaching 10 and tip speed ratios below 0.5, the blockage effects are almost negligible in the open type test sections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Power optimization and control for grid-coupled wind energy conversion systems (WECS) has been extensively studied for variable speed wind turbines. However, existing methods widely use model-based power optimization algorithms in the outer loop along with linear control techniques in the inner loop. The transient performance of this combination is dependent on the system's operating point, especially under fast varying wind regimes. We employ extremum seeking (ES) in the outer loop, which is a nonmodel-based optimization approach, to perform maximum power point tracking, i.e., extract maximum power from WECS in their subrated power region. Since the convergence rate of the ES design may be limited by the speed of the system dynamics, we also design a nonlinear controller, based on the field-oriented control concept and feedback linearization, that yields improvement in convergence rate by two orders of magnitude. The outer ES loop tunes the turbine speed to maximize power capture for all wind speeds within the subrated power operating conditions. The inner-loop nonlinear control maintains fast transient response through a matrix converter, by regulating the electrical frequency and voltage amplitude of the stator of the (squirrel-cage) induction generator. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed design.

ID INERTIAL RESPONSE; GENERATORS; TURBINES; SUPPORT; RESERVE; IMPACT
AB With the increasing wind penetration level in power systems, transmission system operators have become concerned about frequency stability. The inertia of a variable speed wind turbine is decoupled by power electronic converters from the power network and therefore does not intrinsically contribute to power system inertia. Moreover, as wind plant progressively displaces conventional generation and their inertia, a substantial reduction in power system inertia may occur. Variable speed wind turbines can be controlled to provide synthetic inertial response to compensate for their lack of direct contribution to power system inertia. A probabilistic approach to assessing the collective inertial contributions from wind generation across a power system is proposed and is applied to the Great Britain power system. The impact of the aggregate inertial response on arresting frequency fall is examined for the case of a sudden generation loss of 1.8 GW at the time of minimum load on both a mid-summer and a midwinter day. The results show that synthetic inertial response from wind can reduce the rate of fall of frequency and the minimum system frequency (nadir) following the loss of generation event.

ID TURBINE; MODEL
AB The application of the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy approach for voltage and frequency control of an isolated wind turbine (WT) system with variable-speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and a system for storing energy during wind speed and load variations is investigated. Energy storage systems are needed for power balance and power quality in autonomous wind energy systems. Initially, the holistic model of the entire system is achieved, including the PMSG, the uncontrolled rectifier, the buck converter and the storage system. The power absorbed by the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed WT and energy storage systems, subject to TS-fuzzy control. The main purpose is to supply 230-V/50-Hz through a three-phase inverter. The performance of the proposed system is compared with the system without storage system. Moreover, the proposed system performance with the TS-fuzzy control is compared with the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The simulation results show that the proposed system with the TS-fuzzy controller has good prediction of the electrical parameter waveforms compared with the case of absence of the storage system and the conventional PID controller.

Switched reluctance generators (SRGs) have the potential to be a robust and highly efficient electrical conversion system for variable-speed wind applications. This study presents a new approach for optimising performance of a SRG intended for variable-speed direct drive wind turbine applications. DC bus voltage level and phase voltage switching angles have been identified as control variables affecting power generation. Owing to highly non-linear characteristics of SRG, iterative simulation of the generator model on the range of control variables can be used for finding output power profile. Since it is a multidimensional search space, the number of iterations is very big. Differential evolution (DE) strategy has been introduced to find optimal firing angles and DC bus voltage level under multiple operating conditions. Optimisation of the control variables is performed using a machine model based on the measured characteristics. Selected operating points are experimentally tested using a 4 kW 1500 rpm SRG prototype. DE algorithm is a viable alternative for generating optimal control in multidimensional optimisation of SRG wind energy generation.

AB This paper presents the design of and L-1 adaptive controller for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of a small variable speed wind energy conversion system (WECS). The proposed controller generates the optimal torque command for the vector-controlled generator-side converter based on the wind speed estimation. The proposed MPPT control algorithm has a generic structure and can be used for different generator types. In order to verify the efficacy of the proposed L-1 adaptive controller for the MPPT of the WECS, a full converter wind turbine with a squirrel cage induction generator is used to carry out case studies using MATLAB/Simulink. The case study results show that the designed L-1 adaptive controller has good tracking performance even with unmodeled dynamics and in the presence of parameter uncertainties and unknown disturbances.

AB This paper studies the feasibility of utilizing the reactive power of grid-connected variable-speed wind generators to enhance the steady-state voltage stability margin of the system. Allowing wind generators to work at maximum reactive power limit may cause the system to operate near the steady-state stability limit, which is undesirable. This necessitates proper coordination of reactive power output of wind generators with other reactive power controllers in the grid. This paper presents a trust region framework for coordinating reactive output of wind generators-with other reactive sources for voltage stability enhancement. Case studies on 418-bus equivalent system of Indian southern grid indicates the effectiveness of proposed methodology in enhancing the steady-state voltage stability margin.

AB Maintaining a close balance between power generation and demand is essential for sustaining the quality and reliability of a power system. Currently, due to increased renewable energy generation, frequency deviations and power fluctuations of greater concern are being introduced to the grid, particularly in regions that are weakly interconnected with their surrounding areas, such as small islands. This paper addresses the problem of frequency control in isolated power systems with relevant inclusion of wind power generation. With this aim, we have analyzed the contribution of the demand side to the primary frequency control together with an auxiliary frequency control, which is carried out by variable-speed wind turbines through an additional control loop that synthesizes virtual inertia. We have evaluated both the suitability of these two additional control actions counteracting frequency deviation and their potential reserves and compatibility. The results indicate a substantial improvement in both the dynamic performance and grid frequency stability. Simulations also indicate a decrease in the steady-state frequency error, which may relieve the secondary frequency control.

AB This paper concentrates on the output power smoothing and the grid dynamic response enhancement of a grid-interactive MW-class permanent magnet synchronous generator-based wind energy conversion system (WECS). A simple fuzzy controller method is applied to improve the overall performance of the WECS. The proposed method can retrieve the storing kinetic energy from the inertia of a wind turbine, perfectly. As a result, it can ensure a proficient power smoothing of the variable speed WECS. On the other hand, the grid side inverter is controlled by the fuzzy controller. This approach can reduce the fluctuation of DC link voltage and can deliver a smooth power to the power grid. The proposed method is compared with two other methods such as the maximum power point tracking control method and the without fuzzy controller method. A simple shunt circuit also includes in the DC link circuit. Therefore, during the system fault condition, the WECS can perform a stable operation. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In operation, wind turbine gearboxes (WTGs) are subjected to variable torsional and nontorsional loads. In addition, the manufacturing and assembly process of these devices results in uncertainty in the design parameters of the system. WTGs are reported to fail in their early life of operation within 3-7 years as opposed to the expected 20 years of operation. Their downtime and maintenance process is the most costly of the failures of any subassembly of wind turbines (WTs). The objective of this work is to perform a probabilistic multibody dynamic analysis (PMBDA) of the high-speed-parallel-helicalstage (HSPHS) of a WTG that considers the uncertainties of generator-side torque-loading and input-shaft speed as well as assembly and design parameter uncertainties. Component reliability (R-c) or probability of failure (P-f) and probabilistic sensitivities of all the input variables toward five performance functions have been measured and conclusions have been drawn. As opposed to the traditional deterministic approach, PMBDA has demonstrated a new aspect of design and installation of WTGs. In addition to revealing Rc or system reliability or underperformance through Pf, the method will also help designers to critically consider certain variables through the probabilistic sensitivity results.

AB This paper presents a new speed-sensorless control strategy for a stand-alone doubly-fed induction generator supplying energy to an isolated load. The method is based on the root mean square (rms) detection scheme. The generated stator voltage is controlled via rotor currents. Amplitude of stator voltage and its frequency are controlled simultaneously. The output signals from the voltage controllers are the reference signals for the rotor current amplitude and frequency of the stator voltage is regulated with the help of frequency control loop. This developed direct voltage control method is applicable for both the balanced and unbalanced load and also for standalone and grid connected mode. The control pulses for the rotor side converter is supplied by the hysteresis controller which is operated on the error signal calculated between actual and reference rotor currents. This paper also provides the brief idea about the voltage and frequency control on modern Autonomous DFIG based Wind Energy Systems via single phase mathematical model of standalone DFIG system. A short state-of-the-art review on mechanical position/speed sensorless control schemes for autonomous DFIG based WESs is presented, which helps the present researcher and students working in this area. These include stator flux oriented control techniques; direct voltage control techniques; MARS observer based techniques for autonomous DFIG-based variable-speed WESs. Simulation results obtained from a 2MVA DFIG system, prototype in MATLab/Simulink, are presented and discussed in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents survey about Fault Ride Through (FRT) techniques and controllers which employed with all wind generation system types. After presenting a comprehensive FRT survey, paper proposes three Fault Ride Through (FRT) controllers for keeping stability of Fixed Speed Wind Generation (FSWG) system serving in isolated Micro-Grid (MG). The first controller has been implemented by inserting Superconductor Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) in series with wind generator terminals during fault instant. The second proposed FRT controller is modifying the conventional Pitch Angle Controllers (PAC) to can spill and reduce high percentage of extracted mechanical wind power during and subsequent fault occurrence which in turns help stability improvement and restoration. Third FRT technique is performed by adapting the wind turbine gearbox ratio which forces the wind generation system to run far from the maximum power point. The best performance is obtained with the SFCL controller. Superior results are obtained when the three proposed FRT controllers are employed simultaneously. The three developed FRT controllers are simple, reliable and economical attractive.
   Effects of fault type on SFCL FRT controller performance are analyzed and investigated in details. The proposed SFCL FRT controller has been tested under single phase, double phase, phase to phase, and three phases to ground faults. Results display that the three phases to ground fault is the most severe type on SFCL FRT performance from stability point of view. On the other hand, double phase to ground fault is the most severe one from fluctuations and oscillations points of view. Parameters of the SFCL must be adjusted based on the three phases to ground fault If the SFCL FRT controller is designed to can deal with three phases fault, it sure can deal with the other fault types successfully.

AB An induction generator (IG) speed drive with the application of an optimal controller and a proposed General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) controller is introduced in this paper. Grid connected wind energy conversion system (WECS) present interesting control demands, due to the intrinsic nonlinear characteristic of wind mills and electric generators. The GRNN with adaptive ant colony optimization (AACO) torque compensation is feed-forward to increase the robustness of the wind driven induction generator system. An optimal control loop for the wind power system is designed. The optimality of the whole system is defined in relation with the trade-off between the wind energy conversion maximization and the minimization of the induction generator torque variation that is responsible for the frequency fluctuations. This is achieved by using a combined optimization criterion, resulting in a LQ tracking problem with an infinite horizon and a measurable exogenous variable (wind speed). The proposed controller is designed to drive the turbine speed to extract maximum power from the wind and adjust to the power regulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to increase the annual energy yield of a variable-speed wind energy conversion system (WECS), maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is required at below the rated wind speed. However, the only aspect that has been paid attention to by most of the researchers is the way to accelerate the MPPT speed. In fact, the research of this paper finds out that the faster the MPPT speed is, the larger transient load the turbine shaft bears. Thus, attempts are first made to find out the relationship between the MPPT speed and the transient load through quantity analysis. Then, a principle to choose a proper bandwidth of the MPPT system is given out to optimize the transient load. Furthermore, to ensure that the system can track the varying winds at the designed bandwidth, the design details on how to make the MPPT bandwidth constant are also proposed in this paper. Finally, a 1.2-kW variable-speed WECS, which is based on a permanent-magnet synchronous generator, is established in the laboratory. Theoretical analysis is verified by experimental results performed by it.

AB This paper proposes a methodology to improve the reliability of diagnosis of different types of faults in wound-rotor induction generators which work under variable load conditions, as in wind turbine applications; the method is based on the extraction of the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the fault-related components of stator and rotor currents during speed changes caused by nonstationary functioning. It is shown that, under these conditions, the IF versus slip plots of the fault components are straight lines with a specific slope and y-intercept for each kind of fault. In addition, neither of these patterns are dependent on the machine features or the way that the load changes. The practical methodology of this technique is introduced for diagnosing two different anomalies: stator winding asymmetry and rotor winding asymmetry. The approach is validated by laboratory tests for both types of faults in two different kinds of machines.

AB The efficiency of permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous machines with outer rotor and concentrated windings is investigated as a function of the mass of magnets used, keeping the power, volume, and mechanical air-gap thickness constant. In order to be useful for electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators, the efficiency is computed in wide speed and torque ranges, including overload. For a given type and amount of magnets, the geometry of the machine and the efficiency map are computed by analytical models and finite-element models, taken into account the iron loss, copper loss, magnet loss, and pulsewidth-modulation loss. The models are validated by experiments. Furthermore, the demagnetization risk and torque ripple are studied as functions of the mass of magnets in the machine. The effect of the mass of magnets is investigated for several soft magnetic materials, for several combinations of number of poles and number of stator slots, and for both rare earth (NdFeB) magnets and ferrite magnets. It is observed that the amount of PM material can vary in a wide range with a minor influence on the efficiency, torque density, and torque ripple and with a limited demagnetization risk.

ID DYNAMICS; DRIVE
AB An optimal control approach for a wind turbine drivetrain with a variable ratio gearbox is presented. The objective is to find the optimum shifting sequence of the variable ratio gearbox in order to maximize power generation and extend gear life. The employment of a variable ratio gearbox enhances the capabilities of the wind turbine to cope with wind speed variations. Based on the authors' preliminary study, the gear ratios of the variable ratio gearbox were carefully selected to maximize the wind energy capture. In this paper, a new control approach is proposed to achieve both extended gear service life and optimal energy harvesting. This new approach finds the gear shifting sequence that will minimize the tangential force on the gear tooth while maximizing the wind energy capture. The wind turbine drivetrain with a variable ratio gearbox is modeled and simulation results based on recorded wind data of different wind classes are presented and compared.

AB This paper is based on continuous measurements of voltages and currents from three wind farms for a period of 1 year, and the focus is on voltage dips. The purpose is to get an overview of the characteristics and rate of voltage dips, which occur in the wind farms and to study the wind turbine responses to voltage dips. In each of the wind farms there is one measurement point at a single wind turbine and one for measuring the contribution from the whole wind farm. Different wind turbine technologies are used in the three wind farms; fixed speed turbines with directly connected induction generators in wind farm 1 and variable speed turbines with power electronics converters and synchronous generators in wind farms 2 and 3. Voltage dips are evaluated according to the standard EN 50160, by considering the durations and residual voltages of the positive sequence component voltage dips. Some examples of voltage dip events with corresponding responses in active and reactive power are shown and discussed with a view to the different technologies.

AB This study proposes a maximum power tracking (MPT) controller based on chaos synchronisation (CS) for a wind-energy-conversion system. The output power conversion of a wind generator depends on the wind speed, and therefore the optimal conversion of wind energy can be obtained by a variable-speed variable-frequency model. Based on a sensorless controller, CS can express dynamic behaviours by using an incremental conductance to adjust the terminal voltage to the maximum power point. A voltage detector based on the Sprott system is used to track the desired voltage and to control the duty cycle of a boost converter. For a permanent-magnet synchronous generator, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPT controller.

ID ENERGY-STORAGE SYSTEM; BATTERY; ADALINE; TURBINE; SMES
AB Most wind turbine generators installed in large windfarms are of variable speed types operating at the maximum power point tracking mode to generate the maximum amount of power. Owing to this fact and regarding the random nature of the windspeed, the output power of the windfarm fluctuates. Fluctuating power is a serious problem for high capacity power plants and should be smoothed. As an effective factor on the required battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity value, tracking is the most important part performed by a coordinated control system in the power smoothing process. An ADAptive LInear NEuron (ADALINE)-based power tracking method with a flexible learning rate is proposed in this study. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimisation-based calculation of the learning rate is presented for optimising the proposed tracking method which reduces the required BESS capacity and the investment cost. Moreover, a charging/discharging algorithm for the BESS units is proposed which decreases the number of required BESS units and increases their useful life by reducing the switching activity as well. To evaluate the performance of the proposed coordinated control approach, the real output data of a 99 MW windfarm are tested. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

DT Article
ID VARIABLE-SPEED; TURBINES; RANGE
AB This study deals with the control of a low-power off-grid wind energy conversion system. As rotor blades are not pitchable, control is ensured by variable-speed operation in order to limit harvested power in high winds and to maximise it at low winds. Turbine power regulation is achieved through active speed stall control, which supposes operation at low rotational speed values. In this way, operation within admissible limits of rotational speed and torque is also ensured. A unique power controller is designed, with classical proportional-integral (PI) structure and switched parameters and references. An original solution for switching controller parameters so as to avoid local instability and preserve smooth transition between partial-load and full-load operating regimes is proposed. Switching is performed in an operating point where power controller output is sufficiently deep in saturation and the antiwindup structure is active. Guidelines for choosing this switching point are provided. This control structure does not require estimation of either wind speed or wind torque, or use of gain scheduling structures. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on a dedicated real-time simulator.

AB This paper presents a constant voltage operation of a Six-Phase Self-Excited Induction Generator (SPSEIG) driven by a fixed speed wind turbine using an Ant colony optimisation (ACO) technique to predict the behaviour of a the machine. In this paper, an attempt has been made to estimate the excitation capacitance requirements of a SPSEIG for maintaining rated terminal voltage and frequency. The range of capacitance variation required for maintaining constant terminal voltage while supplying a load of variable magnitude is evaluated. Analytical approaches, suitable for all the configurations of shunt capacitances such as variable excitation capacitance connected across (i) single three-phase winding set only and (ii) both the three-phase winding sets of an SPSEIG for operation as a simple shunt on no load and pure resistive load, are presented. The mathematical model developed is based on loop impedance method using graph theory. It is shown that the proposed technique is very effective and useful for making the SPSEIG feasible for remote areas with wind potential. The proposed approach is tested and compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Fmincon technique. (C) 2014 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When the turbine extracts power from the wind, a wake evolves downstream of the turbine. The turbines operating in the wake are not only subjected to a decreased wind speed but also increased dynamic loading arising from the increased turbulence induced by the upstream turbines. This increased turbulence must be accounted, when selecting a turbine. This increase in turbulence intensity can imply a significant reduction in the fatigue lifetime of wind turbines placed in wakes. For this reason, a large number of studies have been established concerning the calculation of wake added turbulence. Even though a number of mathematical functions have been proposed for modeling the wake added turbulence, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time. Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used as alternative to analytical approach as ANN offers advantages such as no required knowledge of internal system parameters, compact solution for multi-variable problems and fast calculation. In this investigation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which is a specific type of the ANN family, was used to predict the wake added turbulence. Neural network in ANFIS adjusts parameters of membership function in the fuzzy logic of the fuzzy inference system (FIS). This intelligent algorithm is implemented using Matlab/Simulink and the performances are investigated. The simulation results presented in this paper show the effectiveness of the developed method.

AB This paper studies the control of a variable-speed wind turbine using the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) driven by a wind turbine emulator. The wind turbine is realized by imposing the wind profile on emulator to behave as the real wind turbine when it receives the same wind profile. This wind turbine is connected to the grid by means of a two back-to-back voltage-fed pulse width-modulation (PWM) converters to interface the generator and the grid. This paper has three main objectives, the first is realization of the wind turbine emulator, the second is extracting and exploiting the maximum power from the wind, the third is feeding the grid by high-power and good electrical energy quality; to achieve that, we applied the strategies of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) using optimal torque control which allows the PMSG to operate at an optimal speed. The inverter is used for delivering power to the grid, controlled in a way to deliver only the active power into the grid, thus we have unit power factor. DC-link voltage is also controlled by the inverter. This paper shows the dynamic performances of the complete system by its simulation using Matlab Simulink. Experimental results has verified and validated the wind turbine emulator and the efficiency of MPPT control method using a variable wind profile. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The interest towards generic models or sometimes also called standard models of wind turbine generators (WTGs) is significantly increasing. Mainly due to their improved power quality, better controllability and higher power extraction capability, variable-speed wind turbines driving a synchronous or an induction machine are capturing the global market. Throughout this paper, dynamic modelling and performance analysis of the generic models of the variable-speed WTGs, namely the doubly-fed induction generator and the fully-rated converter based WTGs, are achieved using integration between Matlab/Simulink and PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platforms. Later on, the performance of type-4 wind turbine driving a permanent magnet synchronous machine is analysed during fault and then compared with the case when driving a wound rotor induction machine. The differences in control principles and dynamic fault behaviour are highlighted. Afterwards, investigations on wind farm level are accomplished. A case study during which the developed generic models and the generic model of the variable-speed machine are compared is conducted. Different arrangements for the construction of the generic wind farm are considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
