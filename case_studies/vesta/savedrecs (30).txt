AB Reactive power management is a critical issue when dealing with the planning and operation of power networks with high wind energy penetration. This paper is intended to introduce a coordinated Reactive Power Planning strategy among Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) variable speed wind turbines and Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices. According to this strategy, the reactive power capability from DFIG wind turbines is obtained and the limitations on deliverable power are deduced for each operation point. Furthermore, instead of using the reactive power limit as it is traditionally done, the reactive power injection from Static Var Compensator (SVC) is related to the existing physical limits of the control variables. The optimization strategy is based on genetic algorithms and includes directly in its formulation both the reactive power capability from wind turbines and the reactive power injection from SVC units. An existing 140-bus power system is used to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Enhancement of fault ride-through (FRT) capability and subsequent improvement of rotor speed stability of wind farms equipped with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is the objective of this paper. The objective is achieved by employing a novel FRT scheme with suitable control strategy. The proposed FRT scheme, which is connected between the rotor circuit and dc link capacitor in parallel with Rotor Side Converter, consists of an uncontrolled rectifier, two sets of IGBT switches, a diode and an inductor. In this scheme, the input mechanical energy of the wind turbine during grid fault is stored and utilized at the moment of fault clearance, instead of being dissipated in the resistors of the crowbar circuit as in the existing FRT schemes. Consequently, torque balance between the electrical and mechanical quantities is achieved and hence the rotor speed deviation and electromagnetic torque fluctuations are reduced. This results in reduced reactive power requirement and rapid reestablishment of terminal voltage on fault clearance. Furthermore, the stored electromagnetic energy in the inductor is transferred into the dc link capacitor on fault clearance and hence the grid side converter is relieved from charging the dc link capacitor, which is very crucial at this moment, and this converter can be utilized to its full capacity for rapid restoration of terminal voltage and normal operation of DFIG. Extensive simulation study carried Out employing PSCAD/EMTDC software vividly demonstrates the potential capabilities of the proposed scheme in enhancing the performance of DFIG based wind farms to fault ride-through.

AB The present popular trend of wind power generation is to use variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driving a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), wound field synchronous generator (WFSG) or permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). Among them, stability analyses of DFIG type of VSWT have already been reported in many literatures. However, transient stability and low voltage ride through (LVRT) characteristics analyses for synchronous generator type of VSWT is not sufficient enough. This paper focuses on detailed LVRT characteristic analysis of variable speed wind turbine driving a PMSG (VSWT-PMSG) with current controlled voltage source inverter (CC-VS!). Modeling and suitable control strategies for overall system are developed to augment the low voltage ride through capability of variable speed wind generator, considering recent wind farm grid code. Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults are analyzed as network disturbances in this paper. The permanent fault due to unsuccessful reclosing of circuit breakers is taken into consideration, which is a salient feature of this study. Moreover, the dynamic characteristic is analyzed using real wind speed data measured in Hokkaido Island, Japan. The proposed control scheme is simulated by using the standard power system simulation package PSCAD/EMTDC and results are verified by comparing that of voltage controlled voltage source inverter scheme available in power system literature.

AB The electrical energy production and reliability benefits of a wind energy conversion system (WECS) at a specific site depend on many factors, including the statistical characteristics of the site wind speed and the design characteristics of the wind turbine generator (WTG) itself, particularly the cut-in, rated and cut-out wind speed parameters. In general, the higher the degree of the wind site matching with a WECS is, the more are the energy and reliability benefits. An electrical energy production and reliability benefit index designated as the Equivalent Capacity Ratio (ECR) is introduced in this paper. This index can be used to indicate the electrical energy production, the annual equivalent utilization time and the credit of a WECS, and quantify the degree of wind site matching with a WECS. The equivalent capacity of a WECS is modeled as the expected value of the power output random variable with the probability density function of the site wind speed. The analytical formulation of the ECR is based on a mathematical derivation with high accuracy. Twelve WIG types and two test systems are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the ECR provides a useful index for a WTG to evaluate the energy production and the relative reliability performance in a power system, and can be used to assist in the determination of the optimal WIG type for a specific wind site.

AB In this paper, a buck-type power converter as the battery charger for the stand-alone wind power system is proposed. The proposed power converter can harvest the maximum power from the wind turbine while generating pulsating current for the battery bank to improve the charging efficiency. The maximum power point tracking function is realized by the constant on-time control, the circuit parameter design of the power converter, and the characteristics of wind turbine. The pulsating battery charging current is implemented by the discontinuous conduction mode operation of the proposed power converter. Also, the overspeed protection of the wind turbine can be naturally achieved when high power output occurs. Circuit simplicity and high reliability are the major advantages of the proposed power converter. Hardware experimental results from a 400-W prototype circuit are presented to verify the performance of the proposed power converter.

AB The rotational speed of a wind turbine is limited by the noise constraint of the blade tip speed. The larger the rotor diameter is, the smaller the rotor speed becomes. Therefore, there exists a transition region connecting the max-Cp operation with the power regulation operation. A conventional pitch schedule in this region involves using a fixed pitch. However, if the variable pitch instead of the fixed one is allowed, more electric power can be extracted from the wind. The benefit of using this strategy is analyzed from the point of how much the electric energy can be gained by applying the variable pitch schedule in this transition region.

ID SYSTEMS; UNCERTAINTY; DESIGN
AB High performance and reliability are required for wind turbines to be competitive within the energy market. To capture their nonlinear behavior, wind turbines are often modeled using parameter-varying models. In this paper we design and compare multiple linear parameter-varying (LPV) controllers, designed using a proposed method that allows the inclusion of both faults and uncertainties in the LPV controller design. We specifically consider a 4.8 MW, variable-speed, variable-pitch wind turbine model with a fault in the pitch system.
   We propose the design of a nominal controller (NC), handling the parameter variations along the nominal operating trajectory caused by nonlinear aerodynamics. To accommodate the fault in the pitch system, an active fault-tolerant controller (AFTC) and a passive fault-tolerant controller (PFTC) are designed. In addition to the nominal LPV controller, we also propose a robust controller (RC). This controller is able to take into account model uncertainties in the aerodynamic model.
   The controllers are based on output feedback and are scheduled on an estimated wind speed to manage the parameter-varying nature of the model. Furthermore, the AFTC relies on information from a fault diagnosis system.
   The optimization problems involved in designing the PFTC and RC are based on solving bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) instead of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) due to unmeasured parameter variations. Consequently, they are more difficult to solve. The paper presents a procedure, where the BMIs are rewritten into two necessary LMI conditions, which are solved using a two-step procedure.
   Simulation results show the performance of the LPV controllers to be superior to that of a reference controller designed based on classical principles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wind turbines operate in highly turbulent environments resulting in aerodynamic loads that can easily excite turbine structural modes, potentially causing component fatigue and failure. Two key technology drivers for turbine manufacturers are increasing turbine up time and reducing maintenance costs. Since the trend in wind turbine design is towards larger, more flexible turbines with lower frequency structural modes, manufacturers will want to develop control paradigms that properly account for the presence of these modes. Accurate models of the dynamic characteristics of new wind turbines are often not available due to the complexity and expense of the modeling task, making wind turbines ideally suited to adaptive control approaches. In this paper, we develop theory for adaptive control with rejection of disturbances in the presence of modes that inhibit the controller. A residual mode filter is introduced to accommodate these modes and restore important properties to the adaptively controlled plant. This theory is then applied to design an adaptive collective pitch controller for a high-fidelity simulation of a utility-scale, variable-speed wind turbine. The adaptive pitch controller is compared in simulations with a baseline classical proportional integrator (PI) collective pitch controller. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper aims to develop a novel pitch control system for a large wind turbine driven by a variable-speed pump-controlled hydraulic servo system. To perform practical pitch control experiments, a full-scale test rig of the hydraulic pitch control system for a 2 MW wind turbine's blade, including a novel pitch control mechanism, a variable-speed pump-controlled hydraulic servo system, a disturbance system and a PC-based control system, is designed and set up. The variable-speed pump-controlled hydraulic servo system, containing an AC servo motor, a constant displacement hydraulic piston pump two differential hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic circuits, achieved high response and high energy efficiency, so it is suitable for wind turbine applications. Besides, to implement the pitch control in the proposed novel pitch control system, an adaptive fuzzy controller with self-tuning fuzzy sliding-mode compensation (AFC-STFSMC) is developed to design the pitch controller. Finally, the developed variable-speed pump-controlled hydraulic servo system was built and verified for the path tracking control and path-positioning control of the pitch control of the wind turbines by practical experiments in a full-scale test rig under different path profiles, load torques, and random wind speeds.

AB The increasing power demand has led to the growth of new technologies that play an integral role in shaping the future energy market. Keeping in view of the environmental constraints, grid connected wind turbines are promising in increasing system reliability. This paper presents the impact of FACTS controllers on the stability of power systems connected with wind energy conversion systems. The wind generator model considered is a variable speed doubly fed induction generator model. The stability assessment is made first for a three phase short circuit without FACTS controllers in the power network and then with the FACTS controllers. The dynamic simulation results yield information on (i) the impact of faults on the performance of induction generators/wind turbines, (ii) transient rating of the FACTS controllers for enhancement of rotor speed stability of induction generators and angle stability of synchronous generators. EUROSTAG is used for executing the dynamic simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An ac/dc/ac power converter is an important device used to extract power from variable speed permanentmagnet wind generators and feed it into the grid. This paper describes how these converters incorporate maximum power point tracking based on its power feed to the grid at different wind speeds. Using the permanent magnet generator voltage, grid current, and grid voltage samples, the proposed system achieves an enhanced dynamic behavior. This feature effectively prevents the grid from "boost" charging the dc side of the H-bridge inverter at the start of operation. Since small wind turbines normally do not have expensive pitch control mechanisms, a thyristor-based "dump-load circuit" is employed to protect the turbine from high wind speed operation when disconnected from the grid. The thyristor controller also protects the inverter from high dc voltage input from the wind generator at high wind speed. Preliminary results are included using a laboratory 2-kW prototype converter.

AB In this paper, the design of a nonlinear rotor-side controller (RSC) is developed for a wind turbine generator based on nonlinear, H(2) optimal control theory. The objective is to demonstrate the synthesis of a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. In the case of a doubly fed induction generator, it is essential that the RSC and the MPPT algorithm are synthesized concurrently as the nonlinear perturbation dynamics about an operating point is either only just stable or unstable in most real generators. The algorithm is validated based on using nonlinear estimation techniques and maximizing an estimate of the actual power transferred from the turbine to the generator. The MPPT algorithm is successfully demonstrated both in the case when no disturbances were present, as it is a prerequisite for successful implementation, and in cases when significant levels of wind disturbances are present.

AB Cost-effective, predictive and proactive maintenance of wind turbines assumes more importance with the increasing number of installed wind farms in more remote location (offshore). A well-known method for assessing impeding problems is to use current sensors installed within the wind turbine generator. This paper describes then an approach based on the generator stator current data collection and attempts to highlight the use of the Hilbert transform for failure detection in a doubly-fed induction generator-based. Indeed, this generator is commonly used in modern variable-speed wind turbines. The proposed failure detection technique has been validated experimentally regarding bearing failures. Indeed, a large fraction of wind turbine downtime is due to hearing failures, particularly in the generator and gearbox. Copyright (C) 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

   Model Identification; Autoregressive Moving Average; Adaptive Control
AB Induction generators with double inputs have a high efficiency over a wide range of velocities caused by their capability of operation at variable speeds, so their application is increasing progressively. These generators along with wind turbines construct a suitable wind energy conversion system. Due to the intensive nonlinear and variant time characteristics of wind turbines and generators, there are some difficulties in conventional controlling methods. For this reason, usage of an adaptive controller is required. In the present paper, a predictive inverse neural model has been employed in order to control a wind system. In order to design this controller, input-output data set for wind energy conversion systems is required. In this paper, since real data for system were not available, modeling of the considered system has been performed. Afterward, two controlling structures including direct structure and adaptive scheme, which are based on multilayer neural networks, have been introduced for our modeled system. Furthermore, in order to study the ability of proposed controllers, several situations have been considered including the application of instant disturbance, the application of noise on the system as well as parameters variations and uncertainties of the system.

AB This paper deals with the analysis of power, generated by offshore wind farms, connected to a single large power converter (SLPC), operating at variable frequency (VF) or at constant frequency (CF). The results are compared with a scheme widely used in current onshore wind farms, consisting of multiple power converters (MPC), one for each wind turbine. A methodology to analyze different wind speed scenarios and an optimum electrical frequency search procedure is presented and applied to a case study. The advantage resulting from a wind farm containing only one power converter, with the associated cost, losses and maintenance reduction and reliability increase, is analyzed, taking into account both wind speed variability in wind farms and the number of wind turbines. The SLPC-VF scheme is also compared to a constant frequency scheme SLPC-CF, and it is shown that a significant power increase of more than 11% can be obtained with SLPC-VF. Finally, a multiple regression analysis is applied in order to get a mathematical expression which models this behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a torque and pitch control scheme for variable speed wind turbines with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). A torque controller is designed to maximize the power below the rated wind speed and a pitch controller is designed to regulate the output power above the rated wind speed. The controllers exploit the sliding mode control scheme considering the variation of wind speed. Since the aerodynamic torque and rotor acceleration are difficult to measure in practice, a finite time convergent observer is designed which estimates them. In order to verify the proposed control strategy, we present stability analysis as well as simulation results.

AB This paper describes a real-time hardware simulator for a grid-tied Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) wind power system, which consists of an anemometer, a data logger, a motor-generator set with vector drive, and a back-to-back power converter with a digital signal processor (DSP) controller. The anemometer measures real wind speed, and the data is sent to the data logger to calculate the turbine torque. The calculated torque is sent to the vector drive for the induction motor after it is scaled down to the rated simulator power. The motor generates the mechanical power for the PMSG, and the generated electrical power is connected to the grid through a back-to-back converter. The generator-side converter in a back-to-back converter operates in current control mode to track the maximum power point at the given wind speed. The grid-side converter operates to control the direct current link voltage and to correct the power factor. The developed simulator can be used to analyze various mechanical and electrical characteristics of a grid-tied PMSG wind power system. It can also be utilized to educate students or engineers on the operation of grid-tied PMSG wind power system.

AB The conventional means of assessing the performance of a wind turbine is through consideration of its power curve which provides the relationship between power output and measured wind speed. In this letter, it is shown how the joint probability distribution of power and wind speed can be learned from data, rather than from examination of the implied function of the two variables. Such an approach incorporates measures of uncertainty into performance estimates, allows inter-plant performance comparison, and could be used to simulate plant operation via sampling. A preliminary model is formulated and fitted to operational data as an illustration.

AB This paper presents a new switching strategy for electrolyzer used in hydrogen generation which is connected to the terminal of a wind farm. The output of wind generator, in general, fluctuates greatly due to the random wind speed variations, which has a serious influence on the power system operation. In this study, the wind farm is composed of variable speed wind turbines (VSWT) driving permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG). The hydrogen generator (HG) is composed of rectifier and 10 electrolyzer units where each unit is controlled by the chopper circuit. To smoothen the wind farm line power, at first, a reference for the line power is generated from the difference of exponential moving average of wind farm output and its standard deviation. Then the switching strategy is developed in such a way that the proposed cooperative system can smoothen the wind farm line power fluctuation as well as generating hydrogen gas absorbing the fluctuating portion of wind farm output that lies above the reference line power. This novel switching strategy helps each electrolyzer unit working in full load and shift operation conditions and hence increases its lifespan and efficiency. The performance of the proposed system is investigated by simulation analyses, in which simulations are performed by using PSCAD/EMTDC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyzes and compares different control tuning strategies for a variable speed wind energy conversion system (WECS) based on a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The aerodynamics of the wind turbine (WT) and a PMSG have been modeled. The control strategy used in this research is composed of three regulators, which may be based on either linear or nonlinear controllers. In this analysis, proportional-integral (PI) linear controllers have been used. Two different tuning strategies are analyzed and compared. The main goal is to enhance the overall performance by achieving a low sensitivity to disturbances and minimal overshoot under variable operating conditions. Finally, the results have been verified by an experimental WECS laboratory prototype. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a new voltage regulator of the DC-bus capacitor of a variable speed wind power generation system based on adaptive fuzzy system. The change in the fuzzy rule base is done using a variable-structure direct adaptive control algorithm to achieve the pre-defined control objectives. This algorithm has two merits. First, it has a good performance in the training phase as it makes use of the initial rule base defined for the fuzzy logic controller. Second, it has a robust estimator since it depends on variable structure technique. The adaptive nature of the new controller significantly reduces the rule base size and improves its performance.

AB This paper investigates the possibilities of viable power electronics converters, semiconductor switching devices and electric machines for 10 MW variable-speed wind turbine generators. The maximum rated power of existing wind turbine configurations is in the range of 6 MW. The proposed alternatives are compared against several technical and economical factors, and their advantages over the present wind turbines are highlighted. A comprehensive performance comparison of modern power semiconductor devices, their electrical characteristics and the key differentiators among them are presented. The power electronics converters considered include all commercially available multilevel voltage source and current source converters as well as the opportunities offered by power electronics building block-based design. The factors used for the comparison include the converter power range, capacitor voltage balancing, common mode voltage and current, electromagnetic interference emissions, fault ride-through capability, reliability, footprint, harmonic performance, efficiency and losses, component count, risk of torsional vibration by the harmonics and inter-harmonics, complexity, ease of back-to-back operation and filtering requirements. For the electric machines, this study concentrates on high-temperature superconducting machines, multi-phase induction machines and permanent magnet synchronous machines. These machines are compared against existing wind generator technologies in terms of their power range, torque density, efficiency, fault ride-through capability, reliability, footprint, harmonic performance, ease of fault detection, excitation control, noise and vibration signature, oscillation damping, gearbox requirement, cost and the size of the associated converter.

AB This paper deals with a new isolated wind-hydro hybrid generation system employing one squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) driven by a variable-speed wind turbine and another SCIG driven by a constant-power hydro turbine feeding three-phase four-wire local loads. The proposed system utilizes two back-to-back-connected pulsewidth modulation-controlled insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor-based voltage-source converters (VSCs) with a battery energy storage system at their dc link. The main objectives of the control algorithm for the VSCs are to achieve maximum power tracking (MPT) through rotor speed control of a wind-turbine-driven SCIG under varying wind speeds and control of the magnitude and the frequency of the load voltage. The proposed wind-hydro hybrid system has a capability of bidirectional active-and reactive-power flow, by which it controls the magnitude and the frequency of the load voltage. The proposed electromechanical system using SCIGs, an MPT controller, and a voltage and frequency controller are modeled and simulated in MATLAB using Simulink and Sim Power System set toolboxes, and different aspects of the proposed system are studied for various types of linear, nonlinear, and dynamic loads, and under varying wind-speed conditions. The performance of the proposed system is presented to demonstrate its capability of MPT, voltage and frequency control (VFC), harmonic elimination, and load balancing.

AB In this paper, a new predictive model that can forecast the performance of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is presented. The new model includes four primary variables (rotor velocity, wind velocity, air density, and turbine power output) as well as five geometrical variables (rotor radius, turbine height, turbine width, stator spacing, and stator angle). These variables are reduced to include the power coefficient (C(p)) and tip speed ratio (TSR). A power coefficient correlation for a novel VAWT (called a Zephyr Vertical axis Wind Turbine (ZVWT)) is developed. The turbine is an adaptation of the Savonius design. The new correlation can predict the turbine's performance for altered stator geometry and varying operating conditions. Numerical simulations with a rotating reference frame are used to predict the operating performance for various turbine geometries. The case study includes 16 different geometries for three different wind directions. The resulting 48 data points provide detailed insight into the turbine performance to develop a general correlation. The model was able to predict the power coefficient with changes in TSR, rotor length, stator spacing, and stator angle, to within 4.4% of the numerical prediction. Furthermore, the power coefficient was predicted with changes in rotor length, stator spacing, and stator angle, to within 3.0% of the numerical simulations. This correlation provides a useful new design tool for improving the ZVWT in the specific conditions and operating requirements specific to this type of wind turbine. Also, the new model can be extended to other conditions that include different VAWT designs. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Output power of wind turbine generator (WTG) is not constant and fluctuates due to wind speed changes. To reduce the adverse effects of the power system introducing WTGs, there are several published reports on output power control of WTGs detailing various researches based on pitch angle control, variable speed wind turbines, energy storage systems, and so on. In this context, this paper presents an integrated control method for a WF to reduce frequency deviations in a small power system. In this study, the WF achieves the frequency control with two control schemes: load estimation and short-term ahead wind speed prediction. For load estimation in the small power system, a minimal-order observer is used as disturbance observer. The estimated load is utilized to determine the output power command of the WF. To regulate the output power command of the WF according to wind speed changing, short-term ahead wind speed is predicted by using least-squares method. The predicted wind speed adjusts the output power command of the WF as a multiplying factor with fuzzy reasoning. By means of the proposed method, the WF can operate according to the wind and load conditions. In the WF system, each output power of the WTGs is controlled by regulating each pitch angle. For increasing acquisition power of the WF, a dispatch control method also is proposed. In the pitch angle control system of each WIG, generalized predictive control (GPC) is applied to enhance the control performance. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the numerical simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optimal reactive power dispatch of large-scale power systems with great amount of wind farms is one of the main issues in power systems operation. This paper focuses on the incorporation of reactive power capacity from Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) and from variable speed wind turbines in a coordinated reactive power dispatch. The reactive power capability of Double Fed Inductor Generator (DFIG) considers the capacity of the machine as well as the one of the grid side converter. The Optimization strategy is thus based on genetic algorithms (GA) and includes in its formulation the reactive power capability of DFIG and the reactive power injection of Static Var Compensators (SVC). The suitability of the proposed methodology is tested on a real 140-bus power system in order to determinate an optimal reschedule of the reactive power injection from different VAR sources minimizing, at the same time, the real power losses of the whole power system.

AB In this paper, a novel grid integration system for a variable-speed wind turbine using an interior permanent-magnet synchronous generator (IPMSG) is developed. The power conditioner system (PCS) consists of a series-type 12-pulse uncontrolled diode rectifier powered by a phase-shifting transformer and then cascaded to a pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) voltage source inverter. The active current of the grid-side PWM inverter is only controlled to follow the optimal active current reference which is determined by using a simple maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategy. The MPPT algorithm requires only three sensors in order to track the maximum power of the wind turbine. The most significant advantage of the proposed system is that the passive filter together with a series-type 12-pulse rectifier provides high efficiency by compensating the power factor angle of the IPMSG and suppresses distortions presented in the IPMSG voltages and currents. The laboratory results indicate that the proposed construction and scheme are simple, cheap, and efficient.

AB The paper presents a nonlinear approach, using a two-mass model and a wind speed estimator, for variable-speed wind turbine (WT) control. The use of a two-mass model is motivated by the need to deal with flexible modes induced by the low-speed shaft stiffness. The main objective of the proposed controllers is the wind power capture optimization while limiting transient loads on the drive-train components. This paper starts by an adaptation of some existing control strategies. However, their performance are weak, as the dynamics aspects of the wind and aeroturbine are not taken into consideration. In order to bring some improvements, nonlinear static and dynamic state feedback controllers, with a wind speed estimator, are then proposed. Concerning the wind speed estimator, the idea behind this is to exploit the WT dynamics by itself as a measurement device. All these methods have been first tested and validated using an aeroelastic WT simulator. A comparative study between the proposed controllers is performed. The results show better performance for the nonlinear dynamic controller with estimator in comparison with the adapted existing methods.

AB This paper studies the validity of the standard method in IEC 61400-21 for assessing the flicker emission from multiple wind turbines. The standard method is based on testing a single wind turbine and then using the results of this test to assess the flicker emission from a number of wind turbines. This study is based on the data from two wind farms, one with fixed-speed wind turbines and one with variable-speed wind turbines. The data are: a type test at the terminals of a wind turbine, and measurements at the connection of a collection line to the substation. The type test data are used to assess the flicker emission at the collection line; this assessment is then compared to the actual measurements in order to study the accuracy of the estimation. It was observed in both wind farms, that the assessment based on the standard method is statistically conservative compared to the measurements. The reason for this is the statistical characteristics of flicker emission.

ID FED INDUCTION GENERATOR; SMALL-SIGNAL STABILITY; TURBINE
AB A multivariable control strategy based on model predictive control techniques for the control of variable-speed variable pitch wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) in the above-rated wind speed zone is proposed. Pitch angle and generator torque are controlled simultaneously to provide optimal regulation of the generated power and the generator speed while minimising torsional torque fluctuations in the drive train and pitch actuator activity. This has the effect of improving the power quality of the electrical power generated by the WECS and increasing the life time of the mechanical parts of the system. Furthermore, safe and acceptable operation of the system is guaranteed by incorporating most of the constraints on the physical variables of the WECS in the controller design. In order to cope with the non-linearity in the WECS and the continuous variation in the operating point, a multiple model predictive controller is suggested to provide near optimal performance within the whole operating region.

AB Variable-speed wind turbines are able to adapt to low wind speeds and therefore have greater efficiency than fixed-speed turbines during partial-load operation. Unfortunately, the high cost and low reliability of the electronics that enable variation in speed have discouraged this mode of operation for distributed wind turbines. Alternatively, a Variable-Ratio Gearbox (VRG) can be integrated into the fixed-speed wind turbine to facilitate operation with a discrete set of variable speeds that boost efficiency. The VRG concept is based upon mature technology taken from the automotive industry and is characterized by low cost and high reliability. In this paper, a model-based design methodology is introduced to study the performance gain of integrating a VRG into a fixed-speed stall-regulated wind turbine system. The results demonstrate how this device can improve the efficiency of the fixed-speed turbine in the partial-load region and the potential to use the VRG to limit power in the full-load region where pitch control is often used.

AB Research on effects of wind turbines on bats has increased dramatically in recent years because of significant numbers of bats killed by rotating wind turbine blades. Whereas most research has focused on the Midwest and inland portions of eastern North America, bat activity and migration on the Atlantic Coast has largely been unexamined. We used three long-term acoustic monitoring stations to determine seasonal bat activity patterns on the Assateague Island National Seashore, a barrier island off the coast of Maryland, from 2005 to 2006. We recorded five species, including eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Seasonal bat activity (number of bat passes recorded) followed a cosine function and gradually increased beginning in April, peaked in August, and declined gradually until cessation in December. Based on autoregressive models, inter-night bat activity was autocorrelated for lags of seven nights or fewer but varied among acoustic monitoring stations. Higher nightly temperatures and lower wind speeds positively affected bat activity. When autoregressive model predictions were fitted to the observed nightly bat pass totals, model residuals > 2 standard deviations from the mean existed only during migration periods, indicating that periodic increases in bat activity could not be accounted for by seasonal trends and weather variables alone. Rather, the additional bat passes were attributable to migrating bats. We conclude that bats, specifically eastern red, hoary, and silver-haired bats, use this barrier island during migration and that this phenomenon may have implications for the development of near and offshore wind energy.

DE Wind pumping; Efficiency assessment; Wind generator
AB The combined efficiency of the components determines overall system performance in electric wind pumping systems. We evaluated a system composed of a 3 kW wind generator feeding a battery bank of 48 V/880 Ah by means of a non-controlled 6-pulse rectifier. Connected to this battery bank was a 1.5 kW inverter that generated 220 V at 50 Hz, which powers a 1.1 kW single-phase electric pump. At the University of Concepcion, Chile, energy losses in each electrical component was determined using a data collection system configured to measure electrical variables in real time. The electrical power generated by the wind generator for different wind speeds averaged 38% lower than the power curve provided by the manufacturer. Electromechanical tests performed in a lab showed the operation efficiency of the electric generator of the wind turbine averaged 80%. This information, along with the electrical power output, and the wind velocity measured during field operation allowed us to determine the rotor's power coefficient C(p), which had a maximum value of 35%. For the stored energy components measured data indicated that the rectifier, the battery bank, and the inverter operated with average efficiencies of 95%, 78% and 86% respectively. The combined component efficiencies showed a maximum of 17% of the wind energy would be available for water pumping. Since a large amount of wind energy was dissipated during the energy conversion process, new configurations should be analyzed that could avoid such losses in wind pumping systems.

AB This paper presents the design of an on-line training recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) controller with a high-performance model reference adaptive system (MRAS) observer for the sensorless control of a induction generator (IG). The modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is adopted in this study to adapt the learning rates in the back-propagation process of the RFNN to improve the learning capability. By using the proposed RFNN controller with MPSO, the IG system can work for stand-alone power application effectively. The proposed output maximization control is achieved without mechanical sensors such as the wind speed or position sensor, and the new control system will deliver maximum electric power with light weight, high efficiency, and high reliability. The estimation of the rotor speed is based on the MRAS control theory. A sensorless vector-control strategy for an IG operating in a grid-connected variable speed wind energy conversion system can be achieved. 0 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the interannual variability of wind speed a feasibility analysis for the installation of a Wind Energy Conversion System at a particular site requires estimation of the long-term mean wind turbine energy output. A method is proposed in this paper which, based on probabilistic Bayesian networks (BNs), enables estimation of the long-term mean wind speed histogram for a site where few measurements of the wind resource are available. For this purpose, the proposed method allows the use of multiple reference stations with a long history of wind speed and wind direction measurements. That is to say, the model that is proposed in this paper is able to involve and make use of regional information about the wind resource. With the estimated long-term wind speed histogram and the power curve of a wind turbine it is possible to use the method of bins to determine the long-term mean energy output for that wind turbine. The intelligent system employed, the knowledgebase of which is a joint probability function of all the model variables, uses efficient calculation techniques for conditional probabilities to perform the reasoning. This enables automatic model learning and inference to be performed efficiently based on the available evidence. The proposed model is applied in this paper to wind speeds and wind directions recorded at four weather stations located in the Canary Islands (Spain). Ten years of mean hourly wind speed and direction data are available for these stations. One of the conclusions reached is that the BN with three reference stations gave fewer errors between the real and estimated long-term mean wind turbine energy output than when using two measure-correlate-predict algorithms which were evaluated and which use a linear regression between the candidate station and one reference station.

DE Wind system; synchronous generator; conical rotor
AB This paper presents a method to control power of a synchronous generator driven by a powerful variable speed wind turbine. The generator rotor has a conical shape and allows the air-gap variation through the lateral movement of the rotor subassembly, using a worm gear. In operation, the generator is not disconnected from the electrical grid, even at high wind speeds as the automatic increase of air-gap limits the power of generator. There is however a mechanical limitation of generator speed at high wind speeds at which the mechanical resistance of the system would be in danger. Conical-rotor synchronous generator has the advantage that automatically limits its power regardless of wind speed and is no longer necessary a limitation resistance to do that. By lowering the excitation current the generator current will be limited below its nominal value. Construction of the conical rotor lead to some complications of manufacturing process and mechanical assembly of magnetic cores of the generator to allow controlled longitudinal movement of the rotor during operation. These complications were solved and currently are constructed conical rotor motors used for electric braking [1].

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB The uncertain and random characteristics of wind energy make the problem of wind turbine control interesting and challenging. This work investigates an adaptive method for variable speed control of wind turbines under varying operation conditions. For fixed-speed operation of wind turbines, maximum power conversion can be achieved only at a particular wind speed, thus variable speed control of wind turbines is of practical interest in enhancing wind turbine operating efficiency over wide wind speeds. Based on the nonlinear dynamic model of wind turbine, adaptive algorithms are developed in accommodating unknown system parameter uncertainties. This method is shown to be able to achieve smooth and effective tracking of rotor angular speed to capture maximum wind energy. The effectiveness and adaptation of the proposed approach is validated via numerical simulation.

DE "PMSG"; "DC Link Voltage"; "IGBT"; "Modulation Index"; "PWM"
AB The variable speed wind turbine with a multi-pole Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and Fully Rated Converter (FRC) is a popular choice for modern megawatt scale wind turbines. Two back to back 2-level pulse width modulated (PWM) voltage source converters are typically used for the FRCs. The two converters are interconnected through the dc link capacitors. The power converters are based on multi-chip IGBT modules. One way of increasing the inherent reliability of the FRC is to reduce the operating electrical and thermal stresses on these IGBT modules. A higher dc link voltage leads to high IGBT stresses. Higher dc link voltage is also a major contributor to cosmic ray induced failures. In the existing FRCs in wind turbine systems, the dc link voltage is maintained at a fixed value while the modulation indices of the two converters are varied. The investigation presented in this paper and authors' previous work shows that this fixed dc link voltage is significantly higher than the minimum dc link voltage required at the majority of the operating conditions in the maximum power point tracking range. In the case study based on a multi-megawatt wind turbine, for generator speeds up to about 85% of the rated speed, the dc link voltage can be lowered to match the ac system voltage by setting the modulation index of the network bridge converter to the maximum value while the modulation index of the generator bridge is varied to match the generator voltage. Above this speed, the generator bridge converter dominates at certain network conditions where its modulation index needs to be at maximum while network bridge modulation index is varied to match the network voltage. Simulation results show successful operation of the system with minimum dc link voltages at steady state. A study on cosmic ray induced failure rate calculations shows higher reliability may be achieved when the FRC is operated with a variable dc link voltage optimised to minimum values.

AB The power of offshore wind turbines are expected to increase to 10 MW and more in the future. This will make today's technology unsuitable due to increased nacelle weight. Therefore, this work focus on a new modular converter solution, which designed specifically to a generator results in reduced nacelle weight. Additional benefits are redundancy and modularity in the converter.

AB Wind energy has been regarded as an environmentally friendly, logistically feasible and economically responsible alternative energy resource. In order to produce as much power as possible in variable speed wind turbine generators, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) becomes a hotspot of research in this field. In this paper, a simple control method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in a variable speed wind turbine by using a boost converter without mechanical sensors is proposed. A climbing algorithm is used to achieve MPPT. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed technique.

ID RELIABILITY
AB This paper presents a real-time prognosis technique to estimate the life consumption in power modules in a variable-speed wind turbine generator. This approach is used to evaluate the expected life of power electronic modules for a range of drive control strategies in a doubly fed induction (DFIG) generator which is fitted in a variable speed wind turbine including Maximum Power Tracking (MPT), Constant Power Mode (CPM) and Constant Torque Mode (CTM). Using real-time compact thermal models which are integrated with life time models for two common wear-out mechanisms (wire bond and solder substrate) made it useful to estimate the life consumption of power modules in use. The impact of Maximum Power Tracking, Constant Power Mode and Constant Torque Mode control schemes on the life of power module bond wires and solder layers is demonstrated. The results showed that using MPT control method can affect badly the expected life of power modules simply because it generates more thermal cycling. On the other hand, both the CPM and the CTM have less impact on the life of the power modules used in DFIG converters.

In this new control scheme, a small series dynamic braking resistor (SDBR) is used in the stator circuit of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) along with DC-chopper braking resistor. Simulation results show the advantages of the combined control strategy for the resumption of normal operation efficiently, with shortened possible operating time during grid fault in the multi-machine power system that connects wind farm.

AB This paper presents an approach that mitigates the flicker in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine systems. The reactive power is controlled to compensate for the flicker from the grid-side converter (GSC). However, it is not sufficient to eliminate the flicker fully in the case of the low grid impedance ratio and the limited capacity of converters. So, a method using an energy storage system (ESS) for the output power smoothening is combined with the reactive power control to reduce the flicker. The PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for a 2[MW] DFIG wind turbine system.
