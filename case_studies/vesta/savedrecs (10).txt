AB In wind turbines the power generation (power capture) and output torque depends on wind speed. Due to the rapid variations in wind speed, wind and inflow angle evaluating the output power becomes a challenging problem. Many optimization control techniques seek to extract the output power continuously. This paper focusses on dynamic analysis and control of variable wind turbine's rotor yaw angle and angular deflection. Earlier work used wind direction and pitch angle to control the performance of wind turbine. Using rotor yaw and angular deflection control of horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines is relatively new. For dynamic analysis, rotor yaw and rotor angular deflection, model techniques and experimental setup mechanisms were done in detail. Simulations were carried out in C++ to program an Arduino microcontroller and motor driver. Matlab software was used to interface wind turbine experimental setup, Arduino microcontroller and show the functions and aerodynamic forces. The result shows that the performance of wind turbine with this technique gives better result by increasing the power capture by about 15% more.

AB In recent years wind energy is becoming more popular among other renewable sources due to more advanced technologies. Reduction in the cost of wind energy requires more efficient technology which is able to extract optimum power form the wind. The main focus of this work is to design a new adaptive controller for a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) for maximizing turbine's energy capture. The generator torque is considered as the control input and it depends on the optimal rotor speed which is derived from the effective wind speed. From aerodynamic torque and rotor speed the effective wind speed is derived by Modified Newton Rapshon (MNR). Initially the conventional sliding mode controller (SMC) is considered. The control performance of SMC is compared with proposed Adaptive Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Mode Control (ANTSMC) for different level of random disturbances and actuator offset. The main advantage of ANTSMC is robustness to input disturbances and parametric uncertainties of the turbine. Both the controllers are tested for a single mass mathematical wind turbine (WT) model and validated through different mean wind speed with various random disturbances and actuator offset. Validation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of better energy capture and robustness to disturbances.

AB This paper addresses the problem of alleviating tower stresses for wind turbines in the event of extreme loads during the transition between the partial and full load operation regions. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) is used to enhance power capture for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5MW variable-pitch variable-speed reference wind turbine. It is assumed that wind field preview information is measurable using wind speed/direction measurement devices such as LIDAR. The objective is to mitigate extreme loads on the turbine structure by minimizing the tower-top movement caused by thrust forces. While conventional controllers aim to extract maximal power from the wind by tracking the maximum power coefficient c(P,max) for below-rated wind speeds, the proposed NMPC approach additionally damps the tower fore-aft movement in response to sudden changes in the wind speed. This results in considerable load mitigation. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on various control strategies for permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) systems, in order to stabilize the dc link output voltage over a wide operation speed range.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two control methods, namely, the flux regulation control (FRC) which adjusts the stator flux linkage and then indirectly stabilize the dc link voltage, and the direct voltage control (DVC) which directly stabilize the dc link voltage by regulating the power angle, are proposed in this paper. Both methods can be realized by either approach of the conventional space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) or the proposed single voltage vector modulation (SVVM).
   Findings - The FRC can optimize the field in the PMSG, however, the realization is complicated. The DVC need not estimate and regulate the stator flux linkage, hence is easy to implement. On the other hand, the SVPWM can provide smooth armature current and dc link voltage, while the SVVM applies only one voltage vector during each control cycle, hence, is simple to realize and requires the minimum switching on the PWM rectifier. All cross-combinations between the two control methods and the two realization approaches work well.
   Originality/value - The proposed FRC and DVC methods are simpler than the conventional field oriented control, while the proposed SVVM is a novel and efficient approach to generate the PWM status. Optimal cross-combination, either of SVPWM-FRC, SVVM-FRC, SVPWM-DVC and SVVM-DVC, can be chosen to satisfy the system characters and requirements.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new nonlinear control algorithm to control a wind turbine based on permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to the grid via a back-to-back converter. The control algorithm is composed of a flatness-based method for the machine side convertor (MSC) and a voltage-oriented method for the grid side converter (GSC).
   Design/methodology/approach - For the MSC control, the output variable is chosen properly to prove that the system is flat at first. Then, the appropriate reference trajectories are planned on its components. The reference trajectories are such designed that the system operates in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. Finally, state feedback regulators are used to force the system output to follow its reference. To control the GSC, a classical voltage-oriented control method is used.
   Findings - The simulation results obtained with a random wind speed are presented in order to prove the validity of the proposed control algorithm. These results show that the system is controlled successfully while it operates in the MPPT mode or in its maximum power limitation mode.
   Originality/value - In this paper, a new algorithm based on flatness property is presented to control a variable speed wind turbine based on a PMSG. The proposed control method allows the system to operate in optimal operating modes.

AB The aim of this paper is hybrid fuzzy sliding mode control of a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) in the form of a wind turbine. This type of control is introduced to avoid the major disadvantage of variable structure systems, namely the chattering phenomenon. Variable structure ensures the high dynamic of convergence and robustness towards parametric variations and disturbances. Fuzzy control is introduced here in order to remove residual vibrations in high frequencies. That approach is used to control the mechanical speed and the reactive power exchanged between the stator circuit and the grid. Those variables are decoupled through vector control. The feasibility of this work is proven by mathematical and simulation models based on MATLAB.

AB This paper presents control schema of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) system with two controllers for generator side and grid side converters in a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) application. In generator side converter, the most efficient algorithms designed to track the maximum power point (MPP) for catching the maximum wind power is reviewed. For this approach we then design a new maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm using the Variable Structure Automatic Systems approach (VSAS). The proposed approach leads efficient algorithms as shown in this paper by the analysis and simulations. The obtained results show clearly the superiority of the Modified Enhanced Perturb and Observe (MEPO) technique. Using this MPPT method the generated power by the turbine is considered to be, in terms of power control, an auxiliary source feeding a grid. In the grid side converter, active and reactive power control has been achieved by controlling d-axis and q-axis grid current components respectively. The simulation results show the efficiency and reliability of the control strategy proposed in this paper. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since wind turbines became one of the most often source of renewable energy, appropriate health and condition monitoring systems are required. Especially proper monitoring of offshore plants is very significant because the accessibility is difficult and inspections are very costly. In comparison with conventional rotating machine vibration monitoring, where steady conditions and stationary signal are usually assumed, the wind turbines are characterized by unsteady conditions due to variable rotational speed. Hence the vibration signal is non-stationary and interpretation of signal signatures may be more complex. The common approach to analyze such non-stationary signals is the use of a time-frequency method, usually Short-Time Fourier Transform, which is the most popular one due to its simplicity. Nevertheless, there are other methods which can give a different view at the analyzed data and provide new information. This article investigates the potential use of some other time-frequency methods, namely Wavelet Transform, Wigner-Ville distribution and Hilbert-Huang transform in wind plants monitoring systems and apply these methods to real measured data with additional simulated bearing fault signal. Finally, the mentioned methods are compared based on computational complexity, readability and interpretability. Though the last two criteria are very subjective, Short-Time Fourier Transform was finally chosen as the most effective method followed by Wavelet Transform.

AB The aim of this paper is to obtain the energy stored in the electric accumulators (EA), for a wind system operating at a time-variable wind speed. Mechanical energy captured by the wind turbine (VT) is converted into electric energy by permanent magnet synchronous generator, PMSG. The synchronous generator provides energy into an electric accumulator, by using a rectifier, in two ways: uncontrolled rectifier and controlled rectifier and adjusted load. The simulations performed in this paper can highlight the differences between the two situations.

AB This paper presents a control method for a wind turbine with a synchronous generator with permanent magnet (SGPM), to achieve optimal function in the optimal energy field at variable wind speed. The wind speed and the angular speed of the SGPM impose the value of the generator load in the optimal energy area. Based on energy balances, done with speed and power measurements, the generator load is determined so that the system can be brought into the optimal energy area. The operation at maximum power of a wind turbine (WT) is analyzed by modifying the generators load, under the terms of a significant wind speed variation in time. The coordinates of the maximum power point (MPP) change in time being determined by the instantaneous values of the wind speed and the mechanical inertia, not in every case the wind turbine can be brought, in a timely manner, in the MPP area. The rapidity of the wind speed variation in time as well as the inertial value, are two fundamental elements upon which the operation in MPP depends. Prescribing the value of the DC current, Icc, from the intermediate converter circuit, a simple and useful control of the wind turbine system can be achieved. The control method that allows the WT to function in the optimal energy area is based on knowing the value of Icc, which is determinate from wind speed and the angular mechanical velocity (AMV).

AB today, variable speed pumped storage (VSPS) system is an emerging technique, being used in hydro powered plants to increase the efficiency, quality and control of the power of the grid. The doubly fed induction machine (DFIM) based VSPS systems are gaining more importance because of the cheap price of the converter i.e. back to back power electronics converter. This paper discuses an efficient method for the rotor side converter (RSC) to control the active and reactive power flowing through the stator of DFIM while the grid side converter (GSC) has been used to maintain the DC voltage level. This paper also discusses the VSPS systems Worldwide and its comparison with hydro powered projects which are recently developed in Pakistan. This paper suggests the use of VSPS systems in Pakistan to increase the efficiency of the conventional hydro power projects.

AB In this paper, the effect of wind power generation on power system reliability is investigated. Furthermore, reliability improvement of power system using integrated battery energy storage system and wind farm will be evaluated. Growing demand for electrical energy, gradual diminishing of fossil fuel resources and environmental pollution due to continuous exploitation of them, have led to inevitable change of energy sources in power generation. Due to the random nature of wind speed, the power output of a wind farm is fluctuating; as a result, it does not have a proper control capability. The growing penetration of wind power generation in power system could cause various problems in different areas such as power quality, system stability and reliability. Utilizing Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is a solution to overcome the variable nature of wind turbine generation.

AB In many SHM applications, a statistical framework for the distinction between damaged and normal states is often desirable. Usually, conventional methods which employ such statistical tests aim at the identification of abnormal, or extreme, data points when compared to a model of normality. This comparison is mainly done piecewise on individual points in a univariate case, or on datasets, if multivariate features are available. The latter case commonly involves the fusion of the multivariate feature into a scalar variable which is then individually assessed, again in a statistical framework. Depending on the actual application, this approach may be limited, or prone to false identifications. A new theory, previously proposed by researchers at Oxford University and applied for novelty detection, attempts to identify functions instead of just datasets, which are then assessed in terms of their novelty. The extreme function theory develops a normal model of the structure based on functions which can be acquired from different sources of data, and thus account for a more robust damage detection. This paper presents the extreme function theory as an approach to SHM. A case study of monitoring wind turbines with the help of power curves i.e. models which relate the wind speed to the power produced, is presented. The data used in the study originate from a real wind farm.

AB The pitch control strategy of the wind generator set in the paper applies power feedback closed loop control to implement that variable-speed constant-frequency wind turbine regulates constant power removal by adjusting pitch angle under the condition above the rated speed. The present output power of the generator is measured by power acquisition, and the power deviation is calculated out by comparing with the given power (the rated power of the generator). And the power variance is the input of the power controller. The controller sends the order of blade referring to pitch angle according to power variance, and the pitch-regulated mechanism adjusts the blade of the fan according to the pitch angle. The actual wind power generation system is a multivariable, nonlinear, strong coupling and time-varying complicated system, and it is difficult to establish the accurate mathematical model. So traditional PID algorithm is difficult to be qualified for the power controller of large high-performance wind generator set. The research indicates that parameter self-tuning PID controller based on fuzzy logic not only can solve the problem of linear control, but also adapts to nonlinear system [31]. Based on the basic rues of pitch control, the paper proposes a design scheme of fuzzy PID power controller, and simulates the wind generator set of fuzzy PID power controller.

AB In this paper, the transient and steady-state performances of an isolated self-excited induction generator driven by a wind turbine and feeding power to a dynamic load such as a three-phase induction motor are analyzed. Mathematical modeling and simulation study of the whole system, including the wind turbine, induction generator, capacitor, pulse width modulated voltage source inverter, and dynamic load, are carried out with closed-loop voltage and frequency controller. The complete system is modeled in the stationary d-q frame and validated by comparing simulation and experimental results at no-load. The same mathematical model is then used to study the transient performance of the self-excited induction generator supplying to a dynamic load. When the induction motor is connected to the induction generator without any voltage and frequency controller, it causes severe transients in electrical and mechanical variables of the generator. Due to the large starting-current requirement of the induction motor, there is a collapse of the terminal voltage of the generator. A bidirectional pulse width modulated source inverter with DC link battery is connected with the generator and operated in closed-loop control mode to maintain voltage and frequency and to operate the induction motor successfully with variable wind speed and mechanical load.

The objective is to independently control the active and reactive power generated by the DFIG, which is decoupled by the orientation of the flux. The sliding mode control finds its strongest justification for the problem concerning the use of a robust nonlinear control law for the model uncertainties. As far as the fuzzy mode control is concerned, it aims at reducing the chattering effect. The obtained results show the increasing interest of such control in this system

ID LOAD REDUCTION; SYSTEMS
AB For a variable-speed wind turbine (VSWT), the primary objective of control is to maximize power generation while maintaining the desired rotor speed and avoiding equipment overloads. To fulfill the control objectives, the classical model-based control (MBC) has been widely used, which refers to two controllers: torque controller (TC) and pitch controller (PC). In this work, the drawbacks of MBC for VSWTs are studied extensively. It reveals that there are transition issues between the TC and PC, and over-speed problems under large turbulent wind when only MBC is taken. To improve the control performance of the VSWT, an integrated control solution is presented, in which three fuzzy logic control modules are designed to function in parallel with MBC modules. Potential integrated structures are also given and a structure suitable for industrial application is adopted in this study. The proposed solution is applied to update the raw control system of a 3.0 MW VSWT of the Chinese Ming Yang Wind Power, which is validated with nonlinear simulations by using the commercial wind turbine simulation tool Bladed in accordance with IEC standards. The results prove that good performance of the target wind turbine is guaranteed under the proposed integrated control structure.

AB Power interruption is the major problem in many sectors, to overcome this issue Uninterruptible Power Supply is used. During emergency situation it is a reliable source. During backup time batteries are more efficient when supplied to low load. In case of connecting to heavy load, Pulsated power is extracted. This greatly reduces the lifetime of the battery and alters the battery cycle due to frequent charging and discharging. To overcome this issue ultra capacitors are used. The proposed method has a variable speed wind turbine using a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), integrated with the grid system. This combination will be reducing the wind turbine fluctuation and voltage variation. The design is simulated by using MATLAB Simulink. Results show that this method efficiently eliminates the battery stress and improve the power quality.

AB This paper presents maximization of social welfare in a wind thermal coordinated, deregulated wholesale power market using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. As the real power demand is always variable in nature, power generators can be rescheduled to meet the demand with the objective of maximizing the social welfare. In the proposed approach, wind turbine speeds are generated for various values of demand and the generators are rescheduled accordingly with the objective of maximization of social welfare using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed method is tested on Modified WSCC-9 bus system, where one of the generators is treated as thermal unit while the other two generators are wind power generators. Simulations are done with MATLAB 10.0 version.

DT Article; Book Chapter
ID SEA
AB The possible effects of a wind farm on the atmosphere, especially on the atmospheric wind field, are summarized in the previous chapter. Based on the fact that wind farms will be heightened construct on the ocean, an analysis on how a changed wind field will affect the ocean's dynamics is of special interest in this context. At this juncture, different aspects are focused on.
   Foremost, a common description of the impact on the ocean is given in subitem Sect. 5.1, introducing provoked changes in ocean dynamics and hydrography. Furthermore, a physical analysis explains and derives occurring changes in Sect. 5.2. Section 5.3 refers to different METRAS simulations for different wind speeds, amount of wind turbines, consistency of effect, and investigations regarding computational assumptions of ocean simulations, like forcing, depth of model area, and horizontal resolution, to fully capture all sides of the appearing phenomenon. Although HAMSOM is well verified over the years, the results are compared to measurements in Sect. 5.4 to estimate the dimension of OWFs' impact on the ocean and to evaluate the model data.
   The main variables that are analyzed here are hydrodynamic and hydrological properties. Simulations are based on TOS-01 (box model, Sect. 3.3) with a mostly adopted geostrophic flow of 8 m/s; otherwise, then it is explicitly alluded to.
   To point out the OWF effect on the ocean, the results are primarily presented by differences between a run with operating wind farm (OWFr) and a run without wind farm, the reference run (REFr). This dodge reflects the clear effect of OWFs because all changes in the dynamics do not occur in REFr.

AB The integration of large-scale Variable-Speed Wind Turbine Generators (VSWTGs) will challenge power systems frequency stability due to the lack of inertia response and reserve capacity in their control system, which are important for power system stability and power quality. This paper deduced quantitatively power systems frequency regulation indexes considering high penetration wind power integration, including Rate Of Change Of Frqeuncy (ROCOF), Maximum Frequency Deviation (MFD), and Steady State Frequency Deviation(SSFD). Then the dominant parameters effect on frequency stability were analyzed. The improvement on frequency stability with wind plants participating in Inertia Response (IR) and Primary Frequency Regulation (PFR) services was analyzed with the choice basis for wind plants ancillary frequency regulation controller parameters provided. Finally, a regional power grid was used to verify the the oreitcal analyses, and the results indicated that wind plants with frequency regulation services can improve power systems frequency stability and power quality.

AB This paper presents a novel optimal H-infinity tracking-based adaptive fuzzy neural network controller (HAFNNC) for a variable speed wind turbine. The main objective of the controller is to optimise the energy captured from the wind. In the presence of large uncertainties, H-infinity control approach produces oscillatory phenomenon due to the higher needed gain. In order to reduce this gain, fuzzy neural network (FNN) with online adaptation of the parameters is used to estimate the uncertain parts of the system plant and hence enable a lower gain to be used. To eliminate the trade-offs between the H-infinity tracking performance and the high gain at the control input, we have introduced a new method based on the modification of the output tracking error through the use of both the exponential function and the adaptive particle swarm optimisation (APSO) algorithm. The stability and effectiveness of the proposed method are proved by Lyapunov method and the simulations are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

AB The main objective of the study here presented consists in developing a mathematical forecasting model of the available wind power output for an eight-hour horizon in wind farms that may be affected by inclement meteorological environments where the surface of the wind turbine blades can suffer of ice accumulation. These events may depend on several factors as air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure or wind speed, among others. In this way a precise model depending on the referred variables will allow predicting with higher accuracy the available power at the plant when the referred events may occur. A model based in neural networks for the prediction of the available power output of an experimental wind farm has been developed and tested using real data. The proposed model outperforms other professional commercial models.

AB The directly-driven variable speed constant frequency wind power generation system, which consists of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), is connected to grid by full size power converters. When asymmetrical faults occur in grid, the DC voltage would not only exceed the rated value substantially, but also fluctuate significantly caused by the negative sequence components. Thus, the reliable and stable operation of wind power generation would be disturbed. Based on regular control strategy, this paper firstly analyzes the disability mechanism of DC voltage during faults. In order to suppress the DC-link overvoltage and ensure the steady recovery process of DC system when faults occur, an optimal segmented rotor speed controller with the auxiliary control function of Crowbar is proposed. Moreover, dual sequence current decoupling control scheme is designed for eliminating the second harmonic components, which causes DC voltage oscillation. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for improving asymmetrical fault ride through capability of PMSG is validated by PSCAD/EMTDC simulation compared with regular control.

AB A Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) based software was used to design a 300 kW, variable speed Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT). Chord lengths, blade twist angles and rotational speeds were allowed to change independently so as to achieve a maximum energy output, while design constraints were also being met. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) was use to validated the BEM calculation. According to low wind area, the rated wind speed was set quite low at 10 m/s. The optimal design of wind turbine reaches 50.5% efficiency at the design tip speed ratio of 7.5. The wind turbine can maintain 50.5% efficiency level over wind speeds range of 4-9 m/s by changing the rotating speeds from 16-36 RPM. Beyond the rated wind speed, the turbine can regulate its power by changing the rotating speed to decrease its efficiency and maintain the power output at 300 kW. Results from CFD agree well with the BEM calculation. It verifies that the optimum designed blade from the BEM was reliable. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An innovative transmission mechanism, referred to here as an independently controllable transmission (ICT), for application in variable speed wind turbines is described. This ICT mechanism can transmit rotational output speed that can be independently regulated by a controller and is not affected by the speed of the input shaft. Use of this ICT mechanism would make it possible for a variable speed wind turbine to be unaffected by rotor speed fluctuations and allow the generation of constant frequency electrical output of improved quality. The ICT mechanism is comprised of two planetary gear trains and two transmission-connecting members. The kinematic, static characteristics, and power flow of the ICT mechanism have been analyzed and derived as analytical equations. Demonstration examples and a prototype of the device have been built and tested to examine their kinematic and static characteristics and to verify the validity of the results.

AB The study of a Variable Speed Wind Energy Conversion System (VS-WECS) based on Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and interconnected to the electric network is presented. The system includes a wind turbine, a PMSG, two converters and an intermediate DC link capacitor. The effectiveness of the WECS can be greatly improved by using an appropriate control. Furthermore, the system has strong nonlinear multivariable with many uncertain factors and disturbances. Accordingly, the proposed control law combines Sliding Mode Variable Structure Control (SM-VSC) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control strategy to maximize the generated power from Wind Turbine Generator (WTG). Considering the variation of wind speed, the grid-side converter injects the generated power into the AC network, regulates DC-link voltage and it is used to achieve unity power factor, whereas the PMSG side converter is used to achieve Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Both converters used the sliding mode control scheme considering the variation of wind speed. The employed control strategy can regulate both the reactive and active power independently by quadrature and direct current components, respectively. With fluctuating wind, the controller is capable to maximize wind energy capturing. This work explores a sliding mode control approach to achieve power efficiency maximization of a WECS and to enhance system robustness to parameter variations. The performance of the system has been demonstrated under varying wind conditions. A comparison of simulation results based on SMC and PI controller is provided. The system is built using Matlab/Simulink environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Wind turbines in megawatt classification ordinarily rotate at variable speed in wind farm. Therefore turbine operation must be managed in order to maximize the conversion efficiency below rated power and reduce loading on the drive-train. In addition, to control the energy captured throughout operation above and below rated wind speed, researchers particularly employ pitch control of the blades. Thus, we could manage the energy captured throughout operation above and below rated wind speed using pitch control of the blades. This chapter suggests six new plans to conquer wind fluctuation problems based on a new Nero Fuzzy and Nero Fuzzy Genetic Controller where the fuzzy knowledge based are tuned automatically by Genetic Algorithm (GA) as known Tuned Fuzzy Genetic System (TFGS). Additionally In this Chapter, a new hybrid control has been trained that Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) has optimal performance. This method contains a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network (NN) (MLPNN) and a Fuzzy Rule extraction from a Trained Artificial Neural Network using Genetic Algorithm (FRENGA). Proposed Hybrid method recognizes disturbance wind with sensors and it generates desired pitch angle control by comparison between FRENGA and MLPNN results. One of them has better signal control is selected to send to pitch blade controller. Consequently Proposed strategies reject wind disturbance in Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs) input with pitch angel control generation. Consequently, proposed approaches have regulated output aerodynamic power and torque in the nominal range. Results indicate that the new proposed Artificial Intelligent (Al) methods extraction system outperform the best and earliest methods in controlling the output during wind fluctuation.

AB Gear boxes and direct-drive systems are commonly used in the transmission of large wind turbines. The components such as blades, rotor, gear box and the generator should be set up coaxially in the nacelle. Thus, the total weights of the nacelle increases with the size of the wind turbines. This research develops a hydrodynamic variable rotational speed transmission system combining with planetary gear-sets and the hydrodynamic transmission system for a 2MW wind turbine. The nonlinear dynamic models of hydrodynamic transmission system and planetary gear-sets are derived firstly. The dynamic simulation analysis for the feedback type hydrodynamic transmission system (FHDTS) with feedback planetary gear-sets is implemented using MATLAB/ SIMULINK. Finally, the closed-loop variable rotational speed control simulation combined with an intelligent controller can be achieved for evaluating the feasibility.

AB Wind turbine aerodynamic-mistuning phenomenon during the operation may cause great harm. This article is based on sliding mesh technique of three dimensional Unsteady CFD method, taking NREL Phase VI wind turbine as an example, study the pneumatic performance of wind turbine under the axial-flow condition, and compare with the experimental data. After validate the accuracy of the method, according to the effect of yaw and wind shear on the wind turbine aerodynamicmistuning, researched have been conducted: In a wind shear condition, the aerodynamic performance after the blade rotating one circle have been calculated in the different wind profile index. Because of the shear wind velocity, Airfoil load and flow parameters fluctuate approximately like the patterm of cyclical cosine function with the change of azimuth. And with wind profiles index and spanwise position increases, impulse amplitudes have been also increased; Under the circumstances of the constant wind speed and variable yaw angle, The aerodynamic power decreases with the increase of the yaw angle There are also some big differences at different azimuth angle of blade section.

   model; predictive control
AB Because of the randomness and fluctuation of wind energy, as well as the impact of strongly nonlinear characteristic of variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) wind power generation system with doubly fed induction generators (DFIG), traditional active power control strategies are difficult to achieve high precision control and the output power of wind turbines is more fluctuated. In order to improve the quality of output electric energy of doubly fed wind turbines, on the basis of analyzing the operating principles and dynamic characteristics of doubly fed wind turbines, this paper proposes a new active power optimal control method of doubly fed wind turbines based on predictive control theory. This method uses state space model of wind turbines, based on the prediction of the future state of wind turbines, moves horizon optimization, and meanwhile, gets the control signals of pitch angle and generator torque. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategies can guarantee the utilization efficiency for wind energy. Simultaneously, they can improve operation stability of wind turbines and the quality of electric energy.

DE Horizontal axiswind turbine design; Multidisciplinary design
   optimization; Robust design optimization; Uncertainty propagation
AB The work reported in this paper deals with the development of a design system for the robust aerodynamic design optimization of horizontal axis wind turbine rotors. The system developed is here used to design a 126-m diameter, three-bladed rotor, featuring minimal sensitivity to uncertainty associated with blade manufacturing tolerances. In particular, the uncertainty affecting the rotor geometry is associated with the radial distributions of blade chord and twist, and the airfoil thickness. In this study, both geometric and operative design variables are treated as part of the optimization. Airfoil aerodynamics and rotor aeroelasticity are predicted by means of XFOIL and FAST codes, respectively, and a novel deterministic method, the Univariate Reduced Quadrature, is used for uncertainty propagation. The optimization is performed by means of a two-stage multi-objective evolution-based algorithm, aiming to maximize the rotor expected annual energy production and minimize its standard deviation. The design optimization is subjected to a single structural constrain associated with the maximum out-of-plane blade tip deflection. The results of this research highlight that a lower sensitivity to uncertainty tied to manufacturing tolerances can be achieved by lowering the angular speed of the rotor.

AB This paper presents the performance evaluation of standalone hybrid system on Photovoltaic (PV)-Wind generator at Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FKE), UTeM. The hybrid PV-Wind in UTeM system is combining wind turbine system with the solar system and the energy capacity of this hybrid system can generate up to charge the battery and supply the LED street lighting load. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the performance of PV-Wind hybrid generator. Solar radiation meter has been used to measure the solar radiation and anemometer has been used to measure the wind speed. The effectiveness of the PV-Wind system is based on the various data that has been collected and compared between them. The result shows that hybrid system has greater reliability. Based on the solar result, the correlation coefficient shows strong relationship between the two variables of radiation and current. The reading output current followed by fluctuate of solar radiation. However, the correlation coefficient is shows moderate relationship between the two variables of wind speed and voltage. Hence, the wind turbine system in FKE show does not operate consistently to produce energy source for this hybrid system compare to PV system. When the wind system does not fully operate due to inconsistent energy source, the other system which is PV will operate and supply the load for equilibrate the extra load demand.

AB Most offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are designed according to the international standard IEC 61400-3 which requires consideration of several design load cases under 50-year extreme storm conditions during which the wind turbine is not operational (i.e. the rotor is parked and blades are feathered). Each of these load cases depends on combinations of at least three jointly distributed metocean parameters, the mean wind speed, the significant wave height, and the peak spectral period. In practice, these variables are commonly estimated for the 50-year extreme storm using a simple but coarse method, wherein 50-year values of wind speed and wave height are calculated independently and combined with a range of peak spectral period conditioned on the 50-year wave height. The IEC Standard does not provide detailed guidance on how to calculate the appropriate range of peak spectral period. Given the varying correlation of these parameters from site-to-site, this approach is clearly an approximation which is assumed to overestimate structural loads since wind and wave are combined without regard to their correlation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative multivariate method for assessing extreme storm conditions. The method is based on the Nataf model and the Inverse First Order Reliability Method (IFORM) and uses measurements or hindcasts of wind speed, wave height and peak spectral period to estimate an environmental surface which defines combinations of these parameters with a particular recurrence period. The method is illustrated using three sites along the U.S. Atlantic coast near Maine, Delaware and Georgia. Mudline moments are calculated using this new multivariate method for a hypothetical 5 MW OWT supported by a monopile and compared with mudline moments calculated using simpler univariate approaches. The results of the comparison highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate range of the peak spectral period when using the simpler univariate approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ID TURBINE POWER; ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY; SPEED
AB The simplest power curves model wind power only as a function of the wind speed at the turbine hub height. While the latter is an essential predictor of power output, wind speed information in other parts of the vertical profile, as well as additional atmospheric variables, are also important determinants of power. The goal of this work was to determine the gain in predictive ability afforded by adding wind speed information at other heights, as well as other atmospheric variables, to the power prediction model. Using data from a wind farm with a moderately complex terrain in the Altamont Pass region in California, we trained three statistical models-a neural network, a random forest and a Gaussian process model-to predict power output from various sets of aforementioned predictors. The comparison of these predictions to the observed power data revealed that considerable improvements in prediction accuracy can be achieved both through the addition of predictors other than the hub-height wind speed and the use of statistical models. To our knowledge, the use of the Gaussian process model in this context is new, in contrast to neural networks and random forests. The advantage of this model over the other two models is that it provides a much more natural way to estimate the uncertainty associated with its predictions. In addition, this study presents one of the most comprehensive analyses to date of the relative importance of various wind power curve inputs. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Model Reference Controller (MRC) for contribution of Variable Speed Wind Generators (VSWG) in inertial response of Electrical Power System (EPS) is presented and analyzed in this paper. MRC is synthesized based on a model of Generating Unit With non-Reheat Steam Turbine (GUNRST) thus enabling VSWG to emulate GUNRST response during the initial stage of dynamic frequency response ie inertial phase. Very important property of conventional steam generating units is that its contribution to inertial phase response is independent from the initial generating power. By using MRC in VSWG it is accomplished that in most common wind speed region (3-12 m/s) VSWG inertial support is almost independent from wind speed. Since in most EPSs VSWG replaces conventional steam generators, application of MRC algorithm provides that the characteristics of EPS in terms of inertial response are preserved, regardless of the growing trend of introducing VSWG. Evaluation analysis of the proposed MRC is performed on modified nine bus power system when VSWG with MRC is connected to one of the power system buses.

AB A simple control strategy has been proposed for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode and constant output power mode operation of variable speed wind turbine system employing wound rotor induction generators (WRIGs). The control strategy proposed in this paper has been implemented using TMS320LF2407A real time digital signal processor (DSP) and detailed procedure for such implementation is given. The salient feature of the proposed controller is that it employs only a single switch, which is an IGBT chopper and does not require any mechanical sensors or machine parameters. This makes the overall controller simple, flexible and robust. Further, space heating and battery loads are connected at rotor side of the machine through a diode bridge rectifier and the IGBT chopper. A method has been developed for the analysis of such grid connected WRIGs with variable external resistance at the chopper circuit. The successful working of the proposed controller has been amply demonstrated through extensive simulation and experimental results on the WRIG system for MPPT and constant output power operation.

ID EXPERIMENTAL-VERIFICATION
AB This paper presents experimental results and its assessment of a variable-speed wind power generation system (VSWPGS) using permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and boost chopper circuit (BCC). Experimental results are obtained by a test bench with a wind turbine emulator (WTE). WTE reproduces the behaviors of a windmill by using servo motor drives. The mechanical torque references to drive the servo motor are calculated from the windmill wing profile, wind velocity, and windmill rotational speed. VSWPGS using PMSG and BCC has three speed control modes for the level of wind velocity to control the rotational speed of the wind turbine. The control mode for low wind velocity regulates an armature current of generator with BCC. The control mode for middle wind velocity regulates a DC link voltage with a vector-controlled inverter. The control mode for high wind velocity regulates a pitch angle of the wind turbine with a pitch angle control system. The hybrid of three control modes extends the variable-speed range. BCC simplifies the maintenance of VSWPGS while improving reliability. In addition, VSWPGS using PMSG and BCC saves cost compared with VSWPGS using a PWM converter.

AB This paper presents the impacts caused by the integration of variable speed wind turbines on long-term voltage stability. The technologies used are fully rated converter (FRC) and doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with two control strategies: grid-side converter (GSC) at unity power factor, which is usually adopted, and GSC controlling reactive power. Also, this paper considers wind turbines capability curves and its variable limits, since they are subject to several limitations that changes with the operating point and wind speed. This study also considers the dynamic models of over excitation limiter (OEL) and on-load tap changers (OLTC) combined with static and dynamic loads using time domain simulations. Different penetration levels of wind generation are analyzed. The results show that long-term voltage stability can be improved when GSC of DFIG is controlling reactive power. Moreover, the capability curve plays an important role in this analysis since reactive power is a key requirement to maintain voltage stability.

AB This paper describes a novel approach of maximum power control for small wind turbines by using predicted wind speed data. Because of the moment of inertia of the wind turbine, when using conventional control method, the time lag of control will occur due to turbulence in the environment. Our proposed control system uses future information, which is the predicted wind speed, for wind turbine control. The control algorithm creates a reference trajectory of the rotational speed of the wind turbine. The advantage of using the predicted data is that the controller can operate the wind turbine efficiently so that the rotational speed of the wind turbine catches up with the reference speed at the maximum power point. Simulation results show improvement of generation efficiency compared to the conventional control method. Then we discuss the influence of the prediction error of wind speed on control performance.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SYSTEMS; LOAD
AB Model predictive control (MPC) is receiving attention in wind turbine controller design due to its ability to explicitly handle state and input constraints. Robust model predictive control (RMPC) additionally accounts for uncertainty in the future evolution of the system. Here, RMPC is compared with nominal MPC for the purposes of fore-aft tower damping of large wind turbines. The two controllers are identical save for their handling of the multiplicative and additive uncertainty in the prediction horizon. The comparison is performed by means of fatigue analysis in a state-of-the-art aeroelastic simulation package. State and input constraints are applied to a control model that is identified by data-driven methods. The robust controller bounds the uncertainty with a sequence of polytopes, which tighten the constraints to reduce constraint violations, while retaining the computational complexity of a quadratic program.

AB The fast-growing technology of large scale wind turbines demands control systems capable of enhancing both the efficiency of capturing wind power, and the useful life of the turbines themselves. l(1)-Optimal control is an approach to deal with persistent exogenous disturbances which have bounded magnitude (l(infinity)-norm) such as realistic wind disturbances and turbulence profiles. In this brief, we develop an efficient method to compute the l(1)-norm of a system. As the control synthesis problem is nonconvex, we use the proposed method to design the optimal output feedback controllers for a linear model of a wind turbine at different operating points using genetic algorithm optimization. The locally optimized controllers are interpolated using a gain-scheduled technique with guaranteed stability. The controller is tested with comprehensive simulation studies on a 5 MW wind turbine using fatigue, aerodynamics, structures, and turbulence (FAST) software. The proposed controller is compared with a well-tuned proportional-integral (PI) controller. The results show improved power quality, and decrease in the fluctuations of generator torque and rotor speed.

AB An efficient control strategy of a wind energy conversion system (WECS) plays a crucial role in wind power utilization. In this paper, a novel multivariable control strategy for a variable-speed variable-pitch WECS is proposed. It is designed for the complete operating regions of a wind turbine, including both of the partial load region and the full load region, with the objectives of maximizing energy capture, smoothing power output, alleviating drive train transient loads, and reducing pitch actuator activities. In particular, this paper considers the wind speed disturbance as norm-bounded, instead of deterministic or chance constraints in the widely used quadratic control methods such as linear quadratic Gaussian control and model predictive control. Moreover, the WECS control with the norm-bounded disturbance is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem that has not been previously employed for wind power control. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

AB This paper deals with the power acquisition control of variable-speed wind energy conversion systems under inaccurate wind speed measurements. The control goal is to optimize the power capture from wind by tracking the maximum power curve. Firstly, the controller is designed for the case with known aerodynamic torque, which is a common assumption in many literatures. In this controller, the need for the exact knowledge of the system model is waived by using adaptive technologies. The chattering phenomenon in the generator torque, which can result in high mechanical stress, is avoided by adopting a modified robust term. Then, by utilizing an online approximator to learn an auxiliary term induced by the uncertain aerodynamics, the need for the exact knowledge of the aerodynamic torque is waived. Both of the proposed controllers are capable of providing good performance under inaccurate wind speed measurements. The control objective is obtained in the sense that the tracking error is guaranteed to converge to an arbitrarily small set. It is theoretically proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded via Lyapunov synthesis. Finally, the performance of our proposed controller is shown by simulating on a 1.5MW three-blade wind turbine using the FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) code developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
