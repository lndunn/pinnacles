AB Maximizing wind turbine energy capture has become an important issue as more turbines are installed in low wind areas. This paper investigates the application of extremum seeking control (ESC) to maximizing the energy capture of variable speed wind turbine. The optimal control torque and pitch angle are searched via ESC based on the measurement of output power The advantage is the independency from accurate wind measurement. Simulation has been conducted on FAST for a wind turbine dynamic model, under uniformly steady wind, stair-case wind speed variations, and turbulence wind The simulation results indicated that the captured power increased by up to 4% over the standard torque control. Anti-windup ESC was then applied to overcome the actuation saturation which may disable the ESC process. Finally, the ESC with high-pass filter input resetting was applied to speed tip the transient under abrupt change of wind

   Simulation
AB Power output fluctuation of 2 MW-wind turbine-generator systems, which apply fixed speed operation and variable speed operation separately, is analyzed through numerical simulation carried out by using an observed field wind data. The fixed speed operation has two levels of operating rotational speeds in response to the wind speed. The variable speed operation has two operation modes: a constant tip speed ratio operation mode at low wind speeds and constant speed operation mode at high wind speeds. For any operation, the pitch angle is controlled to maintain rated electric power output at high wind speeds. The simulation result shows that the variable speed operation can reduce the power output fluctuations with both long and short periods as compared with the fixed speed operation due to rotational inertia of the rotor. Furthermore, it is revealed that the pitch angle control is effective to reduce the power output fluctuation with long periods for any operation.

AB Based oil the control requirement of power regulation, spindle brake and yaw, the electro-hydraulic proportional integrated system of wind turbine was designed. Then the semi-physical simulation test-bed combined with the design software (BLADED) of wind turbine was formed. The piecewise PID pitch-controlled algorithm and the control strategy for the switchover between variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) and pitch control were used in the test-bed. The results show that when the wind Speed is higher than the rating, the output power through the piecewise PID control is more stable compared with normal PID control. And when the wind speed is kept around the rating, the switchover between VSCF and pitch control runs well and the demand of power control and optimal energy capture is satisfied.

AB This paper present the application of multimode soft switch IGBT variable speed converter (VSC) as a power interface in a hybrid wind power generation consisting of wind turbine, modular generator, and auxiliary photovoltaic array for electricity generation and storage. The system uses a modular-fed induction generator for the wind turbine and another generator for the diesel generation-unit. The 48Vdc photovoltaic module serves as ride "thru utility".
   The generator is connected to the grid through power electronic converters and is operated in variable speed mode to maximize the wind energy, as well as balancing the system load demand with less fuel consumption and operates at a 1/3 the power of wind turbine rating. VSC reduces mechanical stress, noise, increases energy production and smooth the fluctuation of power injected into the grid. The unit has four-quadrant capability with an active front end that provides full regeneration to the Source, controllable power factor, and flux vector control that allows for instantaneous torque regulation. (VSC) has peak efficiencies of over 96% with total harmonic distortion of less than 3%. The converter works both in grid-tied and stand alone configurations. Math lab is used for the system model simulation.

AB Modern Wind Turbines adjust their blades orientation at different wind speeds for power control and optimum energy production. A big slewing ring about 2 metres diameter placed at each blade root, allows the blade orientation withstanding highly variable heavy loads, vibrations, continuous rotating oscillations and severe ambient conditions.
   The blade pitch system design and control strategy in a WTG is strongly conditioned by the load dependant friction of the bearing that shall be accurately defined for cost-effective designs. The pitch system is also the main brake of the rotor requiring high reliability for their components under fatigue loads, and in particular for the slewing rings due to its inherent difficulties for maintenance or replacement.
   The present methodology allows the fatigue and friction estimation of slewing rings, based on rolling bearing models and classical theories like Hertz, Lundberg-Palmgren, and Miner fatigue cumulative damage. This approach simulates the stress supported by each ball in the contact with the raceways, estimates the bearing friction due to these contact stresses, and the fatigue life of the overall bearing.

AB The control problem associated to a class of horizontal-axis fixed-pitch variable-speed low-power wind energy conversion systems, working in the partial load region, consisting in the energy conversion maximization, is approached here under the assumption that the wind turbine model and its parameters are poorly known. Using a new approach derived from the optimum seeking methods category, generically called Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), the proposed control solution aims at driving the average position of the operating point near to optimality. Instead of inducing sinusoidal search signals, the wind turbulence is here used as search disturbance. The high-speed shaft's average rotational speed is slowly adjusted using the Fast Fourier Transform processing of some available measures from the system as an estimate of the operating point's position/distance to optimality. Numerical simulations are used for preliminary checking the control law based on this estimation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system is being applied to the modern wind turbines, because it has many advantages such as the,variable-speed operation, relatively high efficiency and the small converter size. This paper proposes a protection algorithm for a DFIG based on the d-q equivalent circuit in the time domain. In the DFIG, the voltages and currents of the rotor the stator side are available. The proposed algorithm estimates the instantaneous induced voltages using the voltages and currents of the rotor and the stator side. If the difference between the two estimated induced voltages exceeds the threshold, the proposed algorithm detects the internal fault. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated under various operating and fault conditions using PSCAD/EMTDC.

AB The blade bearings are main components of a wind turbine. The operation safety of the wind turbine depends on the blade bearings. In order to study the dynamic loads of the blade bearings, different operation conditions of the blade bearing system are discussed based on aerodynamic characteristics and the Blade Element Theory. The yawing movement of the wind turbine is studied with the consideration of the attack angle, the propeller pitch angle, yawing rotation, gravity and moment of inertia force, a mathematical model is put forward, which can be used to study the loads of the blade bearing system of the wind turbine. Numerical calculation is used to investigate the influence of the attack angle, the pitch angle of blade, yawing speed and the wind speed in different conditions on the loads of the blade bearing. The load curves are obtained under different operation conditions. It is found that the loads in different directions increase with the increment of attack angle. The variable trend of the loads is changed, when the pitch angle is greater than a certain angle. The loads of the blade bearing are also influenced by the gyroscopic torque at different yawing speeds.

AB With improved generator and turbine designs, better control techniques and low environmental impact, wind energy has emerged as a potential source of bulk power across the globe. In this paper, the authors report on the development of a variable speed controller for a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS). DFIG is preferred as the generator because of several advantages such as high energy efficiency, robustness and easy controllability. Firstly, a mathematical model of the DFIG is developed in an appropriate d-q reference frame for simulation purpose. Secondly, the controller is designed to control the power exchange between the stator of the DFIG and the utility grid network. Two types of control strategies are considered PI control and pitch angle (Pitch-to-feather) control. The respective performances of the two types of controllers are compared in terms of power reference tracking, response to sudden speed variations, sensitivity to perturbations and robustness against machine parameters variations.

AB Fixed speed wind turbines have low efficiency as compared to variable-speed, fixed-pitch wind turbines. The latter are required to optimize power output performance without the aerodynamic controls. A wind turbine system is operated such that the points of wind rotor curve and electrical generator curve coincide. In order to obtain maximum power output of a wind turbine generator system, it is necessary to drive the wind rotor at an optimal rotor speed for a particular wind speed. A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller is used for this purpose. In fixed-pitch variable-speed wind turbines, wind-rotor parameters are fixed and the restoring torque of the generator needs to be adjusted to maintain optimum rotor speed at a particular wind speed for optimum power output. In turbulent wind environment, control of variable-speed fixed-pitch wind turbine systems to continuously operate at the maximum power points becomes difficult due to fluctuation of wind speeds. Therefore, a special emphasis is given to operating at maximum aerodynamic power points of the wind rotor. In this study, wind speed forecasting techniques are considered for predictive optimum control system of wind turbines to reduce response time of the MPPT controller.

AB A unified, modular, small-signal dynamic model for an induction machine-based wind farm is presented. The proposed model can represent an arbitrary number of fixed-speed, partially variable-speed (doubly fed) and variable-speed induction machine-based wind units in a wind farm. The model represents the dynamics of (i) each wind turbine-generator electromechanical system, (ii) each converter system and the corresponding controls and (iii) the host electrical grid, within the subsynchronous frequency range (0.1-60 Hz). In contrast to the widely used state-space formulation, the proposed approach is based on developing electrical and mechanical transfer-function matrices to formulate the overall system as a multivariable feedback system. Thus, it provides significant flexibility to represent a large number of wind units and their controllers, identical or nonidentical, within a wind farm.
   Based on the developed model, a frequency response-based method is also introduced, as an alternative to the eigen analysis approach, for small-signal subsynchronous dynamic analysis of the wind farm and its host electrical grid. The proposed method provides a new performance robustness criterion for performance evaluation and also a design tool based on the 'size' of the system transfer-function matrix. The concept of induced norm is adopted here as a measure of matrix size. As an example, applications of the model and the analysis approach to a two-unit wind farm is presented and the results are validated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.

DE Loads extrapolation; aeroelastic stimulation; extreme events
AB Extrapolation techniques used for predicting long-term wind turbine loads have produced highly variable loading estimates dependent on the individual designer implementation. To reduce such variability, more precise definition and validation of these techniques ore necessary. As port of a wider effort to test loads extrapolation techniques used in wind turbine design, two data sets were created. The first data set was created as an example typical of what designers use to extrapolate loads according to wind turbine design standards. The second data set was a series of year-long simulations that could be used to quantify the accuracy of extrapolation methods. Due to the large number of simulations, care was taken not to reproduce random samplings in individual time series. Additionally, a grid computing architecture was used to run the simulations in a reasonable time frame. The wind speeds where loads were highest were identified, which varied with loading type. The identification of dominant wind speeds is important to ensure an adequate number of simulations at such speeds, which often influence extrapolated loads. In-plane loads and deflections tended to be dominated by high wind speeds near cut-out wind speed. Out-of plane loads and deflections were most influenced by winds that were near the rated wind speed. Some loads were influenced by a range of wind speeds. The loads dominated by high wind speeds had greater variability in the extreme values, which could be a reflection of the greatly varying wind and also greater sensitivity to higher energy content of the wind at such speeds.

AB In this paper, we present the voltage build up process and the terminal voltage control of an isolated wind powered induction generator driven by a variable speed wind turbine using rotor flux oriented vector control. A description of the studied system is provided, and a simulation study is presented. The model used for the autonomous induction generator is a diphase one obtained by application of the Park transform. This model permits, when adopting some simplifying hypotheses, taking account the saturation effect. Wind powered isolated induction generators have an input, wind. that is not controllable, but they can be set to operate within a given variation of speed. Unlike a grid connected induction generator, in an isolated case, there should be a control system that keeps the DC bus voltage at a constant value when the speed of the rotor varies. The paper presents the control system to maintain the DC bus voltage at a constant value. The obtained results are presented and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper a hybrid energy system combining variable speed wind turbine, solar photovoltaic and fuel cell generation systems is presented to supply continuous power to residential power applications as stand-alone loads. The wind and photovoltaic systems are used as main energy sources while the fuel cell is used as secondary or back-up energy source. Three individual dc-dc boost converters are used to control the power flow to the load. A simple and cost effective control with dc-dc converters is used for maximum power point tracking and hence maximum power extracting from the wind turbine and the solar photovoltaic systems. The hybrid system is sized to power a typical 2 kW/150 V dc load as telecommunication power plants or ac residential power applications in isolated islands continuously throughout the year.
   The results show that even when the sun and wind are not available; the system is reliable and available and it can supply high-quality power to the load. The simulation results which proved the accuracy of the proposed controllers are given to demonstrate the availability of the proposed system in this paper. Also, a complete description of the management and control system is presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern power generation systems for wind turbines are often based on the rotor fed slip-ring machines. Power electronics convener provides the slip power, and also the reactive power for excitation of the generator during standalone operation. This way the isolated load can be supplied even if the grid has failed. Stator voltage in an autonomous operation is controlled using vectorial phase locked loop (PLL) structure: therefore the information about mechanical speed or angular position of the rotor is eliminated from the control method. The second PLL is also used for synchronization of the generated voltage with the grid voltage. Voltages synchronization is necessary for soft connection and protection of the supplied load front the rapid change of the supply voltage phase. The grid-connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) can be useful after grid fault: however, the mains outage detection rnethods are necessary for fast disconnection after grid failures.

AB Three blades of a 3 kW prototype wind turbine generator were designed with thin airfoil and a tip speed ratio of 3. The wind turbine has been controlled via two control methods: the variable pitch angle and by regulation of the field current of the generator and examined under real wind conditions. The characteristics of the thin airfoil, called "Seven arcs thin airfoil" named so because the air-foil is composed of seven circular arcs, are analyzed with the airfoil design and analysis program XFOIL. The thin airfoil blade is designed and calculated by blade element and momentum theory. The performance characteristics of the machine such as rotational speed, generator output as well as stability for wind speed changes are described. In the case of average wind speeds of 10 m/s and a maximum of 19 m/s, the automatically controlled wind turbine ran safely through rough wind conditions and showed an average generator output of 1105 W and a power coefficient 0.14.

AB This paper describes a manner in which the energy-reliability optimization of wind energy conversion systems' operation can be achieved by means of the sliding mode control. The proposed approach aims at designing a tradeoff between maximizing the power harvested from wind by a horizontal-axis-grid-connected variable-speed doubly-fed-induction-generator-based wind power system and minimizing its mechanical stress. An appropriate sliding surface has been found in the speed-power plane, which allows the operation more or less close to the optimal regimes characteristic. Thus, by torque controlling the generator, an energy-reliability optimization of the wind turbine behavior is performed. The proposed control law is validated by both off-line and real-time simulation; the latter on a dedicated experimental rig, based upon the hardware-in-the-loop simulation concept. The results show that the control objective is fully accomplished.

AB The dynamics of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with a closed-loop control is analysed. The analysis provides explanations of the impact of the closed-loop control on the DFIG dynamics and relevant modelling requirements for power system stability studies. The discussion considers generic PI controllers for the regulation of rotor speed, reactive power and pitch angle. It is shown that for the closed-loop-controlled DFIG, a simplified model, whereby both stator and rotor dynamics are neglected, is adequate. In such model, stator and rotor variables are algebraic, that is, they change instantaneously and the modelled dynamics are those of the controllers and mechanical parts. The observations and conclusions are obtained from eigenvalue, participation factor and time-domain analysis.

AB The present development of power electronic encourages to use variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driving a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), wound field synchronous generator (WFSG) or permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) for wind power generation. Among those, operation and stability analyses (both dynamic and transient) of DFIG type of VSWT have already been reported in many literatures. On the other hand, operation and stability analyses of synchronous generator type of VSWT are not sufficient enough. This paper focuses on various operations of variable speed wind turbine driving a PMSG (VSWT-PMSG), developing suitable control strategies for the frequency converter in the system. Dynamic characteristic of VSWT-PMSG is analyzed using real wind speed data measured in Hokkaido Island of Japan. Transient characteristic of VSWT-PMSG during network fault condition is also analyzed in detail for both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults. Moreover, permanent fault due to unsuccessful reclosing is considered, which is one of the salient features of this study. Extensive simulation results are presented which verifies the effectiveness of the control strategy of VSWT-PMSG at different operating regions.

AB In this paper, a doubly fed variable speed wind induction generator connected to the grid associated to a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is investigated. The dynamic behaviour of a wind generator, including the models of the wind turbine (aerodynamic), the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), a ac/ac direct converter, the converter control (algorithm of VENTURINI) and the power control of this system, is studied. Also investigated is a control method of the FESS system, which consists of the classical squirrel-cage induction machine supplied off the variable speed wind generator (VSWG) through a rectifier-inverter cascade arrangement. Simulation results obtained on the basis of the dynamic models of the wind generator are presented, for different operating points, to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system.

AB A multi-body aeroelostic design code based on the implementation of the combined aeroelastic beam element is extended to cover closed loop operation conditions of wind turbines. The equations of a controller for variable generator speed and pitch-controlled operation in high wind speeds ore combined with the oeroelostic equations of motion for the complete wind turbine, in order to provide a compound aeroservoelostic system of equations. The control equations comprise linear differential equations for the pitch and generator torque actuators, the control feedback elements (proportionol-integral control) and the various filters acting on the feedback signals. In its non-linear form, the dynamic equations ore integrated in time to provide the reference state, while upon linearization of the system and transformation in the non-rotating frame, the linear stability equations are derived. Stability results for a multi-MW wind turbine show that the coupling of the controller dynamics with the aeroelostic dynamics of the machine is important and must be taken into account in view of defining the controller parameters.

DE direct-driven wind turbines; permanent magnet synchronous generators;

AB Emphasis of this article is on variable-speedpitch-controlled wind turbines with multi-pole permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and on their extremely soft drive-train shafts. A model and a control strategy for a full back-to-back converter wind turbine with multi-pole PMSG are described. The model comprises submodels of the aerodynamic rotor, the drive-train by a two-mass model, the permanent magnet generator and the full-scale converter system. The control strategy, which embraces both the wind turbine control itself and the control of the full-scale converter, has tasks to control independently the active and reactive powers, to assist the power system and to ensure a stable normal operation of the wind turbine itself A multi-pole PMSG connected to the grid through a full-scale converter has no inherent damping, and therefore, such configuration can become practically unstable, if no damping by means of external measures is applied. In this work, the frequency converter is designed to damp actively the drive-train oscillations, thus ensuring stable operation. The dynamic performance of the presented model and control strategy is assessed and emphasized in normal operation conditions by means of simulations in the power system simulation tool DIgSILENT.

An introduction of the subject and a state of the art review for controllers in ARWS are carried. out. Afterwards, the studied VSPRWT and its validated model are presented. Then, the operating zone and control scheme are described. This system is non-linear and its linearising allows for the analysis of its behaviour, thereby obtaining the discrete-time control model as well as defining the controller's concrete objectives. The digital controller, which is designed following the pole assignment with sensitivity function shaping method, provides satisfactory simulation trial results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The power generation system with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), which can be used as an autonomous power system after the loss of mains in a distributed generation network, is described. After the mains outage, a fixed frequency and an amplitude of the output voltage are obtained, despite the variable rotor speed. For this reason, it can be successfully applied in the variable-speed wind turbines, adjustable speed water plants, or diesel engines. Moreover, the stand-alone operation of DFIG is useful in a flywheel-based high-energy rotary uninterruptible power supply system. An output voltage is controlled directly by the synchronization of an actual voltage vector with the reference vector represented in a synchronously rotating polar frame. The rotor current angular speed is obtained as a result of vectorial phase-locked loop operation. Any sensors or estimators of the rotor speed or position are unnecessary. Both amplitude and angle control loops are linear. The use of stand-alone operation in grid-connected systems requires mains outage detection. Also, the grid voltage recovery requires a method of synchronization and soft connection of a generator to the grid. The proposed methods of output voltage control, synchronization, and detection of mains loss were tested in a laboratory system.

DT Article
DE wind energy; wind turbine control; adaptive pitch control
AB The aerodynamic efficiency of a variable-speed wind turbine operating in Region 2, or below-rated wind speeds, is greatly affected by the identification of accurate parameters for the controller. In particular, the power coefficient (C(p)) surface must be well known for optimal efficiency to be achieved with a constant-gain controller. However, adaptive control can overcome the inefficiencies caused by inaccurate knowledge of the C(p) surface. Previous work focused on adaptive torque gain control to cause a variable-speed turbine to operate, on average, at the tip-speed ratio lambda(*) for which the maximum C(p) occurs. This paper considers the effects of adaptive blade pitch angle control on a turbine's aerodynamic efficiency. Computer simulations and tests on a field turbine are used to verify the adaptive pitch control scheme. Simulation and field test results demonstrate that the adaptive pitch controller causes the pitch angle to approach its optimal value. Adaptive pitch control can be used to seek the optimal pitch angle for energy capture in Region 2 operation. Additional field operation is required before a statistically significant improvement in energy capture can be demonstrated.

ID SYSTEM DYNAMICS; INVERTER; GENERATOR
AB Maximum electric power extraction out of available wind power is directly linked to advanced variable speed wind turbine control. The paper presents a memory-based method for variable speed adjustment of wind energy conversion systems. The fundamental idea behind the method is to use certain memorized information (i.e., current rotor speed tracking error, most recent speed tracking error, and previous control experience) to directly modify the firing angle control command sequences. The salient feature of the proposed approach lies in its simplicity in design and implementation. Furthermore, the total required memory space does not grow with time and is much smaller than most existing learning control methods. It is shown that this method, when applied to firing angle control of wind turbines, is able to ensure rotor speed tracking in the presence of varying operation conditions, as verified via computer simulation.

AB A model to explain and predict market-driven investment in renewable energy capital is proposed. The model is suitable for application to the biomass, wind, solar and ocean-derived energy industries. It basically assumes that, given a set of prices and a specific technology, the marginal efficiency of capital invested in these industries only depends on the productivity of the project's site and on its energy transport distance. As suggested by traditional investment theory, the model supposes that only those projects offering marginal efficiencies of capital above the current available rate of interest would be implemented, thus demarcating a region in the productivity-energy transport distance space where all the economically viable projects should lie. By relating this region to the geographic space available for development, total potential investment can be deduced. By using cash flows defined in variable energy transport distance and mean wind speed, a case study for the Chilean wind energy industry is presented. The use of the model to analyse the effect of alternative support schemes for wind energy in Chile is briefly demonstrated. It is concluded that for increasing the area economically available for the development of new wind farms, a research and development support scheme aimed at reducing investment cost of wind turbines by 25% is equivalent to a 20% price subsidy on energy.

AB Wind and solar resources are, by nature, spatially distributed and temporally variable. The process of siting generators that use these renewable resources and integrating them into the electricity system therefore raises different issues than the same process for combustion facilities does. A method for discovering wind power sites with the highest value to the electricity system was developed and is illustrated here using data for the state of Michigan. This method combines readily available hourly average 10 m wind speed data with wholesale electricity price data, as hourly locational marginal price (LMP). The 10 m wind speed data from 72 sites were extrapolated vertically to 80 m turbine hub height, converted to wind power density, and interpolated horizontally via kriging to reconstruct a continuous surface. LMP data from 178 generator nodes were allocated across space using Thiessen polygons. High LMP was interpreted as a signal of insufficiency or weakness in the electricity system, and wind energy was considered a possible remedy. The method, implemented in a GIS, identifies when and where peaks in LMP and wind power density co-occur and highlights these events as high value. As the drive to incorporate more renewable generators into the electricity system increases, this method will help locate the most desirable sites based on wind resource characteristics and the structure of the larger electricity system. Proposing a new way to think about the value of the wind resource to the electricity system is a primary contribution of this work. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Operation of variable speed wind turbine generator (WTG) in the above-rated region characterized by high turbulence intensities demands a trade-off between two performance metrics: maximization of energy harvested from the wind and minimization of damage caused by mechanical fatigue. This paper presents a learning adaptive controller for output power leveling and decrementing cyclic loads on the drive train. The proposed controller incorporates a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) augmented by a neurocontroller (NC) and regulates rotational speed by specifying the demanded generator torque. Pitch control ensures rated power output. A second-order model and a stochastic wind field model are used in the analysis. The LQG is used as a basis upon which the performance of the proposed paradigm in the trade-off studies is assessed. Simulation results indicate the proposed control scheme effectively harmonizes the relation between rotor speed and the highly turbulent wind speed thereby regulating shaft moments and maintaining rated power.

DE Primary frequency control; Variable speed wind generator; Power reserve;

AB This paper presents a hardware implementation of the participation of a wind turbine to network primary frequency control. The increase of renewable production of electricity requires the participation of these generators to ancillary services. The proposed method, by actions on the pitch angle and the generator torque through fuzzy logic controllers, creates a power reserve. This reserve is regular on a large range of wind speeds and is constituted without any wind speed measurement. Furthermore, the proposed strategy uses this reserve in case of frequency deviation to provide additional active power to stabilise the electrical grid. The implementation of such strategy on a 2.2 kW test bench representing a wind turbine and its generator validates the practical feasibility of the method. Finally, the regularity of the reserve is shown to be weakly dependant on the dynamics of the wind turbine controls.

AB Wind energy systems have been considered for Canada's remote communities in order to reduce their costs and dependence on diesel fuel to generate electricity. Given the high capital costs, low-penetration wind-diesel systems have been typically found not to be economic. High-penetration wind-diesel systems have the benefit of increased economies of scale, and displacing significant amounts of diesel fuel, but have the disadvantage of not being able to capture all of the electricity that is generated when the wind turbines operate at rated capacity.
   Two representative models of typical remote Canadian communities were created using HOMER, an NREL micro-power simulator to model how a generic energy storage system could help improve the economics of a high-penetration wind-diesel system. Key variables that affect the optimum system are average annual wind speed, cost of diesel fuel, installed cost of storage and a storage systems overall efficiency. At an avoided cost of diesel fuel of 0.30 $Cdn/kWh and current installed costs, wind generators are suitable in remote Canadian communities only when an average annual wind speed of at least 6.0 m/s is present. Wind energy storage systems become viable to consider when average annual wind speeds approach 7.0 m/s, if the installed cost of the storage system is less than 1000 $Cdn/kW and it is capable of achieving at least a 75% overall energy conversion efficiency. In such cases, energy storage system can enable an additional 50% of electricity from wind turbines to be delivered. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the problem of controlling power generation in variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (VS-WECS). These systems have two operation regions depending on the wind turbine tip-speed ratio. They are distinguished by minimum phase behavior in one of these regions and a nonminimum phase in the other one. A sliding mode control strategy is then proposed to ensure stability in both operation regions and to impose the ideal feedback control solution despite model uncertainties. The proposed sliding mode control strategy presents attractive features such as robustness to parametric uncertainties of the turbine and the generator as well as to electric grid disturbances. The proposed sliding mode control approach has been simulated on a 1.5-MW three-blade wind turbine to evaluate its consistency and performance. The next step was the validation using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine simulator called the fatigue, aerodynamics, structures, and turbulence code (FAST). Both simulation and validation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of power regulation. Moreover, the sliding mode approach is arranged so as to produce no chattering in the generated torque that could lead to increased mechanical stress because of strong torque variations.

AB There is a possibility of having a small rechargeable battery bank consisting of one or two groups of batteries inside a wind turbine tower. This paper investigates such a possibility for wind turbines using double fed induction generators (DFIGs). Two schemes are proposed. The first scheme, BSI, uses rechargeable batteries as an energy source/sink for the control of generator rotor currents. The second scheme, BS2, in addition to the batteries under BS1, has another group of batteries to smooth wind turbine power output and to provide power balancing and emergency support to the grid. A case study is used to evaluate these two schemes. The study is based on the statistics of the wind speeds measured at Dunstaffnage, Scotland, and the manufacturer's data for the turbine generator. It shows that if the proposed BS2 scheme is adopted and some mild assumptions are used in simulation: (1) variation of the turbine power output to the grid is reduced - the variation of the output of a wind farm is within 13% of the combined ratings of all turbines in the farm; (2) less variation in power also means smoother currents and reduced I(2)R loss - for some cables in the wind farm plant this is a reduction of more than 53%; (3) requirements or ratings of some equipment can be reduced - the capacitor and filtering circuits for the DC bus are no longer required and the ratings of some transformers can be reduced; (4) some complicated control can be simplified - the control for the grid-side converter under the current WIG scheme' is replaced by a simple battery charging/discharging algorithm; (5) the wind turbine plant will be more supportive to the grid; and from the grid point of view, the performance of the wind farms adopting the proposed BS2 scheme will be similar to and in certain aspects even better than that of power plants using fossil fuels; and (6) all the above will bring some economic benefits at the expense of some additional costs associated with using batteries. Some practical issues, including available space in a typical turbine tower, are also discussed. The simulation results presented, however, are limited to steady-state models. Further research will include the type of batteries to be used, more detailed dynamic studies and quantified analysis of economic benefits and costs.

AB With rapid development of wind power technologies and significant growth of wind power capacity installed worldwide, various wind turbine concepts have been developed. The wind energy conversion system is demanded to be more cost-competitive, so that comparisons of different wind generator systems are necessary. An overview of different wind generator systems and their comparisons are presented. First, the contemporary wind turbines are classified with respect to both their control features and drive train types, and their strengths and weaknesses are described. The promising permanent magnet generator types are also investigated. Then, the quantitative comparison and market penetration of different wind generator systems are presented. Finally, the developing trends of wind generator systems and appropriate comparison criteria are discussed. It is shown that variable speed concepts with power electronics will continue to dominate and be very promising technologies for large wind farms. The future success of different wind turbine concepts may strongly depend on their ability of complying with both market expectations and the requirements of grid utility companies.

AB Large variable-speed wind turbines with fully rated direct-in-line converters are increasingly used as silicon cost continues to decline. While grid codes require wind turbines to ride-through grid faults, including unbalanced faults, voltage source inverters interfaced to the grid are inherently sensitive to any unbalance in the ac voltage. This paper presents an unbalanced-grid-fault ride-through control method for such a wind turbine configuration. The method can be easily integrated into the power-tracking control needed during normal operation. It is shown that the major constraint is the second-order harmonic to be absorbed by the dc-link capacitor and that the control effectiveness depends on the voltage and current capabilities of the semiconductor devices in the inverter. Simulation and experimental results are used to validate the proposed control method and to identify the power limit that is necessary during ride-through.

Small signal models allow the formal analysis of the observers for a given dynamic. The performance of each MRAS observer is analyzed, considering grid-connected and stand-alone operation. The MRAS observers are implemented in a 3.5 kW experimental prototype composed of a doubly-fed induction generator and a wind turbine emulator. Experimental results validate the predictions of the small signal models and demonstrate the performance of the sensorless methods during both steady state and variable speed wind energy generation.

A specific design of the proposed control algorithm for a wind turbine equipped with a doubly fed induction generator (I)FIG) is presented. The aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine are approximated by a Gaussian radial basis function network based nonlinear input-output mapping. Based on this nonlinear mapping, the wind speed is estimated from the measured generator electrical output power while taking into account the power losses in the WTG and the dynamics of the WTG shaft system. The estimated wind speed is then used to determine the optimal DFIG rotor speed command for maximum wind power extraction. The DFIG speed controller is suitably designed to effectively damp the low-frequency torsional oscillations. The resulting WTG system delivers maximum electrical power to the grid with high efficiency and high reliability without mechanical anemometers. The validity of the proposed control algorithm is verified by simulation studies on a 3.6 MW WTG system. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed wind speed estimation algorithm is demonstrated by experimental studies on a small emulational WTG system.

ID SYSTEM
AB This paper quantifies the capability of providing a short-term excess active power support of a commercial multi-megawatt variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) and generalizes the findings by considering different wind turbine (WT) physical parameters in a wider range from the example case. The paper also identifies some possible applications of it, in particular, in a hydro dominated system. To be able to quantify the system characteristic, a delay model of the studied hydro system is developed. Due to the fact that the initial power surge of a hydro turbine is opposite to that desired, the short-term extra active power support from a wind farm (WF) could be beneficial for a hydro dominated system in arresting the initial frequency fall, which corresponds to an improvement in the system temporary minimum frequency (TMF). The improvements in the TMF are calculated by using both the developed delay model and a detailed model, and the results show good agreement. It is shown that the WT under consideration can provide a 0.1 pu extra active power support for 10 s quite easily which is twice the Hydro-Quebec requirement.

AB With an increased number of wind turbine generators (WTGs) connected to an electricity network the system operator may request that they participate in frequency control in the event of a sudden unbalancing of power generated and consumed on the system. In this paper the frequency response capability of the full converter variable speed wind turbine generator (FCWTG) with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is investigated. A control scheme is developed that improves the frequency control performance, illustrating the importance of the initial active power output of the FCWTG. A method of carefully ending the frequency support of a wind farm is proposed and simulated. The resulting frequency control performance compares favorably to that of a conventional synchronous generator plant.
