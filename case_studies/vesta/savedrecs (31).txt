AB In recent years, the small-scale wind power generation increases rapidly worldwide. The wind power depends on the wind speed, which is a random variable and is irregular. For efficient operation of wind power plants accurate short-term forecasts are essential. The knowledge of future power generation from wind turbines is useful for schedulers, transmission operators and energy traders. In this paper, wind speed and the power generation are predicted using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm -Neural hybrid system. The neural network is used in many prediction systems and it gives very successful results compared to other forecasting techniques like persistence, mean methods etc. At present many prediction systems are built with ANFIS but it is a more complex structure and not suitable for small scale wind power plants. The result of this hybrid system shows that it is more accurate and reliable for short term wind power forecasting. In this paper we have compared the results of hybrid model with the earlier available techniques like standard neural network and Genetic Neural Network for verification purpose.

AB The main contribution of this paper is the development of a nonlinear control technique for the control of individual wind turbines in a wind farm. For this purpose, a control scheme based on feedback linearization and gain scheduled linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is applied to a horizontal axis, variable speed, pitch regulated wind turbine. As a result of the physical constraints of their components, wind turbines operate at different control modes with different control objectives. To capture this hybrid nature, a flexible modeling framework based on the notion of hybrid systems is introduced, and the developed controller is designed so as to operate in all modes and over a wide range of wind speeds. The performance and the efficiency of the proposed approach is validated via simulations, and is compared with standard LQR approaches.

ID WAKES
AB The liquid-gas flow is proposed to accurately simulate the offshore environmental state. The aerodynamic feature is estimated using the three-dimensional model of horizontal-axis wind turbine with NRELS809 series aerofoil by means of the simulating software tool of FLUENT. The variable speed is implemented via the six different wind speeds. The calculated results show that the similarly evolutional tendency of velocity occurs in the wake region when operating at the six variable speeds. The stall speed is related to blade height and wind speed. The small blade height or large wind speed also leads to the serious stall phenomenon. The total force is conducted to estimate the potential capability for leeward and windward surface to capture wind power. The calculated results reveal that the larger wind speed facilitates generating the more magnitude of total force. However, the velocity and force feature for the wind turbine has the especially rapid change at the wind speed of 6 m/s, which perhaps results from the intrinsic geometry and configuration.

ID EXTRACTION ALGORITHM; WIND; SYSTEMS; MAXIMIZATION; INTEGRATION
AB This study presents a new operating scheme for variable speed wind/tidal stream turbines employing synchronous generators. Current maximum power tracking schemes for variable speed wind energy conversion systems rely on periodic comparison of the output power for guiding the direction of maximum power tracking or an online algorithm which continuously provides a generator torque/speed reference corresponding to the maximum power status at different wind speed conditions. The proposed scheme utilises only one-power-point on the maximum power curve. Once the information for the maximum power status of a local wind speed is known, then the wind energy conversion system implements maximum power tracking and constant power control for different wind speed conditions using simple control. The operation strategy is applicable to tidal stream turbines. Simulation results demonstrate the concept.

The detailed model, control parameters and operational characteristics of the SRG as well as variable-speed wind turbine are discussed. In order to drive the wind energy conversion system (WECS) to the point of maximum aerodynamic efficiency, a SRG power output feedback control strategy which optimized angle position-current chopping control cooperating PI regulator is proposed. The control strategy is also demonstrated by means of Matlab/Simulink. Moreover, an experimental test system is set up, which a cage induction machine is used to emulate the variable-speed wind turbine.

AB Kinematic accuracy of the pitch mechanism of a wind turbine was analyzed. The results show that the difference of the pitch angle and speed existed between the actual and theoretical value due to the elastic deformation of the parts and the hydraulic oil. Monitoring sensors were proposed, which was fixed on the blade plate and used to control the hydraulic cylinder motion and compensate the moving error. A file related with loads information of the key parts was created after motion simulation. After the file was input in ANSYS, the strength of the key parts was analyzed. Based on the results, the location, where the material was easy to yield or had the maximum stress, was found.

AB Numerical modeling and simulation of the NREL Phase VI Rotor operation was attempted using a commercial CFD code (ANSYS FLUENT (R) v12.1). The extensive experimental data that was collected at the NASA Ames Research Center 80' x 120' Wind Tunnel allowed a detailed evaluation of the numerical result, in order to asses the accuracy of the numerical modeling approach. Computations were performed only for the axial operating conditions, at constant RPM and variable wind speed. The SST k-omega turbulence model was applied for its reasonably accurate prediction of boundary layer separation under adverse pressure gradient. Results indicate that the model captures very well the occurrence of blade stall. The turbine torque is well predicted for lower wind speeds (pre-stall) but under predicted at higher wind speeds (deep blade stall).

AB The efficiency of a wind turbine is directly affected by the direction and the speed of the wind blowing towards the turbine blades. Considering the fact that wind blows from many directions with variable speeds, it would be seen that there is a requirement for designing new, optimized and highly efficient airfoils for wind turbines. This work is a preliminary work of an airfoil design project for wind turbines. Numerical analysis has been performed at high Reynolds number and low angles of attack (0 degrees <=alpha <= 20 degrees) for six different airfoils. Among the investigated airfoils, CLARK Y has been found to show the best performance considering the variation of C-L-alpha and C-L/C-D-alpha. In this study, where only steady computations have been performed, it has been seen that the validity of steady computations were limited up to different angles of attack for each airfoil. For the cases of higher angles, it was understood that the convergence of steady analyses was not achievable.

AB In this paper, the control scheme of a wind energy conversion system for remote sites using fuzzy logic is presented. Two fuzzy controllers are proposed: the first one is dedicated to the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of a variable speed permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbine. The second fuzzy controller has the the objective to manage both the production and the storage of electricity for optimum performances of the system in respecting load demand. Several simulation results are given to show the effectiveness and the good performances of the proposed control structure.

AB The paper examines two major implementations of inertial response in variable-speed wind turbine generators. Through time-domain simulations, these supplementary loops are compared based on their impact on grid frequency and the wind plant. Testing is performed on an isolated, hydro-dominated power system benchmark, to which a DFIG-based wind plant is connected. The results show that when these implementations are combined, with proper coordination, the resulting controller is capable of superior performance.

   farm; offshore wind farm; transient stability
AB This paper presents a co-operative control scheme for a small scale offshore wind and marine current farms composed of variable speed wind turbine driven doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) and fixed speed squirrel cage induction generators (IGs), respectively. One of the objectives of the proposed scheme is to reduce the overall cost due to the low cost of induction generator. However, induction generator has the stability problem as it requires large amount of reactive power to restore electromagnetic torque during grid disturbance. The proposed cooperative scheme will help marine current generators (IGs) in a marine current farm to provide necessary reactive power demand from their surrounding wind generators (DFIGs) resides in a offshore wind farm without installing additional reactive power compensating devices (STATCOM/SVC). Optimum capacities of wind and marine current farms that can be used in proposed scheme to augment the stability of both farms are also determined, in this study. Different types of fault conditions are examined and the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by using laboratory standard power system simulator PSCAD/EMTDC.

AB Fixed speed wind turbine generator system that uses induction generator (IG) has the stability problem similar to the step-out phenomenon of a synchronous generator during grid fault. On the other hand, doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) can control its real and reactive powers independently while being operated in variable speed mode. This paper proposes a new control strategy using DFIGs for stabilizing wind farms composed of DFIGs and IGs, without incorporating additional FACTS devices. A new control scheme of limiting the rotor current of the DFIGs during grid fault was proposed. Simulation analysis by using PSCAD/EMTDC shows that the DFIGs can effectively stabilize the IGs and hence the entire wind farms through the proposed control scheme by providing sufficient reactive power to the system.

The proposed adaptation strategy consists on updating the sliding gain and the turbine torque, which is considered unknown by the controller. The adaptation algorithms for the sliding gain and the torque estimation are carried out using the sliding surface to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional sliding mode control. The objective is to track a speed profile to operate the wind turbine in maximum power extraction. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control system.

AB This paper presents a grid connected variable-speed micro hydropower plant, based on a micro Axial-flow turbine (semi-Kaplan) coupled to permanent magnet synchronous generator (MHPP-PMSG); Two back-to-back Voltage Source Inverters are interfacing the generator. The main idea is to show the feasibility and interest of variable speed operation of the considered system. The scope of the presented work is similar to that used for wind and tidal generators. A MPPT algorithm (perturb & Observe) is used for controlling the MHPP-PMSG for optimizing the operating efficiency by finding the optimal rotation speed. PI controllers are used to control the power electronics interface converters and DC-link voltage. The proposed scheme of MHPP-PMSG has been simulated under Matlab Simulink and the results obtained show the benefit of variable speed for micro hydropower.

AB To reduce the cost of wind energy, minimization and prediction of maintenance operations in wind turbine is of key importance. In variable speed turbine generator, advanced signal processing tools are required to detect and diagnose the generator faults from the stator current. To detect a fault in non-stationary conditions, previous studies have investigated the use of time-frequency techniques such as the Spectrogram, the Wavelet transform, the Wigner-Ville representation and the Hilbert-Huang transform. In this paper, these techniques are presented and compared for broken-rotor bar detection in squirrel-cage generators. The comparison is based on several criteria such as the computational complexity, the readability of the representation and the easiness of interpretation.

AB Grid connected wind turbines are fluctuating power sources due to wind speed variations, the wind shear and the tower shadow effects. The fluctuating power may be able to excite the power system oscillation at a frequency close to the natural oscillation frequency of a power system. This paper presents a simulation model of a variable speed wind farm with permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) and full-scale back-to-back converters in the simulation tool of DIgSILENT/PowerFactory. In this paper, the impacts of wind shear and tower shadow effects on the small signal stability of power systems with large scale wind power penetrations are investigated during continuous operation based on the wind turbine model and the power system model.

ID GENERATION SYSTEM; TURBINE SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents a wind speed sensorless maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller for variable speed wind energy conversion systems (WECS). The proposed controller generates at its output the optimum speed (OS) command for the speed control loop of the vector controlled machine side converter control system without requiring the knowledge of wind speed. The MPPT control of the WECS is achieved using optimum speed-power curve of the WECS taking into account the variation of the system efficiency while operating at various operating points due to the change in wind speed. The method is based on the fact that the optimum output power of a WECS at a certain wind speed depends upon the total mechanical power developed by the turbine and efficiency of the WECS at the corresponding OS of rotation of the turbine. The controller algorithm implementation requires the knowledge of turbine parameters and output power and air density as its inputs. The proposed concept is analyzed in a variable speed direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) WECS. Experimental results show good tracking capability of the proposed controller.

AB A simple near-unity power factor converter using two current control methods-the Average Current Control method (ACC) and Hysteresis Current Control method (HCC) has been employed in this paper for a wind energy conversion system feeding simple loads. A simple stepped wind speed profile, comprising the rated wind speed and a higher wind speed, has been considered and the performance parameters of the unity power factor converter compared for these two current control methods. The wind turbine drives a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG), which is interfaced with the near UPF converter feeding a resistive load. The performance parameters under study are the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the input currents to the converter and the input Power Factor (PF) to the converter. Simulation has been performed in PSIM and Simulink employing SimCoupler for co-simulation and the results verify the efficacy of the converter in delivering satisfactory performance.

AB This paper presents a novel control strategy for a high penetrated wind based hybrid Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system. The proposed RAPS system consists of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind turbine and a battery energy storage system with a dump load for DC bus voltage control and a diesel generator as a back-up supply. An integrated control approach based on active and reactive power balance of the proposed RAPS system has been proposed and developed with a view to regulate the voltage and frequency within an acceptable bandwidth. The proposed integrated control algorithm is implemented by developing controller for the individual system components in the RAPS system including wind energy conversion system, diesel generator, battery storage and dump load while coordinating their responses to achieve optimal operation. The optimised operation for the proposed RAPS system is realised by operating the wind turbine generator on its maximum power extraction mode while restricting the operation of diesel generating system at low-load conditions. In addition to the detailed model, which associated with non-linear high order characteristic of each system components, a linearlised model of the RAPS system is presented with a view to compare the active power sharing among the system components. The suitability of the proposed control strategy has been tested under varying system conditions including fluctuating wind and variable load.

AB Wind energy has good potential for reducing the environmental impact and cost of electricity generation in diesel based stand-alone systems (mini-grids). However, due to the stochastic nature of wind and the highly variable loads typical of remote communities, the diesel power plants can be subject to significant variation in the power demand. This can create large variations in the grid frequency and also make the diesel gensets operate at low load what can lead to carbon build up in the engines and increased maintenance costs. Some power electronic based wind turbines can provide frequency support to mitigate these problems but might be too costly for operation in small mini-grids. Conversely, there is the fixed-pitch fixed-speed induction generator based (type 1) wind turbine which does not allow any active control but presents low capital and maintenance costs. In this paper, an approach for obtaining the power vs. grid frequency characteristics of a type 1 wind turbine is described and validated experimentally. It shows that the power injected into the grid by a type 1 wind turbine reduces as the grid frequency increases. Therefore, it can help with frequency regulation in a passive way.

AB This paper presents the development, implementation and performance testing of a new permanent magnet generator-based wind energy conversion system for grid-connected applications. The grid-connected operation is constructed using the new three phase resolution-level controlled wavelet modulated inverter. The output of the wind generator is fed to a switch-mode converter, where the dc voltage is controlled to ensure extracting the maximum power at each wind speed. The resolution-level control of the grid-side inverter is designed as a current controller for adjusting active and reactive powers delivered to the grid. The proposed wind energy conversion system is implemented both in software and hardware performance testing on a direct-drive 6 kW laboratory permanent magnet generator operated with variable speed. Test results demonstrate that an accurate control of the dc voltage on the generator side ensures adjusting the generator speed to extract the maximum power from the wind at each wind speed. Also, test results show significant abilities of the resolution-level controller to initiate fast and accurate adjustments in the output active and reactive powers to meet the demand values under variable wind speed.

ID ENERGY-CONVERSION; TURBINE SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB Variable-speed wind power systems are able to vary the rotor speed according to wind speed variation. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is the key to notably improve efficiency of such energy extraction systems. The characteristic power curve MPPT method is one of the popular MPPT methods. It does not need real-time wind speed measurement and by using the relationship between power and current, the reference current can be obtained easily. This paper presents the steady state and dynamic analyses of this MPPT method and proposes a single pole transfer function to describe the effect of variation of wind speed on the rotor speed. This is conducted by applying the small signal analysis on the turbine-rotor mechanical system. To verify the performances of wind turbine system, both simulation and experimental systems are implemented based on MPPT power control. By concentrating on step wind speed variation, all results - proposed theory, simulation and experiments - present good consistency.

DE Grid connected; back-to-back converter; SCIG; wind turbine
AB This paper presents a grid connected squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) driven by a back-to-back converter in variable speed wind turbine system. The back-to-back converter is composed of the machine side converter coupling to the line side connected together via DC bus capacitor. Both converters used the vector control and decoupling control in the d-, q-axis reference frame. The control objectives of the machine side converter are to optimize the energy capture from the wind and supply the excitation flux to the SCIG whereas the objectives of line side converter are to deliver the energy from the machine side to the utility grid and to regulate the DC bus voltage. The experiments in this paper are tested with a 5.5 kW SCIG coupled with a 7.5 kW wind turbine simulator. The experimental results show the high-quality control performance during dynamic and steady state conditions. Moreover for the grid side, the line current has low total harmonic distortion (THD) and a reactive power can be controlled at a unity power factor.

AB For the control target of capturing maximum power for variable speed wind turbine when the wind speed is below the rated wind speed, a switching "optimal" tracking controller of the generator angular velocity is designed. First, the generator optimal angular velocity is identified by using dynamic fuzzy neural network. Then a generator angular velocity optimal tracking controller is designed by using different system parameters in different angular velocity range based on switching control. The ideal of the control is by controlling the voltage of the generator rotor to adjust the generator angular velocity, so it can track the optimal angular velocity. By simulation its result shows that the controller makes the system track the optimal angular velocity, and so realizes maximum wind power capture.

   This paper presents a new converter topology for interfacing a permanent magnet synchronous generator based variable speed wind turbine with a residential power network. Analysis of the converter topologies studied earlier shows that they are not well suited for PMSG with low output voltage. PMSG characteristics are discussed in order to formulate requirements for a power converter. A new topology of an interfacing converter is analyzed and simulation results of a lossless model are presented. Simulation results of the proposed converter prove that its utilization in wind power applications is beneficial. The results of performance tests demonstrate the SL qZSI ability to ensure the required sinusoidal output voltage at all operation modes of PMSG-based WSVT.

A protection system is used to disconnect the WTs from the grid when the controller is unable to compensate the voltage variations. Simulations carried out on a real 37-bus Italian weak distribution network demonstrated that the controller allows compensating voltage variations during voltage sags.

AB Soft computing techniques are important tools that significantly improve the performance of energy systems. This chapter reviews their many contributions to renewable energy hydrogen hybrid systems, namely those systems that consist of different technologies (photovoltaic and wind, electrolyzers, fuel cells, hydrogen storage, piping, thermal and electrical/electronic control systems) capable as a whole of converting solar energy, storing it as chemical energy (in the form of hydrogen) and turning it back into electrical and thermal energy.
   Fuzzy logic decision-making methodologies can be applied to select amongst renewable energy alternative or to vary a dump load for regulating wind turbine speed or find the maximum power point available from arrays of photovoltaic modules. Dynamic fuzzy logic controllers can furthermore be utilized to coordinate the flow of hydrogen to fuel cells or employed for frequency control in micro-grid power systems.
   Neural networks are implemented to model, design and control renewable energy systems and to estimate climatic data such as solar irradiance and wind speeds. They have been demonstrated to predict with good accuracy system power usage and status at any point of time. Neural controls can also help in the minimization of energy production costs by optimal scheduling of power units.
   Genetic or evolutionary algorithms are able to provide approximate solutions to several complex tasks with high number of variables and non-linearities, like optimal operational strategy of a grid-parallel fuel cell power plant, optimization of control strategies for stand-alone renewable systems and sizing of photovoltaic systems.
   Particle swarm optimization techniques are applied to find optimal sizing of system components in an effort to minimize costs or coping with system failures to improve service quality.
   These techniques can also be implemented together to exploit their potential synergies while, at the same time, coping with their possible limitations.
   This chapter covers soft computing methods applied to renewable energy hybrid hydrogen systems by providing a description of their single or mixed implementation and relevance, together with a discussion of advantages and/or disadvantages in their applications.

ID LOAD REDUCTION; COMPOSITE; PITCH
AB The loads on wind turbine components are primarily from the blades. It is important to control these blade loads in order to avoid damaging the wind turbine. Rotor control technology is currently limited to controlling the rotor speed and the pitch of the blades. As blades increase in length it becomes less desirable to pitch the entire blade as a single rigid body, but instead there is a requirement to control loads more precisely along the length of the blade. This can be achieved with aerodynamic control devices such as flaps. Morphing technologies are good candidates for wind turbine flaps because they have the potential to create structures that have the conflicting abilities of being load carrying, light-weight and shape adaptive. A morphing flap design with a highly anisotropic cellular structure is presented which is able to undergo large deflections and high strains without a large actuation penalty. An aeroelastic analysis couples the work done by aerodynamic loads on the flap, the flap strain energy and the required actuation work to change shape. The morphing flap is experimentally validated with a manufactured demonstrator and shown to have reduced actuation requirements compared to a conventional hinged flap.

AB The physical design space of a wind-battery system enables a system designer to understand the trade-offs between different system design variables, the physical limits of the major decision variables, and arrive at an optimum solution subject to an appropriate design objective. An improved methodology for design of isolated wind-battery systems by accounting for the uncertainty associated with wind speed is proposed in this article. Chance-constraint programming technique is used to incorporate resource uncertainty in system sizing; thereby, facilitating system design corresponding to a specified reliability requirement. It is found that the cut-in speed of the wind turbine plays a critical role in delivering desired power supply reliability. A feasible design solution is obtained only when the probabilities associated with the cut-in and the cut-off wind speeds are accounted for along with the specified system reliability requirement. All feasible combination of system variables generated through a time-series simulation are represented on a rotor diameter versus generator rating diagram with minimum battery bank size as parameter. Solutions obtained by the proposed method are validated by sequential Monte Carlo simulations. Optimum system configuration for a given reliability requirement is determined based on minimum cost of energy (US$/kWh). It is shown that wind-battery systems cannot be designed to provide power supply reliability beyond a maximum value.

AB 1MW variable speed constant frequency wind turbine tower of steel structure is analyzed by using the software ANSYS, the coupling between the wind and the tower is realized through the order coupling method. The maximum Von Mises stress and the deformation of the tower in the case of limit loads are obtained, and then these results are compared with that without wind load. Comparison result shows that the effect of wind load on the tower's displacement along the wind speed is great, and the maximum Von Mises stress of the tower becomes larger after considering the influence of wind load, the increase extent is determined by wind load case.

AB Purpose - Wind-diesel sets offered as a reliable hybrid isolated power systems with reduction of fuel consumption, consists of variable speed wind turbines and fixed speed diesel engines. Load and wind energy variations cause, that the load power of the diesel genset is varied in wide range. Fixed speed generation set operates with the best efficiency only in a narrow range of the load, therefore implementation of a load adaptive, adjustable speed genset may additionally reduce fuel consumption.
   Design/methodology/approach - Analysis of the system components model, simulation and laboratory tests on a small-scale model.
   Findings - Topology and output voltage control method of four-wire adjustable speed autonomous wind-diesel system dedicated for isolated power plants with high wind penetration.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper presents only part of the work which has to be done for the complete system. Load and energy management has to be applied in standalone system, as not in each operating point of proposed wind-diesel system, can rated load be supplied. To fully prove the proposed system and control concept, tests of megawatt range system are advisable. To evaluate the fuel saving, a real wind and load profile in a selected isolated place is needed.
   Practical implications - Every adjustable speed generation systems can save fuel. However, proposed topology in main part consists of known and implemented solutions, therefore costs of the new installation will not be increased significantly.
   Originality/value - Proposed costs effective topology of adjustable speed wind-diesel generation system has not been presented by any other authors. Standalone operation of doubly fed induction generator system is rarely reported in the papers.

AB The noise measurement case presented in this work took place in August 2007 in a small community located on the Finnish west coast, where an 1X1 MW pitch regulated variable speed wind turbine caused many complaints from the nearby holiday residents after its initial start-up in 2006. New specific receiver testing procedures were introduced prior to the test for performing just one overnight measurement under desired weather conditions. The goal was to test the sound power level and outdoor far field sound pressure levels at receiver point, including the verification of narrow band and impulsive sounds, during the night time and downwind conditions.

AB In this paper, a new variable-speed wind energy conversion system (WECS) with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), Vienna rectifier and three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter is proposed. Vienna rectifier is used for flux vector control of PMSG, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of wind turbine, PMSG efficiency optimization, and balancing of two rectified DC voltages. As power conditioner, a three-level NPC inverter is used to deliver energy to the grid. Vector control of the inverter provides the ability to regulate power factor to any desired value. The results of two simulations (for back-to-back inverter and the proposed topology) are presented and compared. The results verify improved efficiency of the proposed WECS compared to WECS using back-to-back inverter. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The individual pitch drive system of large-scale wind turbines was analysed in this article. In this pitch system, the induction motor, three-stage planetary gearbox, and motor vector control were adopted. In order to investigate the system dynamic behaviour, its non-linear dynamical model was established, mainly including three parts: induction motor model in d-q frame, dynamic model of three-stage planetary gears, and transmission shaft model. The dynamic responses of gearbox-blade subsystem and motor-gearbox-blade system were analysed in detail, respectively. Then, the pitch system control model was established in which rotor flux field-oriented vector control and double close-loop servo control with speed and position feedback were employed. In simulation, the algorithm TR-BDF2 was adopted to solve the dynamic equations. The research results show that the deviation between the pitch angle and its command value is very small in steady state, pitch speed and acceleration fluctuations appear when impact effect is produced due to gear backlash, and the different blade may have different variable pitch speed and acceleration in some pitch region. The research results give a reasonable explanation for running mechanism of the individual pitch system and are helpful for optimization design and control for the individual blade pitch control system used in large-scale wind turbines.

AB The power electronics plays an important role in the reliable operation of a modern wind energy conversion system (WECS). This study aims at the grid interconnection of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based wind turbine with harmonics and reactive power compensation capability at the point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed system consists of two back-to-back connected converters with a common dc-link. The generator-side converter is used to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The grid-side converter is actively controlled to feed generated power as well as to supply the harmonics and reactive power demanded by the non-linear load at PCC, thus enabling the grid to supply only sinusoidal current at unity power factor. A model of directly driven PMSG-based variable speed WECS is developed and simulated in MATLAB/SPS environment. The effectiveness of proposed control approach is validated through extensive simulation and experimental results.

TI ESTONIAN WIND FARMS' NEED FOR FULL BALANCE POWER
SO OIL SHALE
LA English
DT Article
ID FORECAST
AB Estonia had set a target to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the energy production up to 5.1% of total consumption by the end of 2010. There are no large rivers and solar activity is also low in Estonia. Therefore one of the biggest possibilities to achieve that target is to use bio fuels and wind power. Approximately 90% of total electricity is generated from oil shale, hereby oil shale power plants have to cover wind energy deficits. Wind speed is very variable and therefore electric power production by wind turbines varies from zero to nominal power. This is a problem for the power grid.
   The current paper analyses whether wind turbines and wind farms need 100% balanced power. Wind data of four weather stations around Estonia were investigated. Wind speeds were calculated to 100 meters above the ground level and Weibull distributions were composed. Distribution and duration of zero energy periods were analysed.
   In 2008 zero wind production periods varied from 1 to 7 hours (63 times) and their sum was 137 hours. In these periods wind turbines need 100% balance power.

AB This article presents a method for harmonic mitigation and maximum power point tracking for a variable-speed grid-connected 20-kW wind turbine. The wind energy conversion system consists of a permanent magnet synchronous generator driven by variable-speed 20-kW wind turbine. The output of the permanent magnet synchronous generator is connected to a single-switch three-phase boost rectifier to generate DC voltage, which feeds a current-controlled inverter to interface the system with the electric utility. The single-switch three-phase boost rectifier is an active power factor correction technique to maintain the power factor at the permanent magnet synchronous generator side to nearly unity and mitigate the permanent magnet synchronous generator current harmonics. To mitigate inverter output current and voltage harmonics, an LCL filter has been used. A complete analysis of the harmonic content has been done everywhere in the system. The results show that the proposed maximum power point tracking control strategy succeeded to track the maximum wind power irrespective of the wind speed. This strategy in presence of an LCL filter achieved harmonic mitigation at the permanent magnet synchronous generator and inverter output sides. The dynamic response of the wind energy conversion system is tested under a three-phase fault condition. For comparison purposes, an active power filter is designed and checked against the single-switch three-phase boost rectifier for harmonic mitigation at the permanent magnet synchronous generator side.

AB Power converters play a vital role in the integration of wind power into the electrical grid. Variable-speed wind turbine generator systems have a considerable interest of application for grid connection at constant frequency. In this paper, comprehensive simulation studies are carried out with three power converter topologies: matrix, two-level and multilevel. A fractional-order control strategy is studied for the variable-speed operation of wind turbine generator systems. The studies are in order to compare power converter topologies and control strategies. The studies reveal that the multilevel converter and the proposed fractional-order control strategy enable an improvement in the power quality, in comparison with the other power converters using a classical integer-order control strategy.

AB This paper presents an optimized wind energy harvesting (WEH) system that uses a specially designed ultra-low-power-management circuit for sustaining the operation of a wireless sensor node. The proposed power management circuit has two distinct features: 1) an active rectifier using MOSFETs for rectifying the low amplitude ac voltage generated by the wind turbine generator under low wind speed condition efficiently and 2) a dc-dc boost converter with resistor emulation algorithm to perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under varying wind-speed conditions. As compared to the conventional diode-bridge rectifier, it is shown that the efficiency of the active rectifier with a low input voltage of 1.2 V has been increased from 40% to 70% due to the significant reduction in the ON-state voltage drop (from 0.6 to 0.15 V) across each pair of MOSFETs used. The proposed robust low-power microcontroller-based resistance emulator is implemented with closed-loop resistance feedback control to ensure close impedance matching between the source and the load, resulting in an efficient power conversion. From the experimental test results obtained, an average electrical power of 7.86 mW is harvested by the optimized WEH system at an average wind speed of 3.62 m/s, which is almost four times higher than the conventional energy harvesting method without using the MPPT.

AB One of the major challenges to supporting, facilitating and developing wind generated power is matching supply and demand. Wind generated power is obviously subject to fluctuations due to variation in the wind. There is also a shutdown mechanism which is employed when the wind becomes very strong which prevents damage to the turbines. Thus, when the wind is light or very strong, there is no power generated. Predicting the output from the turbines is currently an important research topic.
   In the past, time series analysis and other methods have been employed in order to better understand the nature of the data. These include ARMA and GARCH models as well as relatively new methods of detrended fluctuation analysis, (Ward et al., 2009; Boland et al., 2009; Magnano and Boland, 2007; Kavasseri and Nagarajan, 2004). The behaviour of complex time series, as is the wind farm power output, and as is seen in the financial sector has been and is currently well researched. Some of these time series have been found to be non-linear, stochastic and chaotic, and are notoriously difficult to model. There is evidence however, that there could be some scaling behaviour apparent in these series (Weron and Przybylowicz, 2000).
   The particular objective of this project is to reduce the error in predicting the power supply generated by wind farms (or the individual turbines) five minutes into the future so that the power company is able to guarantee the promised power. Currently this is not possible due to the financial risks involved in not delivering the guaranteed amount. Apart from climatic research, there is not much in the way of research into spatial correlations where records are available of similar variables at different locations. Since the temporal nature of the time series is currently being thoroughly investigated by many researchers, this study explores the possible spatial correlations between wind farms.
   This paper describes the investigation into the spatial correlation between five South Australian wind farms using empirical orthogonal function analysis, (EOF). If there is spatial correlation between farms, this can be used to better predict what might happen at one farm based upon what has happened at a different farm at some earlier time. There has also been speculation among experts that power output of sites along a weather front behave in a similar way.
   One of the main difficulties with determining the power output of wind turbines is that wind speed is not a useful predictor. The wind speed isn't actually measured at the height of the blades and if instruments were installed the to measure the wind speed immediately in front of the turbine blades, then the likelihood of correct measurements would be compromised by their existence.
   This study has focused on the spatial correlations between farms and the initial results from this study indicate that there is evidence of some spatial correlation between some of the farms.

AB Pitch system is a complicated nonlinear system disturbed by many uncertainties and is a key part of wind turbine system. When wind speed exceeds rated cut-in speed, pitch angle is changed to control wind power conversion efficiency, thus capturing rated power from wind and protecting wind turbine from damage. In this paper, based on the analysis of wind turbine aerodynamic, an active disturbance rejection based pitch controller for variable speed wind turbine is presented to improve performance of key turbine variables including pitch angle, turbine rotor speed, and power output. Based on turbine rotor speed feedback, an extended state observer is designed to estimate state variables and disturbances. To verify the performance of the proposed controller, simulations for different turbulent winds are carried out. Simulation results show high performance of proposed scheme for high-precision control of pitch angle.

AB Pitch-control is a main method to maintain the output power stable when wind speed above the rated in Large and medium-sized variable pitch wind turbine generator. Because wind turbine generator is a complex nonlinear system of multi-interference and strong coupling, traditional pitch controller can not satisfactorily solve the problems of low convergence speed and large steady-state error. A new type of pitch optimization control method based on Action Dependent Heuristic Dynamic Programming method is provided in this paper, at the same time the principle of the algorithm and design steps of the controller are introduced, then the simulation experiments with a 1.5MW wind turbine generator and compared with the traditional PID control method are given. Simulation results show that output power can maintain the rated when wind speed above rated with the new pitch control strategy. It can effectively reduce system's overshoot and setting time, and has a satisfactory performance.

   network controller; Feed forward control
AB In order to solve nonlinear, multi-disturb and time lag problem of wind turbine generator (WTG), a pitch control of variable speed constant frequency wind turbines based on neural network is investigated after analyzing characteristics of WTG and requisitions of pitch control. In this approach, by application of neural network model identification, model predictive control and feed forward control are distinguishingly executed. So it both solves the problem of modeling WTG, and erases the influence of the main interference, variable wind speed, on control quality. As a result, it enhances rapidity and anti-interference capability of pitch system. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and practical.
