AB The foundation of a new topology for a fully variable speed hybrid wind/diesel power system has been modelled in Matlab Simulink. Use of the variable speed diesel generator is shown to increase fuel savings over a constant speed generator in a hybrid system. The load matching capabilities of the variable speed diesel generator to wind speed drops in the hybrid system are then assessed. Finally integration of a variable speed wind turbine and new variable speed diesel generator through the DC-link stage of an AC/DC/AC power converter has been simulated to establish compatibility.

AB Owing to the instability of wind load, the output power of the generator is variable. In order to solve this problem, the speed-up gearbox-DF generator system or straight drive-transducer system is adopted by the. traditional operation, which is low efficiency, large volume, heavy in weight and high cost. An original transmission system is explored. The differential transmission system consists of a mechanical drive system, a hydraulic speed adjusting system and a constant-speed generator, which translate wind wheel speed of mainshaft from variable to constant. In this design, the maximum power of wind energy is captured, and the vibration and noise are cutted. This transmission system is characterized by compact conformation, compactness, light in weight, convenient transport and hoisting.

AB This paper presents a new synchronization algorithm for grid connection of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) in a variable speed wind generation system. Stator flux-oriented vector control with back-to-back PWM converters in the DFIG rotor circuit is used for synchronization process. By controlling the rotor d-axis current, the magnitude of the stator EW is adjusted to be equal to the grid voltage. PLL circuit is used to compensate for the phase shift between the stator EMF and the grid voltage. By controlling the turbine pitch angle, the generator speed is determined to adjust the stator frequency to be equal to the grid. Simulation results using PSCAD show a smooth synchronization and fast dynamic responses.

AB This study proposes a development for the 1-kW class small wind turbine system, which is applicable to relatively low wind speed regions like Korea and has the variable pitch control mechanism. In the aerodynamic design of the wind turbine blade, parametric studies were carried out to determine an optimum aerodynamic configuration which is not only more efficient at low wind speed but whose diameter is not much larger than similar class other blades. A light composite structure, which can endure effectively various loads, was newly designed. In order to evaluate the structural design of the composite blade, the structural analysis was performed by the finite element method. Moreover both structural safety and aerodynamic performance were verified through the prototype test.

AB This paper describes the cycloidal wind turbine, which is a straight blade vertical axis wind turbine using the cycloidal blade system. Cycloidal blade system consists of several blades rotating about an axis in parallel direction, and each blade periodically changes its pitch angle. Cycloidal wind turbine is different from the previous turbines. It operates with optimum rotating forces by actively controlling the blade to change pitch angle and phase angle according to the changes of wind direction and wind speed.
   Various numerical experiments were conducted to develop a small vertical axis wind turbine of the 3 kW class. For this numerical analysis, the rotor system had four blades consisting of a symmetric airfoil NACA0018 of 2m in span, 0.45m in chord and 1.6m in radius. A general purpose commercial CFD program, STAR-CD, was used for numerical analysis, and PCL of MSC/PATRAN was used for efficient parametric auto mesh generation. Variables of wind speed, pitch angle, phase angle and rotating speed were set in the numerical experiments. The generated power was obtained according to the various combinations of these variables. Optimal pitch angle and phase angle of cycloidal blade system were obtained according to the change of the wind direction and the wind speed.
   Based on data obtained from the above analysis, control device, which is the most important part of a developing system, was designed. The wind direction and the wind speed were sensed by the wind indicator and the anemometer, and each blade was actuated to optimal performance values by servo motors.

DE vertical axis wind turbine; individual active control; cycloidal blade
   system; straight blade
AB In this paper, a research for the performance improvement of the straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine is described. To improve the performance of the power generation system, which consists of several blades rotating about axis in parallel direction, the cycloidal blade system and the individual active blade control system are adopted, respectively. Both methods are variable pitch system. For cycloidal wind turbine, aerodynamic analysis is carried out by changing pitch angle and phase angle based on the cycloidal motion according to the change of wind speed and wind direction, and control mechanism using the cycloidal blade system is realized for 1kw class wind turbine. By this method, electrical power is generated about 30% higher than wind turbine using fixed pitch angle method. And for more efficient wind turbine, individual pitch angle control of each blade is studied. By maximizing the tangential force in each rotating blade at the specific rotating position, optimal pitch angle variation is obtained. And several airfoil shapes of NACA 4-digit and NACA 6-series are studied. Aerodynamic analysis shows performance improvement of 60%. To realize this motion, sensing and actuating system is designed.

DE variable speed wind turbine generator system; fuzzy control; simulation
AB To maintain the optimum blade tip speed ratio in order to obtain the maximum wind energy under lower wind speed, and to store or deliver some energy in order to enhance the flexibility of gear system and get stable output of power under higher wind speed, the angular speed of wind wheel is mainly used to control the variable speed wind turbine generator system. Building the accurate mathematical model of the wind turbine generator system is very difficult because of the uncertainty of air kinetics and the complexity of power electronics. To simplify and avoid the sophisticated mathematical model, fuzzy controller was designed to control the rotation moment of wind wheel and the reverse moment of the generator. The simulation model and results are obtained. Compared with the PID controller, using fuzzy controller the variable speed wind turbine generator system can get smooth output and has better anti-interference property.

AB Novel brushless doubly-fed wind turbine was used to solve two key problems of maximum power transfer and power quality control. The frequency, amplitude, phase angle as well as phase sequence of brushless doubly-fed generator were regulated by power converter based on DSP control. A sort of fuzzy controller was designed to gain maximum power transfer and variable speed constant frequency by controlling generator speed to gain optimum tip-speed-ratio as low wind speed. Another kind of fuzzy adaptive controller was designed to gain constant out power and frequency by controlling the pitch angle and wind turbine rotation speed to adjust tip-speed-ratio as higher than normal wind speed. The simulation results were given.
