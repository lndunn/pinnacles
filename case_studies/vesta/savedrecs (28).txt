AB This work explores the contribution of variable-speed wind turbines on two typical problems of multimachine power systems: the frequency regulation and the inter-area oscillations. Towards this end, a multimachine test system is augmented with a variable-speed wind farm. Two additional control loops are included in order to modify the active power delivered by the wind farm in response to frequency deviations and inter-area oscillations. Some guidelines are given to achieve a suitable tuning of the loop gains. In case of the inter-area oscillation compensator, the analysis is carried out for different loading conditions, measurement time delays and input signals.

AB Renewable Distributed Generation (RDG), such as production of electric power near to the load, is particularly beneficial when the distribution network is "weak" against specific demands, as in potable water production systems connected to coastal electrification networks. In these areas, the wind resource may be suitable for this type of generation. This work proposes the topology, the operation mode and the control strategy for a Reverse Osmosis Desalination Plant, "assisted" by a weak AC grid and "powered" by a variable speed wind turbine based on a three-phase BDFIG machine. The wind energy conversion is optimized through adequate control of the generator. The high pressure pump of the desalination plant is controlled for the maximum utilization of the generated power. The electric power fluctuations due to win turbulence are compensated through a controlled energy storage system based on a flywheel. The system configuration, its operation mode and control are presented.

AB This paper proposes a trustworthy and practical approach to predict wind speed, which could be used as input to predict wind power generation. In the prediction model, we applied the variable speed wind as input of this model. Then the Gaussian noise is added to the input due to existing of noise in measuring of wind speed. Kalman filtering is used as the prediction method in this study. The parameters of shaping filter are calculated using power spectral analysis and Gauss-Markov theory. Results under different time horizon of prediction are compared with actual data and the comparison shows that the results obtained using Kalman filter is reliable. The proposed method works well for an hour ahead prediction and for short-time prediction works even better. The application of Kalman filter on wind speed prediction is implemented in MATLAB software and results are provided in this paper.

AB In recent years, due to the rising penetration of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) into the electricity networks, increasingly comprehensive studies and accurate dynamic models are required to analyze its behavior under grid faults. A complete model of a pitch-controlled variable-speed wind turbine driven by a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and its control scheme are implemented. All encompassed subsystems, such as wind turbine, pitch actuator, two-mass drive train model, DFIG model, converters and protections are modeled in FORTRAN using the power system simulation software PSS/E. A cascade control structure is used where the outer control loop concerns the speed control and the inner control loop is responsible for the electrical control. Additionally, a frequency control support is developed in order to accomplish with the Grid Codes requirements enhancing the grid power quality. The model performance under various system disturbances is tested by means of simulations.

AB Online fault diagnosis is an effective means to improve wind turbine reliability and performance and reduce wind turbine operating and maintenance costs. Current-based fault diagnosis techniques have received more and more attention in academia and industry due to their nonintrusive character and economic advantages. This paper presents an algorithm based on power spectral density (PSD) analysis for bearing fault signature extraction of direct-drive wind turbines by only using stator current measurements. An impulse detection method is then applied to screen out the excitations in the PSD spectrum, where the excitations at the characteristic frequencies of the bearing fault are extracted as the fault signature. A median filter-based method is then designed to evaluate the physical condition of the wind turbine based on the extracted fault signature to determine whether maintenance is required. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for bearing faults diagnosis of a direct-drive wind turbine operating at variable-speed conditions.

AB The objective of this paper is to analyze and quantify the inertia and frequency responses of wind power plants with different wind turbine technologies (particularly those of fixed speed, variable slip with rotor-resistance controls, and variable speed with vector controls). The fundamental theory, the operating range, and the modifications needed for the wind turbine to contribute to the inertial and primary frequency response during the frequency drop will be presented in this paper. We will demonstrate practical approaches to allow variable slip and speed wind turbines to contribute inertia to the host power system grid. The approaches are based on the inclusion of frequency error and the rate of change of frequency signals in the torque control loop and pitch control actions for wind speeds below and above its rated value. Detailed simulation models in the time domain will be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the approaches.

AB Maintaining the frequency within certain limits in a power system is a basic operational requirement as many loads may be very sensitive to frequency deviations. Increasing wind penetration in the power grid may lead to stability problems in isolated systems, or systems with weak interconnections with surrounding areas. Modern wind farms are based on variable speed wind turbines where the rotor speed and the electrical frequency are not coupled, thus, these farms do not add inertia to the system. At certain levels of wind penetration, the system inertia may become critically small, and the system may get unstable. In this work, some frequency response capabilities are incorporated into a wind farm. A validated wind model, developed by the authors, is used to obtain the wind series which is used for the simulations. Typical models of conventional generation power plants are used to fulfill the system operation requirements.

AB The global rise in energy demands brings major obstacles to many energy organizations in providing adequate energy supply. Hence, many techniques to generate cost effective, reliable and environmentally friendly alternative energy source are being explored. One such method is the integration of photovoltaic cells, wind turbine generators and fuel-based generators, included with storage batteries. This sort of power systems are known as distributed generation (DG) power system. However, the application of DG power systems raise certain issues such as cost effectiveness, environmental impact and reliability. The modelling as well as the optimization of this DG power system was successfully performed in the previous work using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The central idea of that work was to minimize cost, minimize emissions and maximize reliability (multi-objective (MO) setting) with respect to the power balance and design requirements. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy model that takes into account the uncertain nature of certain variables in the DG system which are dependent on the weather conditions (such as; the insolation and wind speed profiles). The MO optimization in a fuzzy environment was performed by applying the Hopfield Recurrent Neural Network (HNN). Analysis on the optimized results was then carried out.

AB The conventional decoupling controls of variable-speed doubly fed wind turbines provide minimal support to the regulation of system frequency. The characteristics of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines and conventional power plans are compared, and the contributions of DFIG to system inertial response and frequency regulation are investigated. The influence of auxiliary loop parameters on the inertial response is illustrated. We also introduce a novel algorithm to enhance the participation of DFIG in existing frequency regulation mechanisms. The proposed approach takes advantage of the fast responses associated with DFIGs. The control system consists of four functional modules, namely, frequency control, rotational speed delay recovery, speed protection, and coordination control with conventional generators. The simulation results show that the control strategy has a fast response speed to the transient frequency error, thereby proving that wind farms can participate in system frequency regulation to a certain extent.

DE wind turbines; mechanism model; internal model control
AB An increasing number of large wind turbines with a variable-speed variable pitch control mechanism are developed to improve the response speed of wind turbines and get maximum active power. Designing a reasonable pitch control system requires both a good control scheme and a more accurate wind turbine model. Base on the analysis of wind turbines' principle, a local linearization model of wind turbine is built by using linearization method of small deviation in this paper. The model's inputs are the data of wind speed and pitch angle, and the output is the active power. The accuracy of the model is verified by studying the active power output of wind turbine under different circumstances in which the pitch angle changes with a constant wind speed and the wind speed changes with a constant pitch angle. At the same time, this paper provides pitch control program based on internal model control after analyzing the disadvantages of PID pitch controller. When the wind speed is beyond the rating, the active power can be limited reasonably around the power rating of wind turbines by adjusting the pitch angle.

AB With increasing installation capacity and wind farms penetration, wind power plays more important role in power systems, and the modeling of wind farms has become an interesting research topic. In this paper, a coherency-based equivalent model has been discussed for the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). Firstly, the dynamic models of wind turbines, DFIG and the mechanisms are briefly introduced. Some existing dynamic equivalent methods such as equivalent wind model, variable speed wind turbine model, parameter identification method and modal equivalent method to be used in wind farm aggregation are discussed. Then, considering wind power fluctuations, a new equivalent model of a wind farm equipped with doubly-fed induction generators is proposed to represent the interactions of the wind farm and grid. The method proposed is based on aggregating the coherent group wind turbines into an equivalent one. Finally, the effectiveness of the equivalent model is demonstrated by comparison with the wind farm response obtained from the detailed model. The dynamic simulations show that the present model can greatly reduce the computation time and model complexity.

AB Based on the analysis of the operating characteristics of wind turbine and the power relations of doubly-fed machine, a power calculation model of stator maximum power at any wind speed, whose input variable is the generator angular speed and output variable is the stator power reference value, is proposed in this paper. Then, by using the close-loop control method, whose reference variable is the stator active power of generator stator and the feedback variable is the stator actual active power, the control system automatically tracks the maximum power point via the power equilibrium without wind speed detecting equipment. In order to regulate the active and reactive power precisely, the field-oriented control technology is applied to decouple the active and reactive power of generator and, thereby, the feed-forward algorithm is also applied to eliminate the cross coupling component of rotor current. The simulation research is carried out using Matlab 7.5 and experiment research is carried using DSP 2407. The result of experiment and simulation testify the feasibility and security of the strategy proposed in this paper.

ID GENERATION SYSTEM; CONTROLLER; DESIGN
AB This paper proposes a control strategy for Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs) aiming in both maximum power harvesting from the wind turbine and minimum power loss of the electrical generator. Thus, maximum efficiency along the whole wind energy conversion process is achieved and additionally expansion of the exploitable wind speed region towards the lower-speed range is accomplished. A squirrel cage induction generator connected to the power grid by means of two back-to-back converters is used. Field oriented control is applied and a system of two Search Controllers (SCs) is introduced for the control of the d- and q-axis stator current components of the generator. The maximum power at the wind turbine is achieved through the one SC by adjusting the q-axis current and through this, the generator speed. Another SC is introduced in order to maximize the efficiency of the electrical generator by controlling its flux-linkage. The dynamic performance of the system is improved by introducing control loops that compensate the delayed response of the flux-linkage to the d-axis current component and provide improved torque control operation. Several experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and operational improvements of the proposed control system.

AB The drive towards high efficiency wind energy conversion systems has resulted in almost all the modern wind turbines to operate in the variable speed mode which inevitably requires back-to-back power electronic converters to decouple generator dynamics from the grid. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis on suitable topologies for the generator-side converter (rectifier) of the back-to-back converter arrangement. Performance of the two most popular rectifier systems, namely, the passive diode bridge rectifier and the active six-switch two-level rectifier are taken as two extremes to evaluate other topologies presented in this paper. The other rectifier systems considered in this study include combinations of a diode bridge rectifier and electronic reactance(s), a combination of a rectifier and a dc-dc converter and a half controlled rectifier. Diode-clamped and capacitor-clamped three-level active rectifier topologies and their possible switch reductions are also discussed in relation to the requirements of modern high power wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). Simulation results are presented to support conclusion derived from this analysis.

ID TRANSMISSION; SYSTEM
AB The growth of the industry for the integration of offshore wind farms (OWF) has generated great interest in high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission, especially those based on voltage source converters (VSC). However, line-commutated converters (LCC) are by far the most recognized and widespread HVDC technology. This article investigates the feasibility of a hybrid configuration that combines an LCC with the VSC for the integration of OWF. A hybrid HVDC, with an offshore VSC and onshore LCC, is implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC. The OWF is composed of variable speed wind turbines driving permanent magnet synchronous generators. This paper mainly focuses on the control strategy for overall system. The proposed control strategy is verified through simulation under various conditions, including wind speed variations and onshore faults.

AB This paper presents the analysis of the two control structures used in wind generation systems with permanent magnet synchronous generators, variable speed and fixed pitch, to determine which structure is most appropriate for implementation. These control structures are speed control and torque control. The analysis considers all the elements of wind power generation system, with greater emphasis on the model of the turbine where mechanical torque is considered as a system variable and not as in other studies where it is considered as internal disturbance in the system. The analysis is developed so that the control structure is independent of AC/DC converter that is used in the system. From the analysis is obtained that the speed control can be stable using classical control techniques because it is a nonminimum phase system and the torque control is unstable because it has poles and zeros in the right half plane, very low frequency and very close to each other, so it is very difficult to control using classical control theory. In the evaluation of the speed control structure, the AC/DC converter is Three-phase rectifier Boost in Discontinuous Conduction Mode with an input filter and a Peak Current Control and to avoid the need of mechanical sensors, a Linear Kalman Filter has been chosen to estimate the generator speed.

AB Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control methodology shows useful properties of good performance and robustness in controller design applied to wind turbine. Typically, in the design procedure LQG method is necessary to select weighting matrices in order to solve the Algebraic Riccati Equations and then get the matrices Kalman Filter gain and optimal state-feedback. In order to optimize a LQG control applied to Double-Fed Induction Generator in wind power system, a Genetic Algorithms (GA) adapted to get the best values of the element of weighting matrices is proposed in this paper. The performance indices ISE and ITSE are a good alternative to obtain the fitness function to design LQG controllers with GA. The simulation results show the high effectiveness of this optimal design method. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The parameters of large wind turbine need to be adjusted timely to avoid excessive wind energy that will cause damage on the wind turbine itself. Based on the simplified mathematical model of wind turbine, we got the relationship curve between its parameters. When the speed of wind was higher than the rated wind speed, we figure out the value of pitch angle during the changes of effective wind speed to keep rated output power. Neural Network used to train the data and pitch control system was built, it used to adjust pitch angle once the wind changes, and maintain the output power at rated value. The complex mathematical relation can be replaced by the trained network model. Detailed simulation results have confirmed the feasibility and performance of the optimal control strategy, which protect the wind turbine from damage and prolong its service life.

AB In view of the high-order, nonlinear, strong coupling, multivariable and time varying character of wind energy conversion system, the fuzzy-logic control strategy is introduced in this paper. First, this thesis analyzes and establishes the mechanism model for each component element of the megawatt class variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines as well as the wind speed model. Second, for the goal of maximum wind power extraction under rated wind and peak power output maintaining above rated speed wind, PID controllers as well as fuzzy-logic controllers are designed respectively by different wind velocity condition. The simulation results demonstrate that no matter for the following up performance or the anti-interference capability, the fuzzy controllers which are devised in the paper have a better control effect than PID controllers. The fuzzy controllers can reduce system's overshoot and regulation time more effectively, offset the negative impacts of nonlinearity, and they have better robustness too.

AB Wind power is a clean and renewable energy, and its exploitation is developing rapidly across the world. The Variable Speed Constant Frequency (VSCF) wind power generation system requires the doubly-fed wind generator (DFIG) to have high response as well as good robustness. DFIG will be affected both by internal disturbance of parametic variations and external disturbance of the load torque oscillation. The dynamics of the current response of the present PI controlled rotor may be in bad condition. In addition, the above disturbances reduce efficiency and stability of the wind turbine. Internal model control (IMC) is a kind of control strategy based on mathematical model to design the controller, it has advantages such as simply to design, robustness, convenient to research. Compared with PI control, IMC has a faster response, and is insensitive to the parameter variation and disturbances, but the IMC highly depends on accurate model of the controlled object. To solve this problem, combine the neural networ and IMC to design the neural network internal model controller. The simulation indicates that the dynamic performance and the anti-interference ability of DFIG are improved.

AB Recently, wind energy penetration in power grids has increased in comparison with other renewable energy sources. With development of wind turbine manufacturing technologies, wind energy prices have become comparable with those of conventional energy sources. The stochastic and variable nature of wind speed causes the output power and terminal voltages of wind farms to become fluctuating. These fluctuations not only decrease the network power quality, but also cause some problems in wind farm output power planning. By using Energy Storage System (ESS) in a wind farm, the output of the wind farm can be controlled for improving the power quality and also having more economic utilization. In this paper, using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, the capacity of ESS, the hourly output power of ESS and the wind farm output planning are determined. Consequently, more economic utilization of the wind farm can be achieved with respect to the output power quality. In this research, the total income from energy sales in a one year period has been obtained for three cases: without ESS, with a single ESS and with four separate smaller ESSs.

AB Distributed energy resources (DER) are becoming increasingly common on the electrical grid. Depending on the operating conditions of the DER, which depend on the application, different topologies need to be selected in order to achieve the maximum efficiency of each DER. Complicating the selection is the fact that operating conditions vary over time. For example, the voltage and current drawn from a PV panel varies over the course of a day. To calculate the overall efficiency, the efficiency of a topology at each operating point and the amount of time spent at that operating point must be considered. This work extends existing analytical methods for loss calculations by taking this into account. The specific DER applications considered are a three-phase ultracapacitor energy storage unit (UC-ESU), battery energy storage unit (B-ESU), and photovoltaic array (PV). This work determines for each application if an inverter-only (single-stage) or an inverter plus boost converter (double-stage) topology is more efficient. The results show that a single-stage topology is better for the B-ESU and PV, while the double-stage topology is better for the UC-ESU. The method is applicable to other DER types, including wind turbines, micro-hydro generators, variable-speed gensets, and microturbines.

AB A robust controller of wind turbine pitch angle is designed by using the quantitative feedback theory based on the analysis of wind power system model in this paper. The controller design methodology is to select the system parameters quantitatively at different wind speed disturbances in order to optimize the response time and the output stability. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the controller can control the speed stability of wind power system with strong robustness to uncertain disturbances of the system parameters when the wind speed fluctuates randomly.

AB The dynamic model of planetary gear system was built up with the consideration of the running characteristics of variable speed and variable load of wind turbine transmission system. The expression of dynamic factor which described by external change load and deformation vibration was studied. Then, the response characteristics and dynamic load of planetary gear system of wind turbine have been studied with the consideration of changing external load and time-varying stiffness, mesh phase and nonlinear stiffness of bearing. The results show that: the frequency response of system reflects the low frequency component of external load. The influence of external incentives on sun gear and planet gear is very significant, and the distinguish between low frequency vibration and high frequency vibration is obvious. The flexibility of system has an obvious impact on dynamic load of bearing. The results lay a foundation for strength design and fatigue analysis of wind turbine gearbox.

AB Gearboxes and generators are fundamental components of all electrical machines and the backbone of all electricity generation. Since the wind energy represents one of the key energy sources of the future, the number of wind turbines installed worldwide is rapidly increasing. Unlike in the past wind turbines are more often positioned in arctic as well as in desert like regions, and thereby exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Especially the temperature in those regions is a key factor that defines the design and choice of components and materials of the drive train. To optimize the design and health monitoring under varying temperatures it is important to understand the thermal behaviour dependent on environmental and machine parameters. This paper investigates the behaviour of the stator temperature of the double fed induction generator of a wind turbine. Therefore, different scenarios such as start of the turbine after a long period of no load, stop of the turbine after a long period of full load and others are isolated and analysed. For each scenario the dependences of the temperature on multiple wind turbine parameters such as power, speed and torque are studied. With the help of the regression analysis for multiple variables, it is pointed out which parameters have high impact on the thermal behaviour. Furthermore, an analysis was done to study the dependences in the time domain. The research conducted is based on 10 months of data of a 2 MW wind turbine using an adapted data acquisition system for high sampled data. The results appear promising, and lead to a better understanding of the thermal behaviour of a wind turbine drive train. Furthermore, the results represent the base of future research of drive trains under harsh environmental conditions, and it can be used to improve the fault diagnosis and design of electrical machines.

AB This paper presents the design of a hybrid electric power generation system utilizing both wind and solar energy for supplying model community living in Ethiopian remote area. The work was begun by investigating wind and solar energy potentials of the desired site, compiling data from different sources and analyzing it using a software tool. The data regarding wind speed and solar irradiation for the site understudy are collected from the National Metrological Agency (NMA) and analyzed using the software tool HOMER. According to the results obtained through the analysis, the site has abundant solar energy potential and the wind energy potential is unquestionably high enough to be exploited for generating electric energy using wind turbines with low cut-in wind speed. The design of a standalone PV-wind hybrid power generating system has proceeded based on the promising findings of these two renewable energy resource potentials, wind and solar. Electric load for the basic needs of the community such lighting, water pumping, a radio receiver, flour mill and medical equipment for a health clinic has been suggested. The simulations and design has been carried out using the HOMER software. By running the software the simulation results which are lists of power supply systems have been generated and arranged in ascending order according to their net present cost. Sensitivity variables, such as range of wind speed, solar radiation, PV panel price and diesel price have been defined as inputs into the software and the optimization process has been carried out repeatedly for the sensitivity variables and the results have been refined accordingly.

The whole system is initially modeled, including the PMSG, the boost converter and the storage system. The required power for the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed wind turbine and energy storage systems, subject to an appropriate control method. Energy storage devices are required for power balance and power quality in stand alone wind energy systems. The main purpose is to supply 230 V / 50 Hz domestic appliances through a single-phase inverter. The experimental waveforms, compared to the simulation results, show a good prediction of the electrical variable parameters. Furthermore, it can be seen that the results validate the stability of the supply.

ID SYSTEMS
AB High performance and reliability are required for wind turbines to be competitive within the energy market. To capture their nonlinear behavior, wind turbines are often modeled using parameter-varying models. In this chapter, a framework for modelling and controller design of wind turbines is presented. We specifically consider variable-speed, variable-pitch wind turbines with faults on actuators and sensors. Linear parameter-varying (LPV) controllers can be designed by a proposed method that allows the inclusion of faults in the LPV controller design. Moreover, the controller structure can be arbitrarily chosen: static output feedback, dynamic (reduced order) output feedback, decentralized, among others. The controllers are scheduled on an estimated wind speed to manage the parameter-varying nature of the model and on information from a fault diagnosis system. The optimization problems involved in the controller synthesis are solved by an iterative LMI-based algorithm. The resulting controllers can also be easily implemented in practice due to low data storage and simple math operations. The performance of the LPV controllers is assessed by nonlinear simulations results.

AB An iterative redesign algorithm is proposed to integrate the design of the structural parameters and a linear parameter-varying (LPV) controller for a three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine. The LPV controller is designed for an eighth-order lumped model of the wind turbine consisting of blades, drive-train and the tower. The lumped model response is matched with detailed open-loop numerical simulations using the Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence (FAST) code. The controller is scheduled in real-time based on the mean wind speed to account for the varying system dynamics. The objective is to track the operating trajectory meanwhile minimise the H-infinity performance index from the wind turbulence to the controlled output vector consisting of pitch angle, blade tip deflection, and the generator speed and torque. Sensitivity analysis of the closed-loop performance index with respect to the structural parameters of the system is examined. The integrated design problem is formulated as an iterative sequential controller/structure redesign to obtain the structural parameters and controller matrices corresponding to a local optimal performance index. Each step of the iterative procedure is formulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimisation problem that can be solved efficiently using available LMI solvers. The evolution of the structural parameters and performance index through the integrated design is illustrated. The FAST closed-loop simulations for two selected designs with the smallest values of the performance index demonstrate the improved performance of the overall system through the integrated structure/control redesign in both minimising the effect of the wind disturbance on the generator output power, and reducing the structural loads on the wind turbine.

AB The primary purpose of this research effort is to propose a novel efficiency boosting design feature in a drag type vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), explore practicality through design and fabrication, and test the viability of the design through wind tunnel experiments. Using adaptive control surface design and an improved blade shape can be very useful in harnessing the wind's energy in low wind speed areas. The new design is based on a series of smaller blade elements to make any shape, which changes to reduce a negative resistance as it rotates and thus maximizing the useful torque. As such, these blades were designed into a modified Savonius wind turbine with the goal of improving upon the power coefficient produced by a more conventional design. The experiment yielded some positive observations with regard to starting characteristics. Torque and angular velocity data was recorded for both the conventional configuration and the newly built configuration and the torque and power coefficient results were compared.

DE DFIG; mathematical model; frequency response; frequency control
AB The active and reactive power decoupling control for the double-fed induction generator wind turbines(DFIG) does not play a positive role to the frequency response ability of power grid because it performs as the hidden inertia for the power grid. If we want to improve the transient frequency stability of the wind turbine when it is integrated with the system, we must ameliorate its frequency response characteristics. The inability of frequency control due to DFIG decoupling control could be overcome through releasing (or absorbing) a part of the kinetic energy stored in the rotor, so as to increase (or decrease) active power injected to the power system when the deviation of power system frequency appears. This paper discusses the mathematical model of the variable speed DFIG, including the aerodynamic model, pitch control system model, shaft model, generator model and inverter control model, and other key components, focusing on the mathematical model of the converters in rotor side and grid side. Based on the existing model of wind generator, the paper attaches the frequency control model on the platform of the simulation software DIgSILENT/PowerFactory. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can response quickly to transient frequency deviation and prove that wind farms can participate in the system frequency regulation to a certain extent. Finally, the result verifies the accuracy and plausibility of the inverter control model which attaches the frequency control module.

AB So far, much attention has been not received by the influence of the control modes on the wind turbine efficiency in maximum wind energy extraction, which is investigated based on variable speed wind turbines with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) under vector control in stator flux orientation (SFO) in the paper. Prior art has tended to have an importance on investigating the principle and behaviors of control strategies in itself. As a result, two control modes, optimal rotor speed control mode and peak power control mode is investigated in detail. At first, Stator flux-orientated vector control for the rotor side converter of DFIG is reviewed, and in turn a comparison on two control modes is presented. Finally, a complete simulation model is developed to investigate how the operation of maximum wind energy extraction of the turbine below rated wind velocity, especially the wind turbine efficiency is affected by the two control methods. Simulation results are presented and compared under the two different control modes. Simulation results show that maximum wind energy extraction of the turbine and its efficiency is affected by different control modes.

AB This study proposes a novel control strategy for the provision of an active power reserve for variable-speed wind turbines. The proposed control strategy aims at maximising the rotational kinetic energy by jointly optimising the rotational speed and the pitch angle using differential evolution. The optimisation process takes into account the given frequency support power-reserve margin. Based on the optimisation results, a novel controller strategy is proposed and compared with other existing approaches. This comparison reveals that relative to existing methods at the same de-loaded power, the proposed method yields more rotational kinetic energy released into the system in the event of frequency deviations, thus increasing the frequency stability of the power system.

DE wind energy conversion; wind power; grid connected wind turbine system
AB The future trend of wind energy conversion systems is to draw the maximum power from the available wind. Unfortunately this is not possible with high capacity wind turbine, as they can be rotated only for a particular speed. The wind turbine system stated here is a 3.2 KW wind turbine which is allowed to rotate at any speed to grab the maximum power from the available wind. The size of the wind turbine system is small, as a result they can be placed on the roof tops and de-regulation of power can be done. This wind turbine system provides a three phase variable frequency AC voltage and this variable frequency AC is converted into constant three phase 230V AC by using the converter and inverter systems.

AB This paper presents a novel sensorless maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategy for capturing the maximum energy from the fluctuating wind speed that being used in the stand-alone small scale variable speed wind turbine generator system (VSWTGS). The generated electricity from the wind turbine systems is used to charge battery energy storage. The whole system including the wind turbine, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), power converter, filter and lead acid battery has been simulated in Matlab/SimPowerSystem simulation software. The MPPT controller is developed to function as a wind speed estimator to generate an appropriate duty cycle for controlling power MOSFET switch in of the boost converter in order to capture maximum power in variable wind speed. From the simulation results, the power converters and filters are showing good performance in charging the lead acid battery. Besides, the novel MPPT controller is capable of extracting the maximum power from the fluctuating wind speed and exhibits good performance in both steady state and transient condition.

So, we can go to non-conventional energy sources like solar, tidal, wind and etc. In that wind generating system is rapidly growing one. The wind speed is not constant at all times they can using variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) or Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG).

AB Wind energy, among all of the renewable energy sources, has made rapid developments and significant inroads in electrical power systems. With the increased use of wind energy conversion systems (WECSs), several technologies have been developed. Since WECSs are more cost competitive, the comparison of different wind generator systems is the need of the hour. Permanent magnet generators employing these technologies have some significant advantages over conventional generators, such as no need of excitation, low volume and weight, high precision, and deletion of the gearbox. A variable-speed WECS with a permanent magnet generator and a matrix converter is proposed in this paper. The traditional power conversion stages consist, of a rectifier followed by an inverter and bulky DC link capacitor. It involves 2 stages of power conversion and, subsequently, the efficiency of the overall WEDS is reduced because of power quality issues mainly based on total harmonic distortion. The matrix converter is mainly utilized to control the output voltage and frequency, and its input current and output voltage are closer to a sine wave. The matrix converter is a simple and compact AC-AC converter. The proposed WECS with matrix converter is modeled using PSIM and results were checked with an experimental setup.

AB In this article, stabilization methods of wind farms composed of fixed-speed wind turbines and variable-speed wind turbines are analyzed. A current-controlled voltage source converter scheme for a variable-speed wind turbine driving doubly fed induction generator is proposed. The proposed scheme is then compared with two other doubly fed induction generator control schemes to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Different types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults are analyzed considering wind farm recent grid codes. Though all of the schemes are able to stabilize the wind farms during transient conditions, the proposed current-controlled voltage source converter scheme offers the advantage of less intricacy of controller design, better performance during grid fault, and omission of DC-link protection scheme, which can reduce the overall cost of the system. Moreover, extensive simulation analyses by using PSCAD/EMTDC (Manitoba HVDC Research Center, Manitoba, Canada) are performed to determine the optimum amount of the fixed-speed wind turbine system that can be stabilized by variable-speed wind turbine system.

This common converter can operate at a VF (variable frequency) or at a CF (constant frequency). The results are compared with the conventional onshore wind farm scheme, where individual power converters are connected to each turbine, guaranteeing maximum power generation for the entire wind farm. A methodology to analyze different wind speed and direction scenarios, and to compute the optimal electrical frequency for each one, is presented and applied to different case studies depending on the wind farm size. In order to obtain more realistic values of wind speeds, the wake effect amongst wind turbines is considered. A wake model considering single, partial and multiple wakes inside a wind farm and taking into account different wind directions, is presented. Both wind farm topologies are analyzed by means of simulations, taking into account both wind speed variability in wind farms and the number of wind turbines. The possible resulting benefits of simplifying the MPCs (multiple power converters) of each turbine, namely saving costs, reducing losses and maintenance and increasing the reliability of the system, are analyzed, focusing on the total power extraction. The SLPC-VF scheme is also compared with a CF scheme SLPC-CF, and it is shown that a significant power increase of more than 33% can be obtained with SLPC-VF. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose - Doubly fed induction generator DFIG applied in over 50 percent of modern variable speed wind power systems and interesting also for adjustable speed diesel generation sets or multi-megawatt water turbines is troublesome in the mean of maintenance of slip-rings and brushes. Especially, it concerns isolated power systems and offshore wind turbines. Application of brushless DFIG in such cases eliminates the mentioned problem. Constructions of the machine and consequently the model and mathematical description is more complicated than classical slip-ring DFIG, therefore it is still developed in several scientific institutions to obtain adequate performance. The following work is dedicated to mathematical description, modelling and implementation of the control method for autonomous operation in the laboratory model of brushless DFIG.
   Design/methodology/approach - Analysis and simulation of the machine model and laboratory tests on a small scale prototype of brushless DFIG.
   Findings - It has been proven that sensorless direct voltage control of DFIG can be applied for both slip-ring and brushless machines, as it does not require machine parameters.
   Research limitations/implications - Brushless DFIG development is far from the performance needed by industrial implementation. Lower efficiency and higher reactive power needed by the machine, in comparison to classical DFIG of the same power range, result from double air gap seen by magnetic flux. However, the constructions of prototype machines are better and better, and their capabilities become closer to DFIG.
   Practical implications - Variable and adjustable speed generation systems such as wind turbines, diesel generation sets, water turbines.
   Originality/value - Standalone power systems with DFIG described in several papers require quite complicated control methods based on the mathematical equations of the machine model. Thus, these methods have to be significantly modified for the brushless version of this machine type, due to the fact of a much more complicated model. The proposed sensorless method of the output voltage control requires only redesign (tuning) of the PI controllers responsible for control of the rotor current, stator voltage amplitude and frequency.

AB This paper presents a new converter topology for interfacing a permanent magnet synchronous generator based variable speed wind turbine with a residential power network. The theory of wind energy conversion is analyzed first. Then an example of wind velocity distribution and normalized energy yield is discussed in order to formulate requirements for choosing a power converter. A new topology of an interfacing converter is analyzed and simulation results of a lossless model are presented. Simulation and experimental results of the proposed converter prove that its utilization in wind power applications is beneficial.

   PERFORMANCE
AB A novel shaft-position sensorless algorithm for decoupled control of torque and reactive power (TRPC) of doubly fed machines, such as the classical wound-rotor induction machine (DFIM) and the emerging brushless reluctance machine (BDFRM), has been discussed and experimentally verified in this paper. The underlying control concept is derived from first principles of magnetization and torque production in the machines. For control purposes, only the grid-connected winding measurements and rough knowledge of its resistance value are required. Such a weak parameter dependence makes the TRPC inherently robust, structurally simple, and fast to execute even on low-cost DSPs. A variety of applications are possible including drive and generator systems with limited variable speed ranges (e. g., large pumps and wind turbines), where cost savings of using partially rated power electronics are significant. Two custom-designed and built BDFRM prototypes have served as case studies to evaluate the controller performance by computer simulations and through laboratory experiments.

AB This paper proposes a novel controller design of variable speed permanent magnet (PM) wind generator. The controller system is developed to enhance the fault ride through capability of wind farms including fixed speed wind turbine with induction generator. The controller system of variable speed wind turbine with permanent magnet synchronous generator (VSWT-PMSG) is designed in such way to control active and reactive powers supplied to grid system in normal and fault operating conditions. The simulation studies have been performed using PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that the proposed controller is very effective in improving the voltage stability of the wind farm during a fault.
