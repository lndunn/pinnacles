AB In this paper dynamic modelling, simulation and synthetic operation of adaptive control, supervisory control and space vector control are considered in a stand-alone hybrid power generation system of wind turbine, microturbine and battery storage. Due to efficient and economical utilisation of the renewable energy resources, optimal sizing of the hybrid system is fulfilled based on economic analysis using genetic algorithms. For extraction of maximum energy front a variable speed wind turbine, a developed Lyapunov model reference adaptive feedback linearisation method accompanied by an indirect space vector control is applied Because of more reliability, more fuel flexibility, less environmental pollution, less noise generation and less power fluctuation in comparison with a diesel generator, a hydrogen based microturbine integrated with battery storage is suggested as a back up for this system.

AB In this paper, the authors investigate the evaluation of FOC, DTC and DPC strategies applied to a Variable Speed Wind System (VSWS) based on a DFIG. A comparative analysis of the three controls is performed, in healthy and faulty grid conditions: balanced and unbalanced small voltage dips and grid frequency disturbances. The study emphasizes the limitations introduced by the approximations usually assumed to simplify the design of these control strategies. The influence of these hypotheses is analysed through of the specific wind turbine quantities like generated active and reactive power, electromagnetic torque and currents. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. Copyright (C) 2009 Praise Worthy Prize - All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a topology for a grid-connected generation system, based on two doubly fed induction machines, is presented. The proposed scheme is implemented using an indirect matrix converter (IMC) consisting of an input stage, a three-to-two matrix converter, and two output stages consisting of a pair of voltage source inverters. The input stage is connected to the grid and provides the required dc voltage for the output stages. Space vector modulation (SVM) is used for the input stage producing the maximum dc voltage, with unity power factor operation at the IMC grid-side input. Each of the output converters is connected to the rotor of a DFIM. The rotor currents of each machine are vector controlled for fast dynamic response and tight torque control. Moreover, the SVM algorithm used for the inverters is designed to provide soft switching operation in the input converter. Simulation and experimental results obtained from a 2.5-kW experimental prototype are presented. Steady-state and transient operation is discussed with the system running at below and above synchronous speed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme for variable speed energy systems.

AB In this paper, the performance of a grid-connected wind energy conversion system (WECS), based on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) fed by a matrix converter ( MC), is presented. The MC replaces the back-to-back converters conventionally used to control a DFIG. The MC is operated with close-to-unity power factor at the grid side. Stability issues related to the operation of the MC in the proposed WECS are discussed. A small signal model is used to investigate the dynamic performance of the two control arrangements discussed in this paper. Experimental results, obtained with a 4-kW prototype, are presented and fully discussed in this paper. The performance of the system for variable speed generation is verified using the emulation of a variable speed wind turbine implemented with a digitally controlled dc machine.

AB Dual mechanical port (DMP) machine, a continuous electrical variable transmission, is a very competitive alternative for vulnerable constant speed-ratio mechanical gearbox. In this paper, an optimal design method of a double-layer permanent magnet (PM) DMP machine for wind power application with random low wind turbine speed input and constant high synchronous speed output is proposed. With the stator efficiency and the cooling effect of the inner rotor as reference, an analytical model is built for the initial design of the machine and the finite element analysis (FEA) is investigated for optimization. Then, FEA results are given and the over-load capability of the machine is evaluated. Finally, a 10 kW DMP prototype machine with the cooling system is designed.

AB A prototype 3 kW horizontal upwind type wind turbine generator of 4 m in diameter has been designed and examined under real wind conditions. The machine was designed based on the concept that even small wind turbines should have a variable pitch control system just as large wind turbines, especially in Japan where typhoons occur at least once a year. A characteristic of the machine is the use of a worm and gear system with a stepping motor installed in the center of the hub, and the rotational main shaft. The machine is constructed with no mechanical breaking system so as to avoid damage from strong winds. In a storm, the wind turbine is slowed down by adjusting the pitch angle and the maximum electrical load. Usually the machine is controlled at several stages depending on the rotational speed of the blades. Two control methods have been applied: the variable pitch angle, and regulation of the generator field current. The characteristics of the generator under each rotational speed and field current are first investigated in the laboratory. This paper describes the performances of the wind turbine in terms of the functions of wind turbine rotational speed, generated outputs, and its stability for wind speed changes. The expected performances of the machine have been confirmed under real wind conditions and compared with numerical simulation results. The wind turbine showed a power coefficient of 0.257 under the average wind speed of 7.3 m/s. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper an efficient design along with modeling and simulation of a transformer-less small-scale centralized DC-bus Grid Connected Hybrid (Wind-PV) power system for supplying electric power to a single phase of a three phase low voltage (LV) strong distribution grid are proposed and presented. The main components of the hybrid system are: a PV generator (PVG); and an array of horizontal-axis, fixed-pitch, small-size, variable-speed wind turbines (WTs) with direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) having an embedded uncontrolled bridge rectifier. An overview of the basic theory of such systems along with their modeling and simulation via Simulink/MATLAB software package are presented. An intelligent control method is applied to the proposed configuration to simultaneously achieve three desired goals: to extract maximum power from each hybrid power system component (PVG and WTs); to guarantee DC voltage regulation/stabilization at the input of the inverter; to transfer the total produced electric power to the electric grid, while fulfilling all necessary interconnection requirements. Finally, a practical case study is conducted for the purpose of fully evaluating a possible installation in a city site of Xanthi/Greece, and the practical results of the simulations are presented.

AB The need to obtain automatic filters to treat wind data is clear due to the huge amount of data available in any wind farm analysis. Automatic detection of performance deviations of wind turbines is required for maintenance purposes. In spite of some alarms being registered by the wind farm's SCADA system, many times automatic use of real data use is not valid due to its low quality. In this paper, the problems to carry out the characterization of the turbines in a wind farm are stated and a new technique to filter the data is presented. The robust statistical technique of the Least Median of Squares (LMedS) combined with a random search is adapted to deal with this problem with promising results. A mathematical model representing the dependency of the wind turbine behaviour in function not only of the wind speed but also of other variables such as the direction of the wind is also proposed. The results achieved are tested with long term real data from wind farms in Spain. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Grid-connected wind turbines are fluctuating power sources that may produce flicker during continuous operation. This paper presents a simulation model of a megawatt-level variable-speed wind turbine with a full-scale back-to-back power converter developed in the simulation tool of PSCAD/EMTDC. Flicker emission of this system is investigated. Reactive power compensation is mostly adopted for flicker mitigation. However, the flicker mitigation technique shows its limits, when the grid impedance angle is low in some distribution networks. A new method of flicker mitigation by controlling active power is proposed. It smoothes the 3p active power oscillations from wind shear and tower shadow effects of the wind turbine by varying the dc-link voltage of the full-scale converter. Simulation results show that damping the 3p active power oscillation by using the flicker mitigation controller is an effective means for flicker mitigation of variable-speed wind turbines with full-scale back-to-back power converters during continuous operation.

AB This paper examines the possibility of providing reactive power support to the grid from wind farms (WFs) as a part of the ancillary service provisions. Detailed analysis of the WF capability curve is carried out considering maximum hourly variation of wind power from the forecasted value. Different cost components are identified, and subsequently, a generalized reactive power cost model is developed for wind turbine generators that can help the independent system operator (ISO) in managing the system and the grid efficiently. Apart from the fixed cost and the cost of loss components, a new method is proposed to calculate the opportunity cost component for a WF considering hourly wind variations. The Cigre 32-bus test system is used to demonstrate a case study showing the implementation of the developed model in short-term system operations. A finding is that higher wind speed prediction errors (a site with high degree of wind fluctuations) may lead to increased payments to the WFs for this service, mainly due to the increased lost opportunity cost (LOC) component. In a demonstrated case, it is found that 2340 $/h is paid to the WF as the LOC payment only, when the wind prediction error is 0.5 per unit (p.u.), whereas 54 $/h is the expected total payment to the WF when the prediction error is 0.2 p.u. for its reactive power service.

AB This paper presents a system using an energy capacitor system (ECS) to smoothen the output power fluctuation of a variable-speed wind farm. The variable-speed wind turbine driving a permanent-magnet synchronous generator is considered to be connected to the ac network through a fully controlled frequency converter. The detailed modeling and control strategy of the frequency converter as well as variable-speed operation of a wind turbine generator system are demonstrated. Afterward, a suitable and economical topology of ECS composed of a current-controlled voltage-source inverter, de-de buck/boost converter, and an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) bank is presented, including their control strategies. Exponential moving average is used to generate the real input power reference of ECS. Another novel feature of this paper is the incorporation of a fuzzy-logic-controlled reference signal adjuster in the control of the dc-dc buck/boost converter, in which the stored energy of the EDLC bank is utilized in an efficient way. Due to this controller, the energy storage capacity of the EDLC bank can be reduced in size, thus resulting in reduction of the overall cost of the ECS unit as well as decrease in irrepressible operations during high and low energy levels of the EDLC bank. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented that validate the effectiveness of the proposed system to smoothen the output power fluctuation of the variable-speed wind farm.

AB The concept of anticipatory control applied to wind turbines is presented. Anticipatory control is based on the model predictive control (MPC) approach. Unlike the MPC method, non-controllable variables (such as wind speed) are directly considered in the dynamic equations presented in the paper to predict response variables, e.g., rotor speed and turbine power output. To determine future states of the power drive with the dynamic equations, a time series model was built for wind speed. The time series model was fused with the dynamic equations to predict the response variables over a certain prediction horizon. Based on these predictions, an optimization model was solved to find the optimal control settings to improve the power output without incurring large rotor speed changes. As both the dynamic equations and time series model were built by data mining algorithms, no gradient information is available. A modified evolutionary strategy algorithm was used to solve a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The proposed approach has been tested on the data collected from a 1.5 MW wind turbine.

AB This paper deals with the power generation control in variable-speed wind turbines. These systems have two operation regions which depend on wind turbine tip speed ratio. A high-order sliding-mode control strategy is then proposed to ensure stability in both operation regions and to impose the ideal feedback control solution in spite of model uncertainties. This control strategy presents attractive features such as robustness to parametric uncertainties of the turbine. The proposed sliding-mode control approach has been validated on a 1.5-MW three-blade wind turbine using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory wind turbine simulator FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) code. Validation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of power regulation. Moreover, the sliding-mode approach is arranged so as to produce no chattering in the generated torque that could lead to increased mechanical stress because of strong torque variations.

AB This paper describes a simple and economical way to improve the behaviour of a stall control wind turbine with fixed speed induction generator during faults. It proposes using the existing thyristor bridge and capacitors in combination with new resistors, to create a self-exciting system isolated from the grid during faults, controlling the terminal voltage and speed generator in order to reduce the reactive consumption and peak speed. This is possible as a result of the thyristor bridge and resistor acting as a variable load.
   Dynamic simulations show that fault ride-through capability for symmetrical and asymmetrical faults of a stall wind turbine can be achieved by using this proposal. A comparison between this solution and the standard static compensator solution demonstrates that the proposed solution works better, mainly because of the absence of overspeed problems when the overspeed protection is set at around 1.04p.u. (a typical level for these wind turbines). Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In wind energy conversion systems, one of the operational problems is the changeability and discontinuity of wind. In most cases, wind speed can fluctuate rapidly. Hence, quality of produced energy becomes an important problem in wind energy conversion plants. Several control techniques have been applied to improve the quality of power generated from wind turbines. Pitch control is the most efficient and popular power control method, especially for variable-speed wind turbines. It is a useful method for power regulation above the rated wind speed. This paper proposes an artificial neural network-based pitch angle controller for wind turbines. In the simulations, a variable-speed wind turbine is modeled, and its operation is observed by using two types of artificial neural network controllers. These are multi-layer perceptrons with back propagation learning algorithm and radial basis function network. It is shown that the power Output Was Successfully regulated during high wind speed, and as a result overloading or outage of the wind turbine was prevented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents the real-time digital simulation of a grid-connected wind turbine generator system (WTGS) based on a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). A 1.5-MW WTGS is the basis for model development. First a detailed electromagnetic transient model for the WTGS is developed in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. This model includes the complete aerodynamic, mechanical and electrical components of the wind turbine, the back-to-back voltage source converter (VSC)-based power electronic interface, as well as the mechanical and electrical controllers of the WTGS. The overall grid-connected WTGS model was then order-reduced and implemented on a PC-cluster-based real-time digital simulator. The maximum execution time of the DFIG model and control was 5.53 mu s while that of the grid-connected WTGS was 15.375 mu s Real-time oscilloscope results are presented to illustrate the WTGS controller performance, the variable wind speed dynamics, and interaction of the WTGS with grid faults. The real-time WTGS model can be readily used for hardware-in-the-loop testing.

AB The targeted and current development of wind energy in various countries around the world reveals that wind power is the fastest growing power generation technology. Among the several wind generation technologies, variable speed wind turbines utilizing doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are gaining momentum in the power industry. With the increase in penetration of these wind turbines, the power system dominated by synchronous machines will experience a change in dynamics and operational characteristics. Given this assertion, the present paper develops an approach to analyze the impact of increased penetration of DFIG-based wind turbines on transient and small signal stability of a large power system. The primary basis of the method is to convert the DFIG machines into equivalent conventional round rotor synchronous machines and then evaluate the sensitivity of the eigenvalues with respect to inertia. In this regard, modes that are both detrimentally and beneficially affected by the change in inertia are identified. These modes are then excited by appropriate disturbances and the impact of reduced inertia on transient stability performance is also examined. The proposed technique is tested on a large test system representing the Midwestern portion of the U. S. interconnection. The results obtained indicate that the proposed method effectively identifies both detrimental and beneficial impacts of increased DFIG penetration both for transient stability and small signal stability related performance.

AB Variable speed operation enables wind turbine systems to increase their aerodynamic efficiency and reduce fatigue loads. An alternative to the current electrically based variable speed technologies is the continuously variable transmission (CVT). A CVT is a transmission whose gear ratio can be adjusted to take on an infinite number of settings within the range between its upper and lower limits. CVT research in wind turbine applications predicts an improvement in output power and torque loads compared with fixed-speed machines. Also, a reduction in the harmonic content of the currents is anticipated by eliminating the power electronics. This paper develops a model that combines a CVT model with the FAST wind turbine simulator for simulating the system's performance in MATLAB/SIMULINK. This model is useful for control development for a variable-speed wind turbine using a CVT. The wind turbine with CVT is simulated using two controllers: a proportional-integral controller and a nonlinear torque controller of the type commonly used in the wind industry.

This paper presents the simulation of a model of the doubly fed induction generator in the simulation software PSCAD/EMTDC. This model has been used to study flicker during continuous operation and the effect of SCR and grid impedance angle on flicker emission. Simulation results show that compensation of the stator reactive power is an effective method to considerably reduce the flicker levels, irrespective of the grid conditions.

AB A dynamic model of a variable speed stand alone wind generation system is developed. The transient performance of the system under variable wind gust and other disturbance conditions has been studied. It has been observed that a stand alone generator is very vulnerable to transient disturbances in the system. A variable susceptance excitation control system, installed at the generator terminal, has been shown to improve the dynamic performance of the system following transient disturbances. Additional pole-placement based PI and PID controllers in the excitation control circuit are shown to control the violently oscillating and even growing transients very effectively. The robustness of the proposed controller has been tested for various disturbances and also for a range of operation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper uses the data from seven wind farms at Muppandal, Tamil Nadu, India, collected for three years from April 2002 to March 2005 for the estimation of energy yield from wind farms. The model is developed with the help of neural network methodology, and it involves three input variables-wind speed, relative humidity, and generation hours-and one output variable, which give the energy output from wind farms. The modeling is done using MATLAB software. The most appropriate neural network configuration after trial and error is found to be 3-5-1 (3 input layer neurons, 5 hidden layer neurons, 1 output layer neuron). The mean square error for the estimated values with respect to the measured data is 7.6 x 10(-3). The results demonstrate that this work is an efficient energy yield estimation tool for wind farms.

AB A serial AC-DC integrated load flow algorithm for variable speed offshore wind farms is proposed. It divides the electrical system of a wind farm into several local networks, and different load flow methods are used for these local networks sequentially. This method is fast, more accurate, and many factors such as the different wind farm configurations, the control of wind turbines and the power losses of pulse width modulation converters are considered. The DC/DC converter model is proposed and integrated into load flow algorithm by modifying the Jacobian matrix. Two iterative methods are proposed and integrated into the load flow algorithm: one takes into account the control strategy of converters and the other considers the power losses of converters. In addition, different types of variable speed wind turbine systems with different control methods are investigated. Finally, the method is demonstrated using an 80-MW offshore wind farm.

ID ENERGY-CONVERSION SYSTEMS; GAIN SCHEDULING CONTROL; MODELS
AB A robust pitch (RP) controller for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbine generator systems (VSVP-WTGS) is presented. The controller can not only level the wind energy conversion but also be applicable in a wide wind speed region even subject to large parametric or non-parametric disturbances. VSVP-WTGS consists of multi-subsystems with different time scales. The dominant 'slow' dynamics are non-affine and high nonlinear. By considering 'fast' subsystems as perturbations to the 'slow' one, the dynamics of VSVP-WTGS can be represented by a nominal model and an error one. The RP controller is composed of a nominal inverse-system controller and a robust compensator. With the nominal inverse-system controller, the nominal closed-loop system can track its reference dynamics. With the robust compensator, turbine parameter uncertainties and non-parametric perturbations are tolerated. The performance of the RP controller is confirmed through theoretical analyses and computer simulations. Results show that RP controller can operate in a wider wind speed region robustly compared with a proportional-integral-derivative controller. Compared with other nonlinear controllers, the RP controller is simpler and can be more easily extended to other kinds of WTGS.

Mathematical model on time domain is obtained for wind turbine and double output induction generator separately. A fuzzy logic controller is designed to obtain maximum total output power from the generator considering the restrictions of the system and the speed of the wind which is not constant. Finally, the simulation results and experimental results carried out in the laboratory are compared. This study shows that using an appropriate control strategy, maximum output power can be obtained from the wind tribune connected to DOIG.

AB Permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) are commonly used for small variable-speed wind turbines to produce high-efficiency, high-reliability, and low-cost wind power generation. This paper proposes a novel control scheme for an interior PMSG (IPMSG) driven by a wind turbine, in which the d-axis and q-axis stator-current components are optimally controlled to achieve the maximum wind power generation and loss minimization of the IPMSG. The effect of magnetic saturation, which causes the highly nonlinear characteristics of the IPMSG, is considered in the control-scheme design. The optimal d-axis stator-current command is obtained as a function of the IPMSG rotor speed by solving a constrained nonlinear-optimization problem that minimizes the copper and core losses of the IPMSG. At any wind speed within the operating range, the IPMSG rotor speed is optimally controlled to extract maximum wind power. The optimal q-axis stator-current command is then obtained from the optimal IPMSG rotor speed and d-axis current. To eliminate the effects of nonlinearity caused by magnetic saturation, an input-output feedback linearization technique is applied to design the high-performance nonlinear current controllers. The proposed control scheme provides the wind generation system with the maximum efficiency, and high dynamic performance.

Three distinct cases are simulated in order to illustrate the influence of DFIG penetration on frequency regulation. Provision of inertial response by DFIG through artificial speed coupling is also presented. The effects of the inertial response on the machine behavior and its significance for frequency regulation are discussed. The influence of converter current limits and auxiliary loop parameters on the inertial response are illustrated and a novel control algorithm is developed for extracting maximum energy from the turbine in a stable manner. The results of the study are illustrated on the example of an isolated power system consisting of a diesel generator and a DFIG.

AB This work presents a design procedure based on evolutionary computation, more specifically on a genetic algorithm combined with the formal pole placement project, to obtain optimal controllers to the rotor-side converter of doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs), in variable-speed wind generation systems connected to the electrical grid. With this procedure it is intended to improve the global system dynamic behaviour during and after the fault period, also increasing the transient stability margin of the power system and the fault ride-through capability. The control action of the DFIG converters is accomplished by proportional and integral controllers, whose gains' adjustment is not a trivial task, because of the high complexity of the system. The results obtained confirm the efficiency of the proposed control design procedure.

ID FED INDUCTION GENERATOR
AB A cascaded nonlinear controller is designed for a variable speed wind turbine equipped with a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The main objective of the controller is wind energy capture optimization while avoiding strong transients in the turbine components and specially in the drive train. The inner loop controller ensures an efficient tracking of both generator torque and stator flux, while the outer loop controller achieves a close tracking of the optimal blade rotor speed to optimize wind energy capture. It is combined to a wind speed estimator that provides an estimation of the wind speed and the aerodynamic torque involved in the controller. The global controller is firstly tested with a simplified mathematical model of the aeroturbine and DFIG for a high-turbulence wind speed profile. Secondly, the aeroturbine controller is validated upon a flexible wind turbine simulator. These new control strategies are compared to other existing controllers based on tests upon an aeroelastic wind turbine simulator. The obtained results show better performance in comparison with the existing controllers. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Further evidence on the similarities between transition and separation phenomena occurring in turbomachinery and wind tunnel flows is provided by measurements on a large scale flat plate under a strong adverse pressure gradient. The flat plate has a long laminar separation bubble and is subjected to a range of disturbances with triggering caused by injection of a transverse jet and subsequently by wakes generated by rods moving transversely upstream of the leading edge. Wakes were originally presented individually. Each individual wake provoked a vigorous turbulent patch, resulting in the instantaneous collapse of the separation bubble. This was followed by a very strong, and stable, calmed region. Following the lead given by the experiments of Gutmark and Blackwelder (1987, "On the Structure of Turbulent Spot in a Heated Laminar Boundary Layer," Exp. Fluids, 5, pp. 207-229.) on triggered turbulent spots, wakes were then presented in pairs at different wake spacing intervals. In this way wake interaction effects could be investigated in more detail. As in the work on triggered turbulent spots the spacing between impinging wakes was systematically varied; it was found that for close wake spacings the calmed region acted to suppress the turbulence in the following turbulent patch. To investigate whether this phenomenon was a recurring one or whether the flow then reverted back to its unperturbed state, the experiments were repeated with three and four rods instead of two. This has the potential for making available a wide range of variables including direction and speed of rod rotation. It was found that the subsequent wakes were also suppressed by the calming effect. It may be anticipated that this repeating situation is present in a turbomachine, resulting in hidden benefits for blade count and efficiency. There may also conceivably be blade loading advantages while retaining favorable heat transfer conditions in high pressure turbines or stall margin in axial compressors. The inherent and prospective benefits of the calming effect therefore need to be understood thoroughly and new opportunities exploited where this is feasible.a.

AB The results of an experimental assessment of a small prototype battery charging wind turbine designed for low- and medium-wind regimes are presented. The turbine is based on a newly designed axial flow permanent magnet synchronous generator and a three-bladed rotor with variable twist and taper blades. Overspeed control is performed by a furling mechanism. The turbine has the unique feature of being capable of operating at either 12, 24 or 48 V system voltage, requiring no load control in any case. In the 48 V configuration, the system is capable of providing 2 kWh day(-1) for an average wind speed as low as 3.5 m s(-1) and an air density of 85% of the standard pressure and temperature value. The experimental assessment has been conducted under field conditions with the turbine mounted on a 20 in guy-wired tubular tower. The experimental power curves are shown to be in good agreement with a detailed aerodynamical and electromechanical model of the turbine for non-furling conditions and for wind speeds above the theoretical cut-in speed. In the case of the rapidly spinning load configurations, a finite power production at wind speeds below the theoretical cut-in speed can be observed, which can be explained in terms of inertia effects. During the measurement campaigns with high loads, we were able to observe bifurcations of the power curve, which can be explained in terms of instabilities arising in situations of transition from attached to separated flow. A full experimental C(p)(lambda)-curve has been constructed by operating the turbine under different load conditions and the findings are in good agreement with a variable Reynolds-number blade-element momentum model. The three proposed system configurations have been found to operate with a high aerodynamic efficiency with typical values of the power coefficient in the 0.40-0.45 range.

AB This paper describes a control approach applied on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to provide both voltage and frequency regulation capabilities, and hence, an improvement in the dynamic behavior of a microgrid system. The microgrid system is assumed to be a portion of a medium voltage distribution feeder and is supplied by two distributed generation (DG) units, i.e., a gas-turbine synchronous generator and a variable-speed wind turbine with DFIG. A control approach algorithm is proposed for the DFIG unit to improve both voltage and primary frequency controls. Two distinct operation modes, i.e., grid-connected and islanding mode, are used in the proposed approach for proper transfer from normal to islanding operation. Case studies are simulated based on both planned and unplanned islanding scenarios to evaluate the performance of the control approach. The study results show that the proposed control approach for DGs in the microgrid increase the microgrid system's dynamic performance, reduce frequency changes, and improve bus voltages regulation during islanding and autonomous operations.

DE Distributed generation (DG); parallel inverters; Z-source inverter
AB This paper presents a modulation and controller design method for paralleled Z-source inverter systems applicable for alternative energy sources like solar cells, fuel cells, or variable-speed wind turbines with front-end diode rectifiers. A modulation scheme is designed based on simple shoot-through principle with interleaved carriers to give enhanced ripple reduction in the system. Subsequently, a control method is proposed to equalize the amount of power injected by the inverters in the grid-connected mode and also to provide reliable supply to sensitive loads on-site in the islanding mode. The modulation and controlling methods are proposed to have modular independence so that redundancy, maintainability, and improved reliability of supply can be achieved. The performance of the proposed paralleled Z-source inverter configuration is validated with simulations carried out using Matlab/Simulink/Powersim. Moreover, a prototype is built in the laboratory to obtain the experimental verifications.

AB In this paper, the control of the reactive power supplied by a matrix converter to a grid is presented. A matrix converter is used to feed an induction generator using a space vector modulation algorithm. An input current observer, implemented using an estimation of the modulation matrix, is used in a non-linear controller that regulates the reactive power supplied to the grid by a variable-speed wind energy conversion system (WECS). The results obtained are experimentally validated using a 2 kW experimental prototype implemented using a cage machine, a matrix converter and a wind turbine emulator.

AB New energy concepts such as distributed power generation systems (DPGSs) are changing the face of electric distribution and transmission. Power electronics researchers try to apply new electronic controller solutions with the capacity of implementing new and more complex control algorithms combined with internal high-speed communication interfaces. Thus, it is possible to monitor, store, and transfer a large number of internal variables that can be sent online to local or remote hosts in order to take new set points of different generation units. With this objective, this paper presents the design, implementation, and test of an industrial multiprocessor controller based on a floating-point digital signal processor (DSP) and a field-programmable gate array, which operate cooperatively. The communication architecture, which has been added to the proposed electronic solution, consists of a universal serial bus (USB), implemented with a minimum use of the DSP core, and a controller area network (CAN) bus that permits distributed control. Although the proposed system can be readily applied to any DPGS, in this paper, it is focused on a 150-kVA back-to-back three-level neutral-point-clamped voltage source converter for wind turbine applications.

ID SPEED CONTROL; PERFORMANCE; OPERATION; MACHINE; RANGE
AB Interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machines have gained increased attention for applications in electric vehicle, variable speed wind turbine, industrial drives, etc., because of their high torque density, wider speed range and compact construction. The authors present a detailed analysis and modelling of control trajectories and incorporate those trajectories in the direct torque control (DTC) scheme of an IPM synchronous motor drive, for constant-torque and constant-power operating regions. The control trajectories are implemented on a real-time digital signal processor. Because the inputs to the inner torque control loop of DTC are the references for the torque and the amplitude of the stator flux linkage (lambda(s)), they are transformed in the T-lambda(s) plane, than in the i(d)-i(q) plane in the indirect control. The modelling and experimental results are presented. Results show very good dynamic and steady-state performances of direct torque controller, incorporating these control trajectories.

ID MACHINES; POWER
AB Some large grid connected wind turbines use a low-speed synchronous generator, directly coupled to the turbine, and a fully rated converter to transform power from the turbine to mains electricity. The condition monitoring and diagnosis of mechanical and electrical faults in such a machine are considered, bearing in mind that it has a slow variable speed and is subject to the stochastic, aerodynamic effects of the wind. The application of wavelet transforms is investigated in the light of the disadvantages of spectral analysis in processing signals subject to such stochastic effects. The technique can be used to monitor generator electrical and drive train mechanical faults. It is validated experimentally on a wind turbine condition monitoring test rig using a three-phase, permanent-magnet, slow-speed, synchronous generator, driven by a motor controlled by a model representing the aerodynamic forces from a wind turbine. The possibility of detecting mechanical and electrical faults in wind turbines by electrical signal and particularly power analysis is heralded.

AB A control method for variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs) supplying islanded parts of electrical networks is presented. Active power/frequency and reactive power/voltage droops are applied in order to determine the active, reactive power production, thus downscaling to the VSWTs the conventional control concepts of the power plants. Two types of VSWTs comprising doubly fed induction generators or synchronous generators are considered. Electrical, aerodynamic and structural detailed dynamic models were developed and combined with the proposed control strategies ensuring fast regulation of the frequency and the voltage in the islanded mode of operation. The obtained models are used for the simulation of a representative simplified distribution network supplied by VSWTs.

The dynamic behaviour of a wind generator, including the models of the wind turbine, the doubly fed induction generator, the back-to-back AC/AC converter, the converter control and the power control of this system, is studied. Is also investigated a control method of the FESS system which consists of the classical squirrel-cage induction machine (IM) supplied off the variable speed wind generator (VSWG).

A power reserve is obtained with the help of the generator torque control by following a power reference value lower than the maximum power which must be extracted from the wind. This approach allows also using a part of the kinetic energy in the blades inertia to contribute to this reserve. The dynamic tests carried out on the test bench, by using medium and high variable wind speeds, confirm the capacity of the wind turbine generator (WTG) to participate in the primary frequency control.

AB Nowadays, incentives and financing options for developing renewable energy facilities and the new development in variable speed wind technology make wind energy a competitive source if compared with conventional generation ones. In order to improve the effectiveness of variable speed wind systems, adaptive control systems able to cope with time variances of the system under control are necessary. On these basis, a data driven designing methodology for TSK fuzzy models design is presented in this paper. The methodology, on the basis of given input-output numerical data, generates the 'best' TSK fuzzy model able to estimate with high accuracy the maximum extractable power from a variable speed wind turbine. The design methodology is based on fuzzy clustering methods for partitioning the input-output space combined with genetic algorithms (CA), and recursive least-squares (LS) optimization methods for model parameter adaptation.

The reactive power capability of the proposed system is also investigated. The work presented in this paper demonstrates that, for the proposed WECS, the maximum reactive power supplied to the grid is about 40% of the nominal value.

AB This paper presents a new method to enhance the participation of variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (WECS) in existing frequency regulation mechanisms. The proposed approach, based on a modified inertial control scheme, takes advantage of the fast response capability associated with electronically-controlled WECS, allowing the kinetic energy stored by rotational masses to be partly and transiently released in order to provide earlier frequency support. An additional improvement is achieved by communicating the WECS response to conventional generators so that these can eventually take care of the full load imbalance. Several simulations using a two-area test system are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme.

AB The trend with offshore wind turbines is to increase the rotor diameter as much as possible to decrease the costs per kWh. The increasing dimensions have led to the relative increase in the loads on the wind turbine structure. Because of the increasing rotor size and the spatial load variations along the blade, it is necessary to react to turbulence in a more detailed way: each blade separately and at several separate radial distances. This combined with the strong nonlinear behavior of wind turbines motivates the need for accurate linear parameter-varying (LPV) models for which advanced control synthesis techniques exist within the robust control framework. In this paper we present a closed-loop LPV identification algorithm that uses dedicated scheduling sequences to identify the rotational dynamics of a wind turbine. We assume that the system undergoes the same time variation several times, which makes it possible to use time-invariant identification methods as the input and the output data are chosen from the same point in the variation of the system. We use time-invariant techniques to identify a number of extended observability matrices and state sequences that are inherent to subspace identification identified in a different state basis. We show that by formulating an intersection problem all states can be reconstructed in a general state basis from which the system matrices can be estimated. The novel algorithm is applied on a wind turbine model operating in closed loop. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper introduces a methodology to design a family of robust controllers able to go beyond the classical linear limitations. Combining robust designs and stable switching, the new controllers optimize the time response of the system by fast adaptation of the controller parameters during the transient response according to certain rules based on the amplitude of the error. The methodology is based on both a new graphical stability criterion for switching linear systems and the robust quantitative feedback theory QFT). It is applied to the design of a pitch control system, which is one of the most critical issues in wind turbines, where a tight combination of high reliability (robustness), minimum mechanical fatigue and performance optimization is required.

AB The accurate modeling of wind turbines is an extremely challenging problem due to the tremendous complexity of the machines and the turbulent and unpredictable conditions in which they operate. Adaptive control techniques are well Suited to nonlinear applications, Such as wind turbines, which are difficult to accurately model and which have effects from poorly known operating environments. In this paper, we extended the direct model reference adaptive control (DMRAC) approach to track a reference point and to reject persistent disturbances. This approach was then used to design an adaptive collective pitch controller for a high-fidelity simulation of a variable-speed horizontal axis wind turbine. The objective of the adaptive pitch controller was to regulate generator speed in Region 3 and to reject step disturbances. The control objective was accomplished by collectively pitching the turbine blades.
   The turbine simulation models the controls advanced research turbine (CART) of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. The CART is a utility-scale wind turbine that has a well-developed and extensively verified simulator. This novel application of adaptive control was compared in simulations with a classical proportional integrator (PI) collective pitch controller. In the simulations, the adaptive pitch controller showed improved speed regulation in Region 3 when compared with the PI pitch controller. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper proposes numerical grey relational analysis (NGRA) based sensorless controllers for a small wind generation system. The maximum power of wind-turbine generator varies with the wind speed. Optimal wind energy extraction is operated in variable-speed variable-frequency model. The sensorless control strategies consist of two NGRAs for maximum power extraction. The first NGRA is used the generator output voltage to estimate the maximum power under various wind speed. Then according to maximum power, the convert duty cycle is adjusted by using the second NGRA. For a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.
