AB The objectives of this work have been to design and analyze a discrete Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller which contributes to the primary frequency control of the grid and to the reduction of the drive-train fatigue loads of a Wind Turbine (WT). The WT rotational speed and electrical power are controlled using the generator torque and the pitch angle as control variables. The rotational speed and electrical power references are generated in a higher control level depending on the wind speed and a frequency droop.
   The controller has been designed in Matlab (R) and has been simulated in Simulink (R), in some linear simulation models corresponding to different operating points. These linear models have been obtained from a 5 MW WT model implemented in the commercial wind turbine simulation tool Bladed. The results validate the efficiency of the designed controller, in comparison with another discrete LQG controller which has not been designed to reduce drive-train fatigue loads.

AB In this paper we develop a framework for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling and simulation with emphasis on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and non-matching fluid-structure interface discretizations. We take the augmented Lagrangian approach to FSI as a point of departure. Here the Lagrange multiplier field is defined on the fluid-structure interface and is responsible for coupling of the two subsystems. Thus the FSI formulation does not rely on the continuity of the underlying function spaces across the fluid-structure interface in order to produce the correct coupling conditions between the fluid and structural subdomains. However, in deriving the final FSI formulation the interface Lagrange multiplier is formally eliminated and the formulation is written purely in terms of primal variables. Avoiding the use of Lagrange multipliers adds efficiency to the proposed formulation. As an added benefit, the ability to employ non-matching grids for multi-physics simulations leads to significantly relaxed requirements that are placed on the geometry modeling and meshing tools for IGA.
   We show an application of the proposed FSI formulation to the simulation of the NREL 5 MW offshore wind turbine rotor, where the aerodynamics domain is modeled using volumetric quadratic NURBS, while the rotor structure is modeled using a cubic T-spline-based discretization of a rotation-free Kirchhoff-Love shell. We conclude the article by showing FSI coupling of a T-spline shell with a low-order finite element method (FEM) discretization of the aerodynamics equations. This combined use of IGA and FEM is felt to be a good balance between speed, robustness, and accuracy of FSI simulations for this class of problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper deals with the modeling and power control of horizontal variable speed wind turbines using a new recursive controller. The problem considered is to realize a multi-objective control scheme covering the entire wind turbine working domain. The proposed recursive model free controller (RMFC) is designed to realize a compromise between the maximum-power-point trajectory tracking under realistic wind energy exploitation, the desired rotor speed reference trajectory tracking and the need of decreasing the solicitations induced in the mechanical structure of the turbine. The RMFC uses only the turbine output measurement and does not require knowledge of turbine parameters. It has a very simple structure and can be easily implemented in computer control systems. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control approach are proven by numerical simulations.

AB The trends in wind speed at a typical wind turbine hub height (80 m) are analyzed using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset for 1979-2009. A method, assuming the wind profile in the lower boundary layer as power-law functions of altitude, is developed to invert the power exponent (in the power-law equation) from the NARR data and to compute the following variables at 80 m that are needed for the estimation and interpretation of the trend in wind speed: air density, zonal wind u, meridional wind v, and wind speed. Statistically significant and positive annual trends are found to be predominant over the contiguous United States, with spring and winter being the two largest contributing seasons. Positive trends in surface wind speed are generally smaller than those at 80 m, with less spatial coverage, reflecting stronger increases in wind speed at altitudes above the 80-m level. Large and positive trends in winds over the southeastern region and high-mountain region are primarily due to the increasing trend in southerly wind, while the trends over the northern states (near the Canadian border) are primarily due to the increasing trend in westerly wind. Trends in the 90th percentile of the annual wind speed, a better indicator for the trend in wind power recourses, are 40%-50% larger than but geographically similar to the trends in the annual mean wind speed. The probable climatic drivers for change in wind speed and direction are discussed, and further studies are needed to evaluate the fidelity of wind speed and direction in the NARR.

ID DESIGN
AB The application of variable speed wind generators in hybrid remote area power supply (RAPS) systems provides opportunities for improved voltage and frequency control together with maximum power point tracking (MPPT), where limited research outcomes exist. The study presented in this paper covers two such hybrid systems: 1) permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and 2) doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) as wind turbine technologies together with a battery storage and a dump load. The battery storage system and dump load are able to assist in maintaining the active power balance during over and under generation conditions as well as sudden load changes. Through simulation studies, it has been demonstrated that both RAPS systems are able to regulate the load side voltage and frequency within the acceptable limits while extracting the maximum power from wind, which is an inherent capability of variable speed generators. The two RAPS systems and their associated control strategies have been developed and their performance is investigated using SimPowerSystems blocksets in MATLAB.

AB In this paper, an improved efficiency control scheme for wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) with squirrel cage induction generators is proposed. Thus, the power harvesting from the WECS is increased and additionally expansion of the exploitable wind speed region toward the lower speed range is accomplished. The generator is connected to the power grid by means of two space-vector-controlled back-to-back converters. A minimum ohmic loss (MOL) controller is introduced in order to minimize the generator resistive loss that is accomplished by adjusting the d-axis stator current according to torque conditions. The implementation of the proposed controller is easy and cost effective because neither additional control signals nor the knowledge of the generator loss model is required. The effectiveness of MOL controller and its successful cooperation with two types of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers, which are employed to maximize the wind turbine output power, are experimentally verified. The MPPT controller is implemented by using an adaptive search control and a fuzzy-logic-based control technique, since both are independent of wind turbine characteristics and widely used. Selective experimental results are presented to demonstrate the resulting improvements of the suggested control scheme.

AB The conventional decoupling controls of variable-speed doubly fed wind turbines provide minimal support to the regulation of system frequency. The characteristics of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines and conventional power plans are compared, and the contributions of DFIG to system inertial response and frequency regulation are investigated. The influence of auxiliary loop parameters on the inertial response is illustrated. We also introduce a novel algorithm to enhance the participation of DFIG in existing frequency regulation mechanisms. The proposed approach takes advantage of the fast responses associated with DFIGs. The control system consists of four functional modules, namely, frequency control, rotational speed delay recovery, speed protection, and coordination control with conventional generators. The simulation results show that the control strategy has a fast response speed to the transient frequency error, thereby proving that wind farms can participate in system frequency regulation to a certain extent.

AB This paper focuses on dynamic modeling, simulation, control and energy management in an isolated integrated power generation system consisting of a 315 kW offshore wind turbine, a 175 kW tidal turbine, a 290 kW microturbine, and a 3.27 kAh lead acid battery storage. A first, due to efficient and economical utilization of the renewable energy resources, optimal sizing of the hybrid system is accomplished based on economic analysis using genetic algorithms. A model of power-consumption for a microturbine is obtained using least square estimation algorithm based on capstone (TM) company data and is suggested for implementing at economic analysis. For extraction of maximum energy from a variable speed wind turbine, a developed Lyapunov model reference adaptive feedback linearization method accompanied by an indirect space vector control is applied. Because of more reliability, more fuel flexibility, less environmental pollution, less noise generation and less power fluctuation in comparison with a diesel generator, a microturbine integrated with battery storage is suggested as a back up for this system.
   A supervisory controller is designed for energy management between the maximum energy captured from the wind turbine and consumed energies of the load, dump load, energy of the battery based on state of charge and generated energy by the microturbine. Dynamic modeling and simulation are fulfilled using MATLAB Simulink (TM) 7.2. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Compared with conventional electrical machines, permanent-magnet (PM) machines experience higher efficiency, higher power-to-weight ratio and simpler construction. In this paper, a new three-slot three-phase four-pole rare-earth radial-flux PM variable-speed electrical generator is proposed, designed using Finite Element Technique (FET) and is investigated. In this topology, the soft magnetic material of the rotor is placed at the pole faces of the rectangular high-energy magnets. An air-gap flux density distribution very close to sinusoidal is achieved by curving the faces of the rotor soft magnetic pieces. The steady-state characteristics at different rotational speeds and loading conditions are addressed and compared. Basically, slotted PM electrical machines suffer from cogging torque. The cogging torque of this generator is predicted and compared to the rated value of the machine. The windings, located at flat slots, have short ends which therefore adds further improvements on the efficiency, power-to-weight ratio, operational performance and cost of active material. The obtained output operational performance characteristics of this generator along with the acceptable peak value of the cogging torque demonstrate the success of the topology and the effectiveness of the design methodology.

AB The grid connected Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs) have two practical topologies, the traditional fixed speed and the new variable speed. Variable speed systems have several advantages over the traditional ones, such as reduction of mechanical stress and increase in captured energy: however, the systems need a Power Electronic (PE) converter, in which the machine is connected to the grid via the PE converter. To improve the power quality and decrease electrical losses in the variable speed WECS, choosing a full control PE converter or a simple PE converter including an active filter is essential. In this paper, a new modulation technique is proposed to be used in a Shunt Active Filter (SAF) to improve the output current harmonics of a WECS, including a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and the AC-to-DC converter. The filter contains three parts: the identification, modulation, and an inverter. Most identification methods are sensitive to non-sinusoidal sources, but in the proposed filter an algorithm is used to make it non-sensitive to some extent. The simulation results confirm the superior performance of the proposed SAF over the previous SAFs applied in wind energy conversion systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The wake effect is the key factor affecting the low efficiency of wind power production. It is very important to predict the relationship between the cost and the produced power for various wind-turbine placements under various wind speeds and directions. This paper proposes a GRASP-VNS algorithm for the optimal placement of wind turbines. Four different wind-farm conditions were considered: (a) uniform wind with single direction, (b) uniform wind with variable directions, (c) non-uniform wind with variable directions, and (d) non-uniform and variable-direction wind with land constraint. The proposed GRASP-VNS algorithm combines two well-known metaheuristics, GRASP and VNS, to create additional advantages in yielding the search trajectory. Intensive experiments assuming the four wind-farm conditions were performed. Statistical analyses show that the proposed GRASP-VNS algorithm significantly outperforms three existing GA-based methods.

AB In order for a wind generator (WG) to participate in load-frequency control (LFC) - either primary or secondary - some de-loading of its turbine is required. This paper discusses and rectifies important drawbacks of methods previously suggested on the two main de-loading techniques, i.e. over-speeding and pitch-controlled de-loading. In the same scope, the inertial support offered by WGs is also discussed. Two enhanced control strategies emerge from the above analysis: the first is based on over-speeding de-loading, which, for wind speed close to or above nominal, avoids overloading the converter of WGs equipped with Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG); the second is a method of pitch-controlled de-loading combined with inertial support for fast LFC action. Simulations presented show both the positive performance of the two proposed strategies and their favorable results versus previous cited methodologies. In MATLAB (R) Simulink, a two-bus power system consisting of a varying load, a. diesel-synchronous generator and WG topologies with either a DFIG or a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) are considered.

ID SYSTEMS; RECTIFIER
AB An electrical structure of a variable-speed wind turbine based on an externally excited synchronous generator; a passive diode rectifier; and a boost converter is discussed in this study. The clear advantage of such a system is its lower-semi-conductor devices count. A brief theoretical explanation of such a system is included. A boost converter normally utilies an inductor (energy storage) to boost the voltage level from its input to a higher output value. This study analyses the possibility of using the generator inductance as a boost inductor. It is discussed and verified in the study that for the given switching frequency of the boost converter (f(s) = 1 kHz), the generator sub-transient inductance (not the synchronous inductance) appears as an equivalent inductance seen by the boost converter. The parasitic capacitors present in the generator terminals are often neglected from design issues. It is presented in the study that such capacitors can be a major issue when high-frequency switching is applied to the voltage at the generator terminals. Some major results from the experimental work are included. The experimental setup used in this work is a scaled down 7.5 kVA system.

AB With the advent of power electronics, the size, weight, and cost of power converters have been drastically reduced while efficiency is improved. The use of variable-speed wind power generators has seen considerable growth. The use of gearboxes in the wind turbines allows for smaller size, lower weight, and higher speed generators. However, gearboxes have shown to be one of the least reliable components of the wind turbines. In this paper, we propose a method that can extend the life and reliability of wind turbine gearboxes by reducing the mechanical stress on gearbox components. Reduction of mechanical stress is achieved by the generator torque control that minimizes resonant torsional vibrations within a drivetrain caused by variations in wind velocity. A detailed model for the drivetrain of a 750-kW wind turbine, including a gearbox is presented. Experimental results are used to calculate the parameters of the gearbox. A controller is designed to adjust the generator torque at the end of the drivetrain to remove the unwanted and damaging torque variations from the drivetrain. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Modern wind turbines are designed in order to work in variable speed operations. To perform this task, these turbines are provided with adjustable speed generators, like the double feed induction generator (DFIG). One of the main advantages of adjustable speed generators is improving the system efficiency compared with fixed speed generators, because turbine speed can be adjusted as a function of wind speed in order to maximize the output power. However, this system requires a suitable speed controller in order to track the optimal reference speed of the wind turbine. In this work, a sliding mode control for variable speed wind turbines is proposed. The proposed design also uses the vector oriented control theory in order to simplify the D FIG dynamical equations. The stability analysis of the proposed controller has been carried out under wind variations and parameter uncertainties using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulated results show on the one hand that the proposed controller provides a high-performance dynamic behavior, and on the other hand that this scheme is robust with respect to parameter uncertainties and wind speed variations, which usually appear in real systems.

AB This paper reports on the development of a permanent-magnet (PM) generator for a wind turbine which has variable winding connections for load matching. This means that the generator characteristics can be regulated via winding changeover so that the wind turbine can be controlled and maximum power point tacking (MPPT) followed; constant power output is possible without pitch control, complex algorithms or expensive power converters. The operating range (up to the cut-out point) can be extended into the high wind speed zone without drawing high power from the wind. This is achieved by maintaining the generator at the rated power when the wind speed increases beyond the rated point. Therefore, the specifications and costs of the generator and power electronics can be reduced. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.

AB This paper proposes the integration of steady-state models of several types of wind generators into a power flow algorithm with automatic load-frequency control. Since the system frequency deviation is considered a state variable to be computed by the power flow solution, this formulation helps identify the operating point of wind generators after the action of the primary frequency control when power imbalances have occurred. The mathematical formulation of fixed-speed wind generators is presented based on the steady-state representation of the induction generator. Furthermore, as variable-speed wind generators keep gaining prominence in power systems, their potential contribution to frequency support is also analyzed herein. These models are formulated within the power flow approach by using a unified single frame of reference and the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The proposed approach is then applied to the analysis of a three-machine, eight-bus system and the IEEE-14 bus test system.

AB Miscellaneous sorts of renewable energies, despite of their positive impacts on the power system operation cost and environmental concerns, could jeopardize the system reliability due to introducing significant degrees of intermittency and uncertainty. This challenge could be overcome by composing various sources of renewable energies with complimentary natures. This paper devises an explicit mathematical framework to compromise the contribution of wind and solar energies. The optimization problem is to maximize the system reliability subject to a fixed monetary investment associated with both wind and solar. The problem formulation is based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) format in which the optimality of the solution is guaranteed or can be traded with the execution time. The decision variables are the number of wind turbines and solar modules to be deployed. In addition, uncertainties associated with the hourly load, wind speed, and solar radiation are captured by scenarios based on the probability density functions (PDF). These scenarios are generated by the Monte Carlo simulation method. They are then decreased to a tractable set using a scenario reduction technique. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through numerical evaluations using real field data.

AB A small wind power system (SWPS), which comprises a buck-type DC/DC converter and a microcomputer control unit, is presented for improving its reliability and energy conversion efficiency. The relationship between energy flows for the suggested SWPS is analyzed, and the transition diagram of energy flows under various working modes is established. An integrated power control method is put forward that contains maximum power point tracking, load power tracking control, over speed protection, and optimization of battery management. A power controller which is based on the integrated power control strategy is designed, and its performance is tested on the experimental platform for SWPS. Experimental results indicate that the controller can switch on automatically working modes to maintain the energy balance of the proposed SWPS under the conditions of variable wind speeds or loads. Moreover, the wind turbine can utilize wind energy efficiently at the premise of secure operation, and the battery life can be prolonged on condition of reasonable energy management. Therefore, the suggested integrated power control method in this paper can make the SWPS to obtain optimal and reliable operation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of bi-directional horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) rotors was prototyped. The geometry and motion parameters of the turbine series cover a wide range of tidal turbine operating conditions targeted to the tidal flow speed probability distribution of the Bay of Fundy, NS Canada. A generic yet novel wind/tidal turbine rotor design and optimization procedure was developed and used for the optimization process. In the process, optimum annual energy production, as a benchmark, was obtained and used for comparison by taking into account both rotor hydrodynamic power production performance characteristics and annual tidal inflow speed probability distribution. The diameter of the full-scale bi-directional HATT rotor series developed is 20-m. Optimum values of various variables were obtained for maximum annual energy production. These optimum values include: uniform pitch-diameter-ratio (p/D) distributions. nominal pitch values with different curve forms of non-uniform p/D distributions, shaft rotational speeds under fixed rotor diameter, diameter at fixed tip-speed-ratio (TSR), a combination of optimum shaft speeds at corresponding inflow speeds and optimum uniform p/D distribution at a fixed rotor diameter, number of rotor blades at fixed chord length, rotor solidity at fixed number of blades, and the combination of number of blades and solidity for both optimum constant pitch distribution and optimum linear pitch distribution. For the 20-m bi-directional HATT, a substantial improvement in power coefficient C-pow was obtained, from 0.28, as a result of the primary optimization process (for both optimum uniform p/D distribution and shaft speed n), to the final maximum of 0.43. This corresponds to a 56% increase in annual energy production of 1230 MW h, from 2188 to 3418 MW h, an improved energy production equivalent to the energy generated from 600 tonnes of coal (at 2 kWh per 1 kg coal from a standard thermal power plant). The annual energy production from the optimized 20-m bi-directional HATT before the deduction of mechanical and electrical conversion loses, is 3418 MW h, equivalent to the electric energy generated from 1550 tonnes of coal.

AB A sensorless vector-control strategy for an induction generator (IG) operating in a grid-connected variable speed wind energy conversion system is presented. The sensorless control is based on a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) observer for estimating the rotational speed. An on-line training recurrent neural network (RNN) controller using back-propagation learning algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed to allow the rotational speed adjustment for power regulation. The node connecting weights of the RNN are trained online by back-propagation (BP) methodology. The PSO is adopted to adjust the learning rates in the BP process to improve the learning capability. The proposed output maximization control is achieved without mechanical sensors such as wind speed or position sensor, and the new control system will deliver maximum electric power with light weight, high efficiency, and high reliability. The concept has been developed and analyzed using a turbine directly driven IG. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Adaptive estimation; hydraulic systems; leak detection; wind energy
ID CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; VALVE
AB Operation and maintenance (OM) cost has contributed a major share in the cost of energy for wind power generation. Condition monitoring can help reduce the OM cost of wind turbine. Among the wind turbine components, the fault diagnosis of the hydraulic pitching system is investigated in this study. The hydraulic pitching system is critical for energy capture, load reduction, and aerodynamic braking. The fault detection of internal and external leakages in the hydraulic pitching system is studied in this paper. Based on the dynamic model of the hydraulic pitching system, an adaptive parameter estimation algorithm has been developed in order to identify the internal and external leakages under the time-varying load on the pitch axis. This scheme can detect and isolate individual faults in spite of their strong coupling in the hydraulic model. A scale-down setup has been developed as the hydraulic pitch emulator, with which the proposed method is verified through experiments. The pitching-axis load input is obtained from simulation of a 1.5-MW variable-speed-variable-pitch turbine model under turbulent wind profiles on the FAST (fatigue, aerodynamics, structural, and tower) software developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. With the experimental data, the leakage and leakage coefficients can be predicted via the proposed method with good performance.

AB The Renewable Distributed Generation (RDG), such as production of electricity in the vicinity of the load, it is particularly beneficial when the distribution network is "weak" facing specific demands, as in hydrogen production systems connected to rural electrification networks. In these areas, the wind resource may be suitable for this type of generation. This work proposes the topology and the operation and control strategy for a hydrogen production station, "assisted" by a weak AC grid and "powered" by a variable speed wind turbine based on a three-phase double stator induction machine. The wind energy conversion is optimized through adequate control of the generator. The electrolyzer current is regulated for the maximum utilization of the generated power. The high-speed power fluctuations by turbulence are compensated through a controlled energy storage system based on a flywheel. In addition, the system configuration, its operation mode and control, and simulation results are presented. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Frequency Response of Power Systems With Variable Speed Wind Turbines

DT Article
DE Emulated inertial response; frequency control; wind power generation
ID INERTIAL RESPONSE; IMPACT
AB As wind penetration levels on power systems increase worldwide and synchronous generation is displaced, the dynamic characteristics of these systems, and hence the protocols for how they are operated, are changing. One issue, of particular concern, is the resulting reduction in system inertia since modern variable speed wind turbines do not inherently contribute to the inertial response of the system. Such devices can, however, be fitted with a control loop which provides an active power response to significant frequency deviations, similar to the inertial response of fixed speed wind turbines and synchronous generation. Unlike conventional machines, however, the response of variable speed turbines is dependent on local wind speeds and so cannot be quantified deterministically by system operators. As a result, it is likely that uncertaintywill exist over the inertial response capability of the system at high wind penetration levels. In this paper, the frequency response capability is assessed on a test system and the effectiveness of wind turbines' contribution to system inertial response is evaluated in the context of future system requirements.

AB This paper proposes a novel strategy for participation of variable speed wind turbines in primary frequency control. The proposed strategy is based on the deployment of the kinetic energy of the rotating masses to reduce the need for deloaded operation while still being able to provide the required power reserve for the defined time frame. A steady-state deloaded operating point is optimized with respect to the amount of kinetic energy stored in the rotating masses. The parameters of the algorithm are calculated offline and stored in lookup tables. The proposed strategy is tested using a modified Nordic 32-bus test system for various operating scenarios. The results show that part of the primary frequency control power reserve of the thermal units can be replaced by the reserve provided by wind power, while retaining the desired frequency response following a disturbance. A comparison with the conventional deloaded strategy shows that between 1.16% and 2.79% energy savings can be achieved on a yearly basis, depending on the wind regime of the sites analyzed.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive modelling and control study of a variable speed wind energy conversion system based on a squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG). The mathematical model of the SCIG is derived in Park frame along with the indirect field oriented control (IFOC) scheme based on a proportional and integral speed controller. A simple maximum power point tracking strategy is used to determine the optimal speed under variable wind speed conditions which is then used as the reference in the IFOC scheme. Power flow between the supply and the inverter is regulated via simultaneous control of the active and reactive currents of the grid and the DC link voltage. The simulation results show that the proposed control technique is able to maximise the energy extracted from the wind during the simulation scenarios considered. The results also demonstrate good transient response characteristics in the decoupled real and reactive powers. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4763562]

AB The world's population needs new sources of energy, especially those that are clean and renewable. This paper provides a brief introduction to wind energy and the types of existing turbines, which are classified using the orientation of the rotation axis. Subsequently, an integral analysis is performed for vertical axis turbines. The known variables are the wind speed, the type of blade, the radius of the rotor and the angular velocity. The fluid velocity and the angle of attack on the blade are subsequently determined. From these two results, the lift and drag forces acting on the blades for each position of the rotor are calculated. The resultant torque and power generated are also calculated to evaluate the turbine power coefficient. Due to the rotation and the robustness of this type of turbine, a distortion in the flow direction occurs in its vicinity. The flow is modeled on a control volume, which is defined based on the variation in the wind direction. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distributed Generators (DGs) in a microgrid may operate in three different reactive power control strategies, including PV, PQ and voltage droop schemes. This paper proposes a new stochastic programming approach for reactive power scheduling of a microgrid, considering the uncertainty of wind farms. The proposed algorithm firstly finds the expected optimal operating point of each DG in V-Q plane while the wind speed is a probabilistic variable. A multi-objective function with goals of loss minimization, reactive power reserve maximization and voltage security margin maximization is optimized using a four-stage multi-objective nonlinear programming. Then, using Monte Carlo simulation enhanced by scenario reduction technique, the proposed algorithm simulates actual condition and finds optimal operating strategy of DGs. Also, if any DGs are scheduled to operate in voltage droop scheme, the optimum droop is determined. Also, in the second part of the research, to enhance the optimality of the results, PSO algorithm is used for the multi-objective optimization problem. Numerical examples on IEEE 34-bus test system including two wind turbines are studied. The results show the benefits of voltage droop scheme for mitigating the impacts of the uncertainty of wind. Also, the results show preference of PSO method in the proposed approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the influence of coolant injection on the aerodynamic and thermal performance of a rotor blade cascade with endwall film cooling. A seven blade cascade of a high-pressure-rotor stage of a real gas turbine has been tested in a low speed wind tunnel for linear cascades. Coolant is injected through 10 cylindrical holes distributed along the blade pressure side. Tests have been preliminarily carried out at low Mach number (Ma(2is) = 0.3). Coolant-to-mainstream mass flow ratio has been varied in a range of values corresponding to inlet blowing ratios M-1 = 0-4.0. Secondary flows have been surveyed by traversing a five-hole miniaturized aerodynamic probe in two downstream planes. Local and overall mixed-out secondary loss coefficient and vorticity distributions have been calculated from measured data. The thermal behavior has been also analyzed by using thermochromic liquid crystals technique to obtain film cooling effectiveness distributions. All this information, including overall loss production for variable injection conditions, allows us to draw a comprehensive picture of the aero-thermal flow field in the endwall region of a high pressure rotor blade cascade.

AB The electrification in remote islands whose electricity distribution network is not connected to the mainland's grid is mostly based on Autonomous Power Stations (APSs) that are usually characterized by a considerably high electricity production cost, while at the same time the contribution of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in these regions accounts for less than 10% of the total electricity generation. This actually results from the fact that despite the excellent wind potential of most of these islands, the wind energy contribution is significantly restricted from limits imposed to protect the remote electrical grids from possible instability problems, due to the stochastic wind speed behavior and the variable electricity consumption. On the basis of probability distribution of the load demand of a representative Greek island and the corresponding data related to the available wind potential, the present study estimates the maximum - acceptable by the local grid - wind energy contribution. For that reason, an integrated computational algorithm has been developed from first principles, based on a stochastic analysis. According to the results obtained, it becomes evident that with the current wind turbine technology, wind energy cannot play a key role in coping with the electrification problems encountered in many Greek island regions, excluding however the case of introducing bulk energy storage systems that may provide considerable recovery of the remarkable wind energy rejections expected.

AB The design and implementation of a new control scheme for reactive power compensation, voltage regulation and transient stability enhancement for wind turbines equipped with fixed-speed induction generators (IGs) in large interconnected power systems is presented in this study. The low-voltage-ride-through (LVRT) capability is provided by extending the range of the operation of the controlled system to include typical post-fault conditions. A systematic procedure is proposed to design decentralised multi-variable controllers for large interconnected power systems using the linear quadratic (LQ) output-feedback control design method and the controller design procedure is formulated as an optimisation problem involving rank-constrained linear matrix inequality (LMI). In this study, it is shown that a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) with energy storage system (ESS), controlled via robust control technique, is an effective device for improving the LVRT capability of fixed-speed wind turbines.

AB This paper presents a new control strategy for a small scale wind farm which is composed of both fixed and variable speed wind turbine generator systems. Fixed speed wind generators (FSWGs) are largely dependent on reactive power, so they require large reactive power when a short circuit fault occurs in the power system. Otherwise the FSWGs become unstable and have to be disconnected from the power system. In this paper, a new wind farm topology is considered, where series connected fixed speed WTGs are installed with variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driven by doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs). A new direct power control (DPC) strategy based on discrete space vector modulation (DSVM) technique is applied for DFIG-based wind turbine system. No extra power or current control loops are required, simplifying the system design and improving transient performance. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed topology is a cost effective solution and simplified system design to minimize voltage fluctuation of both fixed and variable speed WTGs as well as to improve the transient stability of the wind farm.

AB This paper presents a new synchronization algorithm for grid connection of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) in a variable speed wind generation system. Stator flux-oriented vector control for back-to-back PWM converters in the DFIG rotor circuit is used for synchronization process. By controlling the rotor d-axis current, the magnitude of the stator EMF is adjusted to be equal to the grid voltage. PLL circuit is used to compensate for the phase shift between the stator EMF and the grid voltage. By controlling the turbine pitch angle, the generator speed is determined to adjust the stator frequency to be equal to the grid. The experimental results show a smooth synchronization and fast dynamic responses. Compared to the existing DFIG synchronization algorithms, the proposed method gives fast starting and can take only 2 cycles to be performed and has satisfactory performance and better robustness than existing methods.

AB A Variable Ratio Gearbox (VRG) can be used in the drivetrain of a small to medium-size wind turbine to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Currently, all commercially-available wind turbines operate using a fixed-gear ratio between the turbine rotor and electrical generator. A VRG allows wind turbines, with a constant-speed generator, to discretely vary rotor speed and to achieve greater aerodynamic efficiency. The authors' previous results demonstrate the viability of the VRG design. This research quantifies the gain in efficiency for a VRG-enabled wind turbine based on wind data from representing all seven wind classifications. A method is also presented to identify turbine sites that provide the VRG with the greatest opportunities to increase production. The overall findings suggest that the VRG can benefit all wind turbines, irrespective of wind class, with some wind profiles in the study experiencing gains greater than 10%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigates the condition monitoring of wind turbine wound rotor and doubly fed induction generators with rotor electrical asymmetries by analysis of stator current and total power spectra. The research is verified using experimental data measured on two different test rigs and numerical predictions obtained from a time-stepping electromagnetic model. A steady-state study of current and power spectra for healthy and faulty conditions is performed to identify fault-specific signal changes and consistent slip-dependent fault-indicators on both test rigs. To enable real-time fault frequency tracking, a set of concise analytical expressions, describing fault frequency variation with operating speed, were defined and validated by measurement. A variable speed study, representative of real wind turbine operations, of current and power frequency components for healthy and faulty conditions was then carried out on one test rig, which could simulate wind conditions. The current and power fault frequency tracking previously identified achieved reliable fault detection for two realistic wind turbine generator fault scenarios of differing severity. Conclusions are drawn on the relative merits of current and power signal analysis when used for wind turbine wound rotor induction machine fault detection and diagnosis.

AB In this paper, a torque control algorithm of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) for Direct Drive Wind Turbines (DDWTs) is proposed. In particular, a twelve-phase PMSG with four independent three-phase output subsystems has been considered with the aim of improving the DDWT torque management, energy efficiency, power generation and reliability; these goals are achieved by means of the decoupled control of each three-phase subsystem which the generator is split in. Hence, a novel coordinate transformation and the synthesis of the proposed master control algorithm are introduced: this last one allows the independent management of the reference currents of each subsystem and, thus, permits the development of an efficient variable speed wind turbine control. In addition, using the proposed DDWT, a novel topology of Continuous Medium Voltage Distribution system (CMVD) for a wind power plant is presented. In particular, the DC subsystems power outputs are connected by means the proposed CMVD to a centralized cascaded H-Bridge inverter structure, which is the only interface between the electric power transmission network and the wind power plant. The goodness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by means of a simulation study carried out in the Matlab Simulink environment, whose results are presented in the paper.

The proposed control scheme uses stator flux-oriented vector control for the rotor side converter bridge control and grid voltage vector control for the grid side converter bridge control. The stability analysis of the proposed sliding mode controller under disturbances and parameter uncertainties is provided using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally simulated results show, on the one hand, that the proposed controller provides high-performance dynamic characteristics, and on the other hand, that this scheme is robust with respect to the uncertainties that usually appear in the real systems.

AB A novel full-size wind power conversion system based on a multiphase permanent magnet synchronous generator (MPPMSG) and hybrid multi-converter system using 3-level neutral-point-clamp converters (3L-NPC) for high-power direct-drive wind turbines is proposed in this study. Higher efficiency, lower harmonics is achieved by replacing the traditional 2-level converter cells with 3-level cells. Circulating current is eliminated by using hybrid connection for multiphase generator design to replace the commonly used parallel converter structure for 3-phase generator design, the issues for neutral-point voltage imbalance is also eliminated. The mathematical model of MPPMSG and variable-speed control strategy are built and verified in PSCAD/EMTDC. A 3.5 kVA MPPMSG prototype machine and a set of hybrid 3L multi-converter systems are built. The experimental results validate the model and the effectiveness of the control strategies.

AB The paper deals with a squirrel cage induction generator connected to the grid through a back-to-back converter driven by vector control. The stator-side converter controls the generator torque by means of an indirect vector control scheme. In order to reduce the system dependance from the mechanical system behavior, a torque loop is used in the current reference calculations. Moreover, a torque control is included in the stator-side control in order to overcome a voltage dip fault. The grid-side converter controls the DC bus voltage and the reactive power in order to accomplish the grid codes. The proposed control strategy is evaluated by the simulation of different scenarios such as variable wind speed and different levels of voltage sags by means of Matlab/Simulink (R).

AB (I)n order to study the impact of a wind farm on the dynamics of the power system, a significant issue is to develop appropriate equivalent models that allow characterizing the dynamics of all individual wind turbine generators (WTGs) composing the park. In this sense, with the advance of power electronics, direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) have drawn increased interest to wind turbine manufacturers due to their advantages over other variable-speed WTGs. These include the possibility of multi-pole design with a gearless construction that offers slow speed operation and reduced maintenance since no brushes are used, elimination of the excitation system, full controllability for maximum wind power extraction and grid interface, and easiness in accomplishing fault-ride through and grid support. In this way, this paper presents a comprehensive dynamic equivalent model of a wind farm with direct-driven PMSG wind turbines using full-scale converters and its control scheme. The proposed simplified modelling is developed using the state-space averaging technique and is implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The dynamic performance of the wind farm and its impact on the power system operation is evaluated using the phasor simulation method. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

After the description of the test bench, the elements constituting the WECS are presented. Then, a real time model implemented under a digital signal processor (DSP) system is established. The first objective of this work is to validate the functionality of the test bench leading to experiment some principles developed in theory. The second objective is to control the load connection voltages and the DC bus voltage. For the first control, two resonant controllers are used and for the second one, a dump load, connected to the DC bus, offers the possibility to maintain a balance between production and consumption in spite of wind fluctuations and load variations. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the test bench trying out in real time the behavior of a WECS supplying an isolated load. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are preferred over other variable speed generators because of their advantages in terms of economy and control. One of the problems associated with high wind power penetration DFIG systems, however, is the inability of their converters to work properly under extreme low voltage conditions. This article presents a decoupled P-Q control strategy of a supercapacitor energy storage system, interfaced through a STATCOM, for low voltage ride through as well as damping enhancement of the DFIG system. The STATCOM meets the reactive power need under the depressed voltage condition, while the supercapacitor caters to the real power unbalance. An extensive dynamic model of the DFIG system including a supercapacitor DC-DC buck-boost converter and the STATCOM circuit has been developed. The fault ride-thorough capability of the generator has been investigated for a severe symmetrical three-phase to ground fault on the grid bus. Simulation results suggest that the proposed decoupled control of the supercapacitor STATCOM control strategy can help the DFIG ride through extreme low voltage conditions for significant duration. The proposed control strategy also damps the electromechanical transients, and thus quickly restores normal operation of the converters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SIMULATION; PLACEMENT
AB In this paper a multi-level system design (MLS) algorithm is presented and utilized for a wind turbine system analysis. The MLS guides the decision making process for designing a complex system where many alternatives and many mutually competing objectives and disciplines need to be considered and evaluated. Mathematical relationships between the design variables and the multiple discipline performance objectives are developed adaptively as the various design considerations are evaluated and as the design is being evolved. These relationships are employed for rewarding performance improvement during the decision making process by allocating more resources and influence to the disciplines which exhibit the improvement. Simulation tools developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are employed in the wind turbine design analysis. The Cost Of Energy (COE) comprises the overall system level objective, while performance improvements at two technical design disciplines are pursued at the same time. The optimal design of the blade geometry for maximum Annual Energy Production (AEP), and the structural design of the blade for minimum bending moment at the root of the blade comprise the two technical design disciplines. Scalar metamodels are developed for linking the design variables with the performance metrics associated with the design of the blade geometry. Main characteristics of the wind turbine, namely, the rotor diameter, the rotational speed, the maximum rated power, the hub height, the structural characteristics of the blade, and the geometric characteristics of the blade (distribution of thickness, twist angle, and chord) are employed as design variables for the overall design analysis. The optimization results and the physical insight which can be gained through a sensitivity analysis for the optimal configuration are presented and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes an integrated sensorless control method for small variable-speed, fixed-pitch wind turbines with direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), which covers both partial- and full-load operation modes. In partial-load regime, the control system aims to maximize the wind energy conversion by keeping the wind turbine on its optimal power-speed characteristic, while in the full-load regime, when the generator reaches the rated power, the control acts over the rotor speed to create the condition of aerodynamic stall, and thus the output power is substantially reduced. Two PI controllers act on the generator speed and output power by measuring only two DC electrical quantities, i.e. voltage and current. The simulations accomplished with a reduced model and the experiments on a 2.2 kW laboratory test bench assess the effectiveness of the proposed control system. The results emphasize the performance of the proposed solution while also showing its limitations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with power extraction maximization of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine. These variable speed systems have several advantages over the traditional wind turbine operating methods, such as the reduction of the mechanical stress and an increase in the energy capture. To fully exploit this latest advantage, many control schemes have been developed for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control schemes. In this context, this paper proposes a second-order sliding mode to control the wind turbine DFIG according to references given by an MPPT. Traditionally, the desired DFIG torque is tracked using control currents. However, the estimations used to define current references drive some inaccuracies mainly leading to nonoptimal power extraction. Therefore, using robust control, such as the second-order sliding mode, will allow one to directly track the DFIG torque leading to maximum power extraction. Moreover, the proposed control strategy presents attractive features such as chattering-free behavior (no extra mechanical stress), finite reaching time, and robustness with respect to external disturbances (grid) and unmodeled dynamics (generator and turbine). Simulations using the wind turbine simulator FAST and experiments on a 7.5-kW real-time simulator are carried out for the validation of the proposed high-order sliding mode control approach.

AB Distribution of electricity to the rural areas, particularly in regions which have rough topography causes high costs and losses. Hybrid systems can provide electricity at a relatively economic price at these regions. This paper designs and tests a stand-alone hybrid system combining variable speed wind turbine (WT), fuel cell (FC) and battery. The main objective is to optimize the hydrogen utilization while guaranteeing the load balance implicitly as well as to achieve proper FC operation. To this end, a wind power prediction based controller is proposed in order to take action according to foreseen amount of power deficit or excess in the system. For the purpose of investigating the effects of predictions on the system efficiency, a case study is carried out on a coastal area with a high wind potential in Izmir, Turkey. The results obtained provide insights about the advantages of utilizing wind power predictions in a hybrid system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The preliminary experimental results have confirmed the viability of the scheme and represent a serious step toward the development of a generic virtually parameter independent controller for doubly excited machines. A wide range of applications is possible, including drive and generator systems with limited speed ranges (e.g., large pumps and wind turbines), where the cost savings of using a partially rated power electronic converter are significant.
