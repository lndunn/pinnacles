DE Wind turbine; new pitch controller; variable load; system frequency;
   wind power capacity; governor control system model
AB The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and environmental concern has given awareness on generation of renewable energy resources. Among the various renewable resources, wind energy seems to be promising solution to provide reliable power supply with improved system efficiency. As wind turbine output is proportional to the cube of wind speed, the wind turbine generator output fluctuates due to wind speed variation. This study investigates the influences of a new pitch controller & governor control system model on frequency of power system, when variable load has been considered. It is observed that system frequency can be maintained in acceptable level by using newly designed pitch controller & governor control system when several interconnected synchronous generators (SGs) are operated in different governor control modes with high wind power penetration, when the total capacity of SGs is considered as 100 MVA. Real wind speed data have been considered for this study. PSCAD/EMTDC software is used for simulation analyses.

AB This paper proposes a hybrid energy system combing solar photovoltaic and wind turbine as a small-scale for stand-alone applications. The proposed system consists of a variable-speed wind generator, wind-side converter, solar array, DC-DC converter and isolating DC load. The power control strategy is to extract the maximum energy from the photovoltaic array and wind turbine under varying climatic conditions. The SMC proposed in this paper, to controlling the output voltage of the DC-DC converter and the out voltage of the AC-DC converter, in order to maintain and stabilize the constant DC-link voltage in climatic and load variations. Furthermore, classical controls PI compared with the SMC. The results show that the SMC technique is more suitable than those classical controls. It improves the transient response and reduces the steady state error of the DC-link voltage because offers a very good way to implement a control action which exploits the inherent variable structure nature of converters. This paper too proposes a control strategy of a maximum power point of a stand-alone PV system using the SMC technique. The efficiency of the proposed control approach is compared with the traditional P&O technique. The MPPT proposed has good performances of the PV system. A simulation model for the hybrid energy system has been developed using MATLAB/Simulink.

DE Vector control; Fuzzy Controller; Induction generator; Saturation
AB This paper presents the voltage build up process and terminal voltage control of an isolated wind turbine powered induction generator driven by a variable speed wind turbine using fuzzy logic control (FLC) associated with rotor field oriented vector control. Here three-phase induction generator is excited using a PWM inverter/rectifier connected to a single capacitor on the DC side. Wind powered isolated induction generators have an input, wind, which is not controllable. Unlike a grid connected induction generator, in an isolated induction generator there should be a control system that keeps the DC bus voltage at a constant value when the speed of the rotor is varied. FLC allows a more intuitive approach to design which is due to being based on qualitative relations used in everyday language, and also have certain advantages over other conventional controllers such as the classical PI controller, it have the capability of handling uncertain and noisy signals and do not require the knowledge of a detailed mathematical model of the system. The simulation of the system was done with Matlab/Simulink. During voltage build up the variation of magnetizing inductance is taken into consideration.

AB The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is one of the mostly used options in variable-speed wind power generation. The present paper deals with the transient behavior of the DFIG during network voltage dips. The dynamic model used for the transient analysis of the DFIG during network disturbances is presented. Vector control strategy is used to ensure independent control of the active and reactive powers. In order to illustrate the behavior of the DFIG during network disturbances, two symmetrical voltage dips are applied the DFIG stator terminals. These voltage dips are both selected within the limits set by the grid codes considered in the present paper. Simulation results showing large transient stator and rotor currents are presented and discussed. Finally, the mostly used technique to ensure a low voltage ride-through capability for the DFIG and to minimize the effects of grid disturbances on the doubly fed induction generator is reviewed.

AB This paper addresses the problem of control of wind power generator in variable speed. Sliding mode control strategy presents attractive features such as robustness to parametric uncertainties of the different components of the system. In this way, sliding-mode control laws are proposed for the purpose of generating the maximum power, regulating the DC link voltage and providing unity power factor. The Lyapunov method is employed to guarantee the reaching and sustaining of sliding mode and stability of the control system.
   Evaluation of the consistency and performance of the proposed sliding mode control approach has been established on a 3MW three-blade wind turbine. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of MPPT control strategy and reactive power regulation to guarantee unity power factor.

AB The variable-speed wind turbines are gaining more prominence due to their ability to generate power for a wide range of wind speeds. This class of turbines requires a fraction of the power be drawn from the grid in order to deliver the promised power when there is a deficiency in wind speed. For this purpose, a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) with a bidirectional converter (AC-DC-AC) on the rotor side is employed. The back-to-back converter controls the flow of energy from the machine to the grid and vice-versa. The Direct Power Control algorithm is used to control the power delivered by the stator to the grid. In this paper, the Space Vector Modulation (SVM) technique using the PI-controllers is used for controlling active and reactive powers. The SVM algorithm triggers the power electronic devices of the converter resulting in improved input current waveform. The paper discusses the simulation results of 1.5 MW DFIG machine connected to the grid via back-to-back converter.

The system includes a power conditioner which consists of a diode rectifier powered by a phase shifting transformer and it is then cascaded to a pulse width-modulated (PWM) voltage source inverter. The simple maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategy determines the optimal active reference current which is controlled by the active current of the grid-side PWM inverter. The MPPT algorithm tracks the maximum power of the wind turbine. The advantage of the this system is that the cost can be reduced and grid side MPPT control provides better performance and provides maximum power from wind energy to the load

AB The major part of the existing research works concerning variable speed wind turbines control is not only to capture the maximum power from the wind but, also, to improve the quality of power and to converge the system for operating at unity power factor. This paper proposes a new power control of a variable speed wind energy conversion system based on a doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) using space vector modulation to achieve control of active and reactive powers exchanged between the stator of the DFIG and the grid to ensure a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) of a wind energy conversion system and to reduce significantly Powers and Torque ripples. The SVM control is applied to rotor side converter for active and reactive power control and voltage regulation of wind turbine. This new approach is validated by modeling using Matlab-Simulink software and simulation results can prove the excellent performance of this control as improving power quality and stability of wind turbine.

AB This paper deals with the problem of controlling aeorogenerators consisting of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) coupled to a wind turbine. It is well known that fixed speed operation entails nonoptimal energetic efficiency of the aerogenerator. Various solutions have been proposed to achieve an optimal varying speed control. However, in most controllers it is require that wind speed distribution along the turbine blades is known. The point is that reliable wind speed sensors for turbines are not available. In this work, a nonlinear control law of variable speed wind energy is developed using Backstepping approach that involves online wind speed estimation based on an energy balance of the generator. The control objective is threefold: (i) tracking the maximum available wind power to ensure the achievement of maximum power point (MPPT) based on the wind speed estimate; (ii) regulating the rotor flux by controlling the stator reactive power; (iii) ensuring the constant DC link voltage. The performances of the wind estimator as well as the control laws are validated by simulation studies with MatlabiSimulinke environment.

AB The study of a Wind Farm (WF) based on Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and interconnected to the electric network is presented. The 8 MW wind farm consists of 4 PMSGs based 2 MW generators connected to a common DC bus. Each generator is connected to the DC bus with a rectifier while the DC bus is connected to the grid through one DC/AC converter. The proposed control law combines Sliding Mode Variable Structure Control (SM-VSC) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control strategy to maximize the generated power from Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). Moreover, considering the variation of wind speed, both converters used the SM-VSC scheme. The PMSGs side converters are used to achieve MPPT, while the grid-side converter regulates DC-link voltage and injects the generated power into the AC network. Accordingly, WF system not only can capture the maximum wind energy, but also can maintain the frequency and amplitude of the output voltage with unity power factor. The effectiveness of the control strategy is verified by simulation analyses using Matlab/Simulink.

In fact the liberalization of electricity market and the development of decentralized production, induce many scientific and technical problems in electrical engineering and thus renewable energy production. It is obvious that these problems come from the technology integrated into the electrical grid, which influence the global management of the distribution system. That's why it is important to make sure that these decentralized productions participate actively in the grid integration
   A particular study of these networks is highlighted in this paper. The integration of a particular wind turbine of 1.5 MW and its impact on the distribution network will be presented. The simulations of scenarios of these systems are carried out with Matlab Simulink TM.

The knowledge of the power coefficient requires absolutely estimating the mechanical power supplied by the wind turbine of the system. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) associated to a PMSG model is used to reconstruct angular velocity and position. Generally the WECS manufacturer provides the power output characteristic. Hence, the wind speed and power coefficient can be deduced by knowing the rotor angular speed. All the used measurement points are stored as a database to allow a deep study and a good estimation and knowledge of the system.

AB This paper studies performances of wind energy conversion system (WECS) using Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). The big interest and requirements to high efficiency imposes the wind turbine to operate in variable speed mode, which inevitably requires power electronic converters to maximize the extracted power from the wind as well as decoupling generator dynamics from the grid or load. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of the suitable topology among the most popular rectifier systems for the generator-side converter those are: the passive diode bridge rectifier and the active six-switch two level rectifier, another rectifier system considered in this study include combinations of a diode bridge rectifier and DC-DC converter, the half controlled rectifier topology is also discussed. This work provides a comparison study between performances of different rectifier systems to examine their performances in (WECSs) starting by modeling of the used converters in the rectifier system, then a comparison is made between the association of (PMSG-diode rectifier) and (PMSG-diode rectifier with DC-DC buck converter), then with fully controlled rectifier, in order to discover their influences on the performances of the PMSG and the wind turbine system. Simulation results using Matlab Similink are presented to support the conclusion.

   First of all; on the basis of the experimental tests; we characterized and modeled a small wind turbine with a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator PMSG and an internal rectifier.
   Second, on the one hand, we have proposed a numeric control "Perturb and Observe" (P&O) in order to work at various wind speeds and to optimize the power generated by the wind turbine, and on the other hand we have controlled the flow of the transmitted power.
   The formal model of the generator has been validated, and the results of the different simulations of the whole conversion chain using the environment MATLAB/ Simulink, allowed us to evaluate the performance of the suggested system.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear power control strategy for a grid connected Variable Speed Wind Energy Generation System (VS-WEGS) based on a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). The proposed system includes a wind turbine (WT) and a PMSG connected to the grid by back-to-back voltage source converter (VSC). The generator side converter is employed to control the speed of the generator with MPPT, and the grid side regulator controls the reactive power flow, the dc link voltage and the power factor during wind variations. The efficacy of the VS-WEGS can be greatly improved by using an appropriate control. So, this work explores a sliding mode control strategy to maximize the energy production of a VSWEGS. The conditions for the existence of the sliding mode are found by applying Lyapunov stability theory. The performance of the system has been demonstrated under varying wind conditions and under a grid voltage dip. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed sliding mode control.

AB In this paper, a sliding mode control is proposed to control a large wind turbine (3 MW). Sliding mode control is considered more robust than the linear controllers. The complete model of the conversion system of wind energy is established. It includes a wind turbine, a gearbox, a variable speed squirrel cage asynchronous generator, two PWM converters, DC bus circuit and the filter. The side-generator converter is used to generate the maximum power from Wind Turbine Generator. Then, the control strategy, which combines maximum power point tracking and a pitch control, is given. The grid side converter is used to maintain the DC link voltage constant, to achieve unity power factor, and injects the generated power into AC network. The models and control schemes are validated through simulations by using MATLAB/ Simulink environment. The results of simulation show that the proposed control is efficient and gives good performance.

AB In this paper, artificial neural network sliding mode (ANNSM) controller is designed for a variable speed wind turbine in order to optimize the energy captured from the wind. Sliding mode control (SMC) approach can be used for a variable speed wind turbine. However, in the presence of large uncertainties, the SMC produces chattering phenomenon due to the higher needed switching gain. In order to reduce this gain, artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer is used to estimate the uncertain parts of the system plant with on-line training using backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The learning rate is one of the parameters of BP algorithm which have a significant influence on results; Adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm with global search capabilities is used in this study in order to improve the network performance in terms of the speed of convergence. The stability is shown by the Lyapunov theory and the control action used did not exhibit any chattering behavior. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated in simulations by the comparison with traditional sliding mode control.

AB Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) has been widely used in variable-speed Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). The aim of this paper is to present a comparative study in term of the dynamic performances between two classical controllers Proportional Integral ( PI) and Integral Proportional (IP) to control a DFIG during grid faults, which are represented by a voltage dip on all three phases of the grid voltage. Firstly, we are developed the model mathematic of the generator. Then, we introduced the technical of stator-flux-oriented vector control to decouple the stator active and reactive powers to simulate the behaviour of the wind turbine generator during fault conditions.

AB In the absence of aerodynamic pitch control, it is required to drive the wind turbine at an optimal speed for a given wind speed to extract maximum power from a wind turbine generator system. Due to unpredictable wind speed fluctuations, operating at maximum power point is a difficult task to undertake. This paper presents a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm for variable speed wind turbines. The strategy uses neural networks and genetic algorithms to learn the wind turbine's nonlinear dynamic model and achieve accurate tracking. As such, robustness to unpredictable wind uncertainties is achieved. Simulation results for different situations highlight the performance of the proposed controller under various wind speed operating conditions.

AB In close future, with high Wind Power (WP) penetration in the power system, the burden of Load-Frequency Control (LFC) is gradually shifted to Variable Speed Wind Turbines (VSWTs). In order to equip the VSWT with LFC capability to support the grid during sudden load-generation imbalance, sufficient reserve capacity should be procured. This paper addresses the LFC scheme offered by VSWT. Feedback loop of locally measured voltage and frequency data is employed to improve transient and permanent response to achieve faster and more efficient LFC action and voltage regulation. The proposed scheme demonstrates remarkable improvement in transient state of both voltage and frequency profiles in comparison with conventional LFC designs provided by Central Power Plants (CPP) or Wind Power Plants (WPP). Numerical simulations carried out in DigSilent PowerFactory confirm the superiority of proposed methodology used in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSG) connected to 9-bus IEEE standard test system.

AB This paper presents a new topology of hybrid AC-DC standalone system based on solar photo-voltaic (PV) array and wind turbine (WT) feeding three-phase four-wire loads. The proposed hybrid system employs two back to back converters and dc-dc boost converter to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To balance the power at the PCC, the system is reinforced by BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) to keep constant frequency and voltage and to improve the power quality. The dump load is added to the system and is placed at the common dc bus to manage the extra power when the battery is fully charged. The capacitor bank is used to provide the reactive power to the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The proposed system is studied for various types of linear, nonlinear and dynamic loads and under varying climate conditions. The dynamic behavior of the proposed system is verified using MATLAB/Simulink.

Grid connected wind energy conversion system (WECS) present interesting control demands, due to the intrinsic nonlinear characteristic of wind mills and electric generators. The ANN torque compensation is feed-forward to increase the robustness of the wind driven induction generator system. The proposed controller is designed to drive the turbine speed to extract maximum power from the wind and adjust to the power regulation. When sliding mode occurs on the sliding surface, the control system acts as a robust state feedback system. Moreover, a sliding mode speed controller is designed based on a sliding surface.

AB Wind turbine generator system(WTGS) is a complex multi-varies nonlinear system with the characteristics of time-varying, strong coupling and multi-interference. Wind speed is affected by many factors, the magnitude and direction are random. There are numerous of factors such as temperature, weather, environment and so on that affect wind turbine generator system, result in the WTGS cannot be guaranteed safety operation and constant output power. With the characteristic of strongly nonlinear, delay and uncertainty, the WTGS cannot be given an ideal control using traditional PID controller. Although the neural network control can solve the problems of nonlinear and uncertainty, it belongs to nonlinear approximation in essentially and cannot eliminate the error in steady state. In order to improve wind turbines behavior, an adaptive control method based on RBF-PID neural network is presented in this paper. This algorithm synthesizes the mechanical and electrical characteristics. System identification is part of the controller. At high wind speed, pitch angle is adjusted to keep rated output power using neural network adaptive controller. The RBFNN is used as the identifier of the WTGS. According to the identification information and the given learning speed, PID parameters are modified on line. The Matlab simulation results at random wind speeds show the controller can effectively improve the performance of variable pitch control.

AB This paper discusses the operation of a multiphase system, which is aimed at both variable-speed drive and generating (e. g., wind energy) applications, using back-to-back converter structure with dual three-phase machine-side converters. In the studied topology, an asymmetrical six-phase induction machine is controlled using two three-phase two-level voltage source converters connected in series to form a cascaded dc link. The suggested configuration is analyzed, and a method for dc-link midpoint voltage balancing is developed. Voltage balancing is based on the use of additional degrees of freedom that exist in multiphase machines and represents entirely new utilization of these degrees. The validity of the topology and its control is verified by simulation and experimental results on a laboratory-scale prototype, thus proving that it is possible to achieve satisfactory dc-link voltage control under various operating scenarios.

AB The purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical review of wind turbine-generator systems for stand-alone applications. The review focuses on variable-speed wind turbines, as the future trend in wind energy conversion, in contrast with the traditional fixed-speed wind turbines. Indirect-drive and direct-drive turbines are comparatively evaluated. The concerns about long-term availability of permanent magnet materials and its impact on the future of permanent magnet synchronous generator are addressed. Having cost and efficiency in mind, viability of indirect-drive squirrel cage induction generator for stand-alone wind energy conversion systems is discussed. As an efficient induction machine design, permanent magnet induction generator is also examined. Finally, the potential of using switched reluctance machine, as a generator, in a direct-drive wind turbine system is investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to fully study small wind turbines (WTs), a comprehensive model that considers all mechanical and electrical aspects is necessary. The permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based WT is one of the most common types of WTs that uses a full scale converter with a variable speed WT. In this paper, a new model is developed for a PMSG-based WT with yaw control scheme. The WT generator is connected to a grid by two back-to-back voltage source IGBT converters and a dc capacitor set between them. A precise mechanical model is necessary to simulate yaw control. The yaw control is used as a mechanical mechanism to adjust yaw error and protect small horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) against over speed and excess power. TurbSim and FAST are used to model a wind profile and the mechanical parts of the WT. Also, the WT generator and electrical controllers are modeled by Simulink. Field oriented control (FOC) method is developed on the voltage source converters (VSCs). Simulation results show the performance of the mechanical and electrical controllers in different conditions.

AB This paper presents a new overall control strategy for small-scale wind energy conversion systems (WECS). The purpose of the proposed strategy is to utilize a maximum power point tracking control (MPPT) to maximize the captured energy when the wind speeds are below the rated speed. For high wind speed region; two stall controllers are developed: The constant speed stall controller which will limit the rotational speed of the generator to its rated value, and the constant power stall controller, which will regulate the captured power to be within the system rating. For the MPPT control, a modified perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm is utilized, where the dc side current is used as a perturbation variable and the dc-link voltage slope information is used to enhance the tracking speed and stability of the algorithm. For the speed and power regulation operation during high wind speeds, the system is controlled in the stall region to limit the rotational speed and the power of the generator. A stabilizing control loop is proposed to compensate for the stall region instability. A new mode transfer control strategy is developed to effectively control the transition between different modes of operation while ensuring the system stability without using any preknowledge of the system parameters. A 1 kW hardware prototype is developed and tested to validate the proposed new control strategy.

AB In the near future, a smart grid will accommodate customers who are prepared to invest in generation-battery systems and employ energymanagement systems in order to cut down on their electricity bills. The main objective of this paper is to determine the optimum capacity of a customer's distributed-generation system (such as a wind turbine) and battery within the framework of a smart grid. The proposed approach involves developing an electricity management system based on stochastic variables, such as wind speed, electricity rates, and load. Then, a hybrid stochastic method based on Monte Carlo simulation and particle swarm optimization is proposed to determine the optimum size of the wind generation-battery system. Several sensitivity analyses demonstrate the proper performance of the proposed method in different conditions.

SO ENERGY SCIENCE & ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Control method; experiments; variable speed; VAWT; wind turbine
AB A novel control method for a fixed-pitch variable speed wind turbine is introduced and experimental results are presented. The measured absorbed power and rotational speed, together with a look-up table for the aerodynamic efficiency, are used to estimate the wind speed reaching the turbine as well as the tip speed ratio. Thereby, the control is independent on wind speed measurements and the wind turbine itself is used as an anemometer. Tip speed ratio control is implemented by comparing the estimated tip speed ratio to a reference value and adjusting the DC voltage level accordingly. Tip speed ratio control benefits from that the aerodynamic efficiency hardly varies with changing tip speed ratio when close to its optimum value. Experimental results from a 200 kW vertical axis wind turbine are presented. The voltage from the permanent magnet generator is passively rectified and the alternating DC voltage is then inverted, filtered, transformed, and grid connected. The estimated wind speed is compared with the measured wind speed. The absorbed power when tip speed ratio control has been implemented is shown. It is concluded that the presented control method works and some future improvements are discussed.

AB This paper presents an optimal efficiency control strategy for wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) with squirrel cage induction generators (SCIGs). The developed control scheme provides an optimal efficiency of the induction generator and maximum power extraction from the wind turbine. Thus, maximum power harvesting from the whole WECS is achieved and additionally expansion of the exploitable wind speed region toward the lower speed range is accomplished. A minimum electric loss (MEL) controller is introduced to minimize the generator electric loss and a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller is used to maximize the wind turbine output power. Common input to the two optimal controllers is only the generator speed, while the measurement of the wind speed is not required. The controllers determine the optimal d- and q-axis stator current components of the SCIG through optimal conditions and, therefore, fast dynamic response of the WECS is accomplished. An experimental procedure is proposed to determine the MEL and MPPT controller parameters. Therefore, neither the knowledge of SCIG loss model, nor the characteristic curves of the wind turbine are required. The effectiveness and the operational improvements of the suggested optimal control scheme have been verified experimentally.

AB Failure of the drivetrain components is currently listed among the most problematic failures during the operational lifetime of a wind turbine. Guaranteeing robust and reliable drivetrain designs is important to minimize the wind turbine downtime as well as to meet demand in both power quantity and quality. While aeroelastic codes are often used in the design of wind turbine controllers, the drivetrain model in such codes is limited to a few (mostly two) degrees of freedom, resulting in a restricted detail in describing its dynamic behavior and assessing the effectiveness of controllers on attenuating the drivetrain load. In the previous work, the capability of the well-known FAST aeroelastic tool for wind turbine has been enhanced through integration of a dynamic model of a drivetrain. The drivetrain model, built using the Simscape in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, is applied in this paper. The model is used to develop a power-electronics-based controller to prevent excessive drivetrain load. The controller temporarily shifts the closed-loop eigenfrequency of the drivetrain through the addition of virtual inertia, thus avoiding the resonance. Simulation results demonstrating the fidelity of the expanded drivetrain model as well as the effectiveness of the virtual inertia controller are presented.

AB Utilization of wind energy in modern power systems creates many technical and economical challenges that need to be addressed for successful large scale wind energy integration. Variations in wind velocity result in variations of output power produced by wind turbines. Variable power output becomes a challenge as the share of wind energy in power systems increases. Large power variations cause voltage and frequency deviations from nominal values that may lead to activation of protective relay equipment, which may result in disconnection of the wind turbines from the grid. Particularly community wind power systems, where only one or few wind turbines supply loads through a weak grid such as distribution network, are sensitive to supply disturbances. Energy storage integrated with wind turbines can address this challenge. In this paper, Li-ion capacitors are investigated as a potential solution for filtering power variations at the scale of tens of seconds. A novel topology and control technique has been introduced to integrate capacitors and power conversion circuitry. Modeling and scaled-down experimental results are provided to verify the theoretical analyses.

DFIGs can be used as reactive power sources to control the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). The controller is designed to compensate for the voltage at the PCC by simultaneously regulating the reactive and active power generated by WTs. The performance of the controller is evaluated in different case studies considering a different number of wind farms in different locations. Simulations carried out on a real 37-bus weak distribution system confirmed that the proposed controller can enhance the FRT capability.

AB Today, variable speed operation of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is becoming popular in the wind power industry (PI). A variable speed wind turbine (VSWT)-driven PMSG, in general, is connected to the grid using a fully controlled frequency converter (FC). Along with the generator side converter, the FC necessitates the grid side inverter system that has a great impact on the stability issue of the VSWT-PMSG, especially in the case of network disturbance. The well-known cascaded- controlled inverter system has widely been reported in much of the literature, where multiple PI controllers are used in inner and outer loops. However, a fuzzy logic controller deals well with the nonlinearity of the power system, compared to a PI controller. This paper presents a simple fuzzy logic controlled inverter system for the control of a grid side inverter system, which suits well for VSWT-PMSG operation in a wide operating range. This is one of the salient features of this paper. Detailed modeling and control strategies of the overall system are demonstrated. Both dynamic and transient performances of VSWT-driven PMSG are analyzed to show the effectiveness of the control strategy, where simulation has been done using PSCAD/EMTDC.

AB Nowadays, the power generation systems based on wind turbines is increasing continuously in the world. Hence, there are intense efforts provided by researchers for the development of this area. In high power system applications, multilevel converters are a competitive alternative to the two-level inverters. In this paper, a three-level sparse matrix converter (SMC3l) associated to a grid connected variable speed wind generation (VSWG) scheme using a doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) is investigated. Therefore, the dynamic behavior of a wind generator, including models of the wind turbine, DFIG, SMC3l control algorithm and power control is studied. Simulation results of the dynamic models of the wind generator are presented, for different operating modes sub-synchronous, synchronous and hyper-synchronous, to show the good performance and the efficiency control enhancement of the VSWG system using the proposed SMC3l.

AB A wind power system state estimation method based on automatic differentiation technique is presented in this paper. A simplified RX model of wind turbine is introduced and used to be equivalent to wind power generator. As one of the state variables, the slip of wind power generator is introduced into state estimation process and the corresponding mathematical model is established. The proposed method takes into account the own characters of asynchronous generator and can easily combine with the original state estimation program. Furthermore, unlike the traditional method which needs to deduce all the formulas of derivatives and code them by hand, the Jacobian matrix is built automatically using automatic differentiation with sparse technique in the proposed method, the truncation error is avoided effectively, and the computational efficiency, speed and precision can be significantly improved. This paper demonstrates that the burdens of software developers are relieved greatly by automatic differentiation technique instead of hand-coded derivatives and the simplified RX model instead of the traditional RX model. Finally, it follows from the simulation results that the proposed method possesses good performance and can be well applied to state estimation for power system containing wind power generators.

AB This paper applied balanced truncation based model order reduction of wind farms. Starting from a simplified and linearized model of a variable speed wind turbine generator, operating under maximum power tracking, the state space representation of a wind farm is considered. With wind velocities as input, and farm power as the output, the Hankel singular values are computed. These indicate the likely order to which the farm may be reduced to. It is found that reduced model matches well with the initial cluster centers of the distribution of inertia of the WTGs present in the original wind farm. The reduced order model retains the dynamic relationship between the variation in wind speed and consequent power output variations accurately over a wide range of frequencies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The impact of large penetration of wind power on the transient stability of multi-machine power systems is discussed in this paper. Variable speed wind farms with doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) are considered. A new index based on the sensitivity of the DFIG terminal voltage is used to assess the transient stability margin of power systems, both for constant wind speed condition and during a sudden change in wind speed. Suitable locations for connecting the DFIG to an existing power system are identified with the help of this index. The effect of increase in wind power penetration on the transient stability condition of the existing power system is studied. The proposed index is also used to select the optimum crowbar resistance during fault ride-through operation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based standalone variable-speed constant-frequency systems reported so far cannot supply nonlinear unbalanced load current containing cophasor components. This paper presents three topologies of a stand-alone DFIG which can handle this type of load. The harmonic/imbalance component of the load current in each case is supplied by the stator-side converter. In the first option, Delta/Y transformer with neutral connection supplies the load. However, the harmonic current circulating in the delta winding still distorts the load phase voltage beyond the acceptable limit. As a solution, the zero-sequence load voltage is actively controlled through the stator-side converter with the load neutral connected to the midpoint of the dc-link capacitor. However, this configuration also fails when the load current contains dc component as in half-wave rectifiers. Finally, a configuration with an additional inverter leg connected to the load neutral is proposed in conjunction with the zero-sequence stator voltage controller. Simulation and experimental results from this last configuration demonstrate its excellent load voltage regulation property while supplying various nonlinear and unbalanced loads. The control algorithm is implemented without any speed/position sensor.

AB While tidal stream patterns of natural channels are essentially consistent and smooth, coastal tidal flows experience much more radical speed variations. This paper proposes a new converter control strategy for maximum power extraction of the fast-changing currents that are typically seen in open waters and near the shore. The proposed method makes use of variable-speed generation and has the ability to adapt to the nature of different tidal flows, thus enabling efficient exploitation of resources that require faster dynamic responses. The main motivation behind this study has been the exploration of the possibility of combined offshore wind-tidal cogeneration. The aspects discussed in this paper include interdependences between the injection of the fluctuating generated power, grid-tie connection, and maximum power capture with a view to addressing energy conversion and power quality requirements. Detailed insights into this novel power generation system are provided with a case study that involves a method for maximum power point tracking and power injection controls in a nonstiff network.

AB This paper presents a novel type of variable speed wind turbine with a new drive train different from the variable speed wind turbine commonly used nowadays. In this concept, a synchronous generator is directly coupled with the grid, therefore, the wind turbine transient overload capability and grid voltage support capability can be significantly improved. An electromagnetic coupling speed regulating device (EMCD) is used to connect the gearbox high speed shaft and synchronous generator rotor shaft, transmitting torque to the synchronous generator, while decoupling the gearbox side and the synchronous generator, so the synchronous generator torque oscillations during a grid fault are not transmitted to the gearbox. The EMCD is composed of an electromagnetic coupler and a one quadrant operation converter with reduced capability and low cost. A control strategy for the new wind turbine is proposed and a 2 MW wind turbine model is built to study the wind turbine fault ride-through capability. An integrated simulation environment based on the aeroelastic code HAWC2 and software Matlab/Simulink is used to study its fault ride-through capability and the impact on the structural loads during grid three phase and two phase short circuit faults.
