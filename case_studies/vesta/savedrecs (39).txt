ID FED INDUCTION GENERATOR
AB Nowadays, the most widely used variable speed machine for wind turbine above 1MW is the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). As the wind power penetration continues to increase, wind turbines are required to provide Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) capability. Crowbars are commonly used to protect the power converters during voltage dips. Its main drawback is that the DFIG absorbs reactive power from the grid during grid faults. This paper proposes an improved control strategy for the crowbar protection to reduce its operation time. And a simple demagnetization method is adopted to decrease the oscillations of the transient current. Moreover, reactive power can be provided to assist the recovery of the grid voltage. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.

AB In this paper, a speed-adaptive full-order flux observer for sensorless vector control of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) is proposed. The observer is a simulation of the full-order electrical model of DFIGs with feedback of the rotor current estimation error and a speed adaptation loop. The observer gains are selected based on a stability analysis and validated by the linearized closed-loop observer model. Simulation results demonstrate desired steady-state and dynamic performance of this sensorless control approach for DFIG-based variable speed wind turbines.

DE Wind turbine; particles swarm; optimal control
AB In order to get the maximum power from the wind, the variable-speed turbine should run at different speed when wind speed changes. The dynamic characteristics of the control system must be properly defined and designed to achieve satisfactory generated power quality and system security, availability and reliability. Therefore great attention has to be kept in the theoretical design task, as well as in the experimental validation phase, in order to assure the correct operation of the control system both in normal and in perturbed conditions. This paper presents the design of an PI controller, the control system is trained to find the gain of the regulator by minimizing the overshoot and the tracking error. The tuning problem is solved with optimizing by Particles Swarm; the speed of synchronous generator is controlled in the wind turbine, the system is connected to a chopper converter represented by, a variable resistive load, the turbine uses the model of rigid axis. in order to development and test the control system the model in the system coordinate of the rotor is used.

ID CONDUCTION MODE
AB This paper presents the application of average current mode control to reduce the THD(i) and increase the PF in a Three-Phase Boost Rectifier driving a small wind turbine. It is used as the input stage of small wind turbines with permanent magnet generators operating at variable speed. The Boost Rectifier output is connected to an inverter which injects the energy to a distribution power grid The operation in discontinuous conduction mode allows significantly reducing the Total Harmonic Distortion of the current in the small wind turbine. However, it is necessary to add an input filler so that the switching ripple doesn't affect the small wind turbine. It is evaluated the convenience of the current sensors placement in the DC side of the rectifier or at the output of the generator. The results demonstrate that it is better to place the sensors at the output of the generator, because it is achieved a smaller THD(i) and a higher PF.

   Today the penetration level of wind power on the network is high. The power system stability defined as the ability of the system, for given initial operation condition, to regain a normal state of equilibrium after being subjected to a disturbance is the major problem. In numerous papers the stability problems are pointed out and there are also many papers describing control strategies for wind turbine equipped with DFIG.
   In this paper we study dynamic behavior of the DFIG during voltage sag. Also we study the ability of the control to improve the stability of the system.

AB Wind turbine generation has been in operation for both on-site and commercial uses. However, one major obstruction of the wind turbine generation is its uncertainty. As known, the wind power is dependent on the cube of wind speed, which varies over time. To obtain the maximum wind power, variable-speed Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) are operated. As a result, fluctuation of power output occurs. Inevitably, this brings about the fluctuation of system frequency. This paper proposes a method of integrating storage battery system to the Load Frequency Control (LFC). The proposed model comprising of WTGs, hydro power plants, batten, system, loads, and control systems - shows that the frequency fluctuation is attenuated effectively. In addition, the impact of battery time constant and storage capacity has been investigated.

AB In this paper, a fuzzy logic controller has been developed to obtain a stable current output adjusting the modulation index of a multilevel converter in a variable speed wind turbine system. The variable speed wind turbine system has been modeled containing a squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG), and SPWM controlled AC-DC-AC converter which is constituted of a 6-pulse rectifier and 3-level multilevel inverter. The simulation of the power conversion system has been evaluated using Matlab/Simulink and Fuzzy Toolbox.
   The input parameters have been modeled with a variable voltage-variable frequency (VVVF) generating system according to various wind speeds. The input values of converter have been limited between 350-700V and 40-60Hz. The fuzzy logic controller tracks the input values and controls the converter in order to supply desired current output. The control process has been developed selecting the most accurate modulation index for multilevel inverter which directly affects the output power.

AB With the advance of power electronics, direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generators have drawn increased interest to wind turbine manufacturers due to its advantages over other variable-speed wind turbines. This article studies permanent magnet synchronous generator characteristics under the general d-q control strategy in the rotor-flux-oriented frame so as to benefit the development of advanced permanent magnet synchronous generator control technology. Compared to traditional approaches, the specific features of the article are (1) a steady-state permanent magnet synchronous generator model in a d-q reference frame, ( 2) a simulation mechanism that reflects the general permanent magnet synchronous generator d-q control strategy, (3) an integrative study that combines generator-converted power with extracted wind power characteristics, and (4) a joint investigation incorporating both steady-state and transient evaluations. Extensive simulation-based analysis is conducted to study how permanent magnet synchronous generator characteristics are affected by different d-q control conditions and are interacted with wind power drive characteristics in power generation and speed regulation of a permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbine.

AB This paper applies new maximum-power-point tracking (MPPT) algorithms to a wind-turbine generator system (WTGS). In this paper, the WTGS is a direct-drive system and includes the wind-turbine, permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous generator, three-phase full bridge rectifier, buck-boost converter and load. The new MPPT method uses gradient approximation (GA) algorithm. Three methods based on GA for achieving MPPT are discussed in this paper: (1) full-sensor control with anemometer and tachometer, (2) rule-based method and (3) adaptive duty cycle method. The third method has merits of no PID parameters, proportional constant, anemometer, tachometer and characteristics of WTGS required. This method enables the permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) to operate at variable speeds to achieve good performance. Simulation results show that the tip-speed ratio (TSR) and power coefficient obtained by the adaptive duty cycle method with GA can be almost identical to the optimal values. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Wind turbine systems; Pitch control; Braking chopper control
AB Variable speed wind turbine generators provide the opportunity to capture more power than fixed speed turbines. However also the limitation of the produced power is an important issue. The paper is focused on the management of the power in excess in a variable-speed wind turbine equipped with a PMSG (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator) connected to the grid through a back-to-back converter. It is investigated the role of the braking chopper to dissipate the power in excess that can not be injected in the grid and the blade pitch control to limit the aerodynamic power in above-rated wind speeds in order to keep the turbine within its design limits. The interaction between the blade pitch control and the braking chopper is discussed. Finally, some simulation results in the case of a ramping wind speed and under real wind conditions are reported.

The dynamic modeling allows to know the response of the turbine generator system in the whole range of operation. In this study, it is proposed a variable structure control scheme with two different kind of operation, namely Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and Constant Power (CP). In the CP region, it is demonstrated that the system is controllable with the speed control loop while that using torque control an unstable control loop results.

AB In this paper, the low voltage ride-through (LVRT) capabilities of an hybrid wind plant is studied. The hybrid wind plant considered combines fixed speed wind turbines (FSWTs) based on classical induction generator and full power converter variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs) with permanent magnet generator. However, it must be able to respect grid code requirements. A specific control of the variable speed wind turbine power converters is proposed and described in this paper to support FSWTs during voltage dips: the gride side converter is used as a STATCOM during voltage drop to provide the maximum of reactive power. Simulation results show the ability of the wind plant to ride-through a voltage dip with this control.

Engineers point out stability problems and unequal heating of semiconductors and windings as the main reasons. The latter problem is consequence of unequal losses distribution in the semiconductors and rotor windings. This work investigates the thermal behaviour of the inverter switches at this singular point with the help of semiconductor loss and thermal models described along the text. Simulation results of the junction temperatures under different operating conditions are presented and analysed. These results should help on the dimensioning of the semiconductors and possible strategies to avoid the unequal heating are pointed out.

AB Although decreases in the cost of energy from utility scale wind turbine generators has made them competitive with conventional forms of utility power generation, further reductions can increase the presence of wind energy in the global energy mix. The cost of energy from a wind turbine can be reduced by increasing the annual energy production, reducing the initial capital cost of the turbine, or doing both.
   In this study, the cost of energy is estimated for a theoretical 1.5 MW wind turbine utilizing a continuously variable ratio hydrostatic drive train between the rotor and the generator. The estimated cost of energy is then compared to that of a conventional wind turbine of equivalent rated power.
   The annual energy production is estimated for the theoretical hydrostatic turbine using an assumed wind speed distribution and a turbine power curve resulting from a steady state performance model of the turbine. The initial capital cost of the turbine is estimated using cost models developed for various components unique to the hydrostatic turbine as well as economic parameters and models developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) for their 2004 WindPACT advanced wind turbine drive train study.
   The resulting cost of energy, along with various performance characteristics of interest, are presented and compared to those of the WindPACT baseline turbine intended to represent a conventional utility scale wind turbine.

AB The reduction in cost of energy of wind turbines requires many technical contributions from all areas of the Wind Energy Conversion System. The variations in the wind (e.g. Diurnal, Monthly, Seasonal and Long term) as normally shown on probability density distributions directly affect the wind turbine performance. The turbine power output is also dependent upon a number of other variables, and a lot of research has been carried out to increase the power coefficient that has an upper limit of 0.593 called the Betz Limit. A possible way for improving the power output of a turbine is to control the swept area by controlling the diameter of the rotor. Ideally the wind turbine designer will use the long term mean wind speed to design and establish the rated power output of the wind energy conversion system. The stochastic nature of wind will fluctuate the power output of the turbine. Therefore to maintain the design rated power of the turbine, the telescopic wind turbine concept can be used. When the wind speed drops, the telescopic blades extend in order to maintain the power output, and when the wind speed increases, the telescopic blades retract in order to reduce the loads on the system. By telescoping the blades, the capacity factor of the wind energy conversion system is thus enhanced. The wind energy characteristic of a region in New Zealand was studied and the results show an 18% increase in annual energy production of a 10 kW wind turbine with telescopic blades.

AB In partial load torque control for variable speed wind turbine generators(VSWTG) rotational speed, which will be feedback signal, is very important parameter. The mathematical model of wind turbine and control regulation for maximizing energy conversion yield has been introduced in this paper. The control system stability and dynamic response are analyzed when using the wind turbine rotor side rotational speed (RSRS) and the generator side rotational speed(GSRS) as feedback signal in torque control respectively,and the effect the drive train damping and wind speed on system stability are investigated simultaneously. Analysis- and simulation results show that when using RSRS the stability of wind turbine control system depends on the damping of drive train and the coming wind speed strongly, while lite system will he always stable in partial load torque control when using GSRS although wind speed and damping have some effect on the wind turbine system stability. Two real wind turbines of 1.5MW double fed asynchronous generator(DFIAG) are simultaneouly tested with different feedback rotational speed respectively. Test results show that, when using RSRS the generator rotational speed will fluctuate strongly with severe torsion vibrations its higher wind speed, while the wind turbine operate normally for GSRS feedback, which make a very good agreement with analysis- and simulation results.

AB Doubly fed induction generators based wind turbines are today one of the most widely used generation systems in wind farms. The stator is directly connected to the constant frequency three phase grid and the rotor currents are appropriately controlled to vary the slip power thereby enabling variable-speed constant-frequency operation. Instead of using encoder for rotor position estimation, a novel digital PLL method based on analog traditional PLL and model reference adaptive system is firstly presented and implemented in this paper. The converter of DFIG with power decoupling control and speed sensor-less is designed. Simulation results illustrate that the presented method (digital PLL) can well measure the rotor speed and position and the power decoupling control of converter based on the rotor speed and position from speed sensor-less is realized excellently.

AB Currently, some of the variable speed wind turbine on market have some low-voltage through capacity (LVRT), but do not have dynamic reactive power support capacity under fault.DFIG can't provide dynamic voltage support, in addition, as a result of lower terminal voltage, active power can not be completely output, which has impact on safe and stable operation of power grid. Aimed at this problem, this paper discussed how to improve the reactive power support capacity during grid fault such as three-phase voltage dip fault and presented a improved LVRT technology. First, the paper analyzed the transient responses and characteristics of DFIG under grid voltage fault and introduced several control strategies and protection programs of DFIG under voltage dip existing now; then, based on the traditional control strategy, the paper presented a transient voltage control strategy in rotor-side converter which can make DFIG output more reactive power to participate in the transient voltage control of whole grid during voltage dip in grid fault and during the recovery process after the fault to ensure that the terminal voltage of generator maintain the value before fault; finally, the EMTDC / PSCAD simulation showed that adopted transient voltage control strategy in rotor-side converter, the transient voltage control in rotor-side converter can output a large number of reactive power during fault according to the dip depth of terminal voltage to provide dynamic voltage support and insure the fast recovery of grid voltage.

AB The recent development of power electronic technology encourages to use variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driving a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), wound field synchronous generator (WFSG) or permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) for wind power generation. Among those, stability analysis of DFIG type of VSWT has already been reported in many literatures. On the other hand, stability analysis of synchronous generator type of VSWT is not sufficient enough. This paper focuses on the transient stability analysis of variable speed wind turbine driving a PMSG (VSWT-PMSG). Suitable control strategies are developed for both wind turbine and frequency converter. Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults are considered as a network disturbance in the simulation analyses of the transient characteristics of the proposed system, which have been carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC.

AB One of the foremost issues in the wind power generation is the output power fluctuation of wind generator due to the random variation of wind speed. Wind turbine generator systems (both fixed and variable speed types) more or less undergo within the power fluctuation dilemma. In addition, fixed speed wind generator suffers from terminal voltage fluctuation. This is because the fixed capacitor bank connected to its terminal cannot maintain constant terminal voltage due to the wind speed variation. This paper proposes an energy capacitor system (ECS), composed of electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) and power electronic converters, to smoothen output power and terminal voltage fluctuations of grid connected fixed speed wind farm. The exponential moving average (EMA) is introduced to generate the power reference of ECS. Another salient feature of this study is the generation of hydrogen by using wind generator output power. Effective topology of wind power and hydrogen generation system with cooperatively controlled ECS is proposed from the cost and performance points of view.

AB In this paper a methodology for calculation of the optimum size of a stand-alone hybrid wind/photovoltaic (wind/PV) system is developed. The collection of six months of data of wind speed and ambient temperature recorded for every hour of the day and an estimate of solar irradiance were used. These data and manufacturer's specifications on a wind turbine and a PV module were used to calculate the average power generated by the wind turbine and the PV module for each hour of the day. A deterministic algorithm is used to minimize the life cycle cost of the system while guaranteeing the satisfaction of the load. The mathematical modeling of the principal elements of the hybrid wind/PV system is exposed showing the main sizing variables. The deterministic algorithm is presented and implemented to minimize the objective function.

AB Vibration measurement and lubrication oil analysis are used in wind turbines (WT) as condition monitoring systems (CMS). However, they do not provide a complete solution to the WT CMS problem. The former measurement is sophisticated with high hardware costs, suffering from spurious alarms; the latter monitors the wear and fatigue of gears and bearings, but cannot detect electrical abnormalities occurring in the WT generator and electrical system. So, a simpler, cheaper but moreover globally comprehensive WT CMS is still needed, especially if the WTs are to go offshore, where the), are confronted with higher risks and difficulties of access. To meet this requirement, a new WT condition monitoring technique has been researched in this paper. As the WT operates over a widely varying power range, dependant on the stochastic variations of the wind, the monitoring signals are usually non-stationary. In view of this, a wavelet-based adaptive filter is designed to extract the power energy at prescribed, fault-related frequencies which vary with time. The energy information obtained is then used as an indicator of WT condition. The central frequency of the filter is adaptive to the average rotational speed of the generator, and the filter bandwidth depends upon the fluctuation of wind speed. By using this filter, fault features can be extracted whether the WT runs at fixed or variable speed. The proposed technique has been experimentally validated on a WT Test Rig using both synchronous and induction generators as exemplars. Experiments prove that the proposed technique is efficient in assessing the WT condition for both mechanical and electrical abnormalities.

AB Most of the turbine-generator groups using renewables as primary energy (small hydro plants or wind farms) do not optimally provide the electric power when they have to operate at constant speed in order to supply the electric energy at the rated frequency. In this paper a solution that enables such a generator to operate at highest possible efficiency, i.e. at variable speed, is presented. An ac-dc-ac interface is developed in order to facilitate the integration into distribution networks. For several generators case, the PCC is a DC bus bar which allows a more stable operation and an easier droop control, converting a typical MIMO system into a SISO one.

AB This paper describes a preliminary study of a 30 kW doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) used for wind turbine applications. Wind represents a variable-speed intermittent source of energy in nature and can be controlled to be a nearly constant speed but variable-torque input to the wind turbine using blade pitch angle regulation. Wind profile at the installation site is investigated so as to derive parameterized wind speeds, more importantly, the annual cubic-mean speed. This is taken account into the machine design since the machine efficiency varies with turbine mechanical inputs. By coordinating the loss components, it is possible at the machine design stage to select the maximum efficiency to be near the actual optimized load, in a long run, to maximize the overall energy production of the generator. The DFIG is modeled in Matlab with a vector control. The total energy production is used as a key criterion to refine the machine design.

The presented technique is based on an optimal control method in order to improve the system global dynamic. A set of linear local models (sub-models) is then defined for different operating points corresponding to high wind speeds. Thereafter, a global asymptotic stability analysis is developed by solving a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) feasibility problem based on the local stability of the sub-models.

AB Modern wind turbines are capable to work in variable speed operations. These wind turbines are provided with adjustable speed generators, like the double feed induction generator. One of the main advantage of adjustable speed generators is that they improve the system efficiency compared to fixed speed generators because turbine speed is adjusted as a function of wind speed to maximize output power. However this system requires a suitable speed controller in order to track the optimal wind turbine speed reference. In this work, a sliding mode control for variable speed wind turbines is proposed.
   The stability analysis of the proposed controller is provided under disturbances and parameter uncertainties by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally simulated results show, on the one hand that the proposed controller provides high-performance dynamic characteristics, and on the other hand that this scheme is robust with respect to the uncertainties that usually appear in the real systems.

AB This paper deals with an isolated wind-hydro hybrid generation system employing one Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by hydro turbine and another PMSG driven by a variable speed wind turbine feeding three-phase four-wire local loads. The proposed system utilizes two back to back connected Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) based voltage source converters (VSCs) with a battery energy storage system (BESS) at their dc link. The main objectives of the control algorithm for VSCs are to achieve maximum power tracking (MPT) through rotor speed control of a wind turbine driven PMSG under varying wind speeds, and control of the magnitude and the frequency of the load voltage. The proposed wind hydro hybrid system is having capability of bidirectional active and reactive powers flow, by which it controls the magnitude and the frequency of the load voltage. The proposed electro-mechanical system using PMSGs, a MPT controller and a voltage and frequency controller (VFC) are modeled and simulated in MATLAB using Simulink and Sim Power System (SPS) set toolboxes and different aspects of the proposed system are studied for various types of linear loads and nonlinear loads and under varying wind speed conditions. The performance of the proposed system is presented to demonstrate its capability of MPT, VFC, harmonic elimination and load balancing.

AB The low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of a MW-Level variable speed wind turbine with a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is investigated. A new control scheme for the wind turbine that allows it to be connected to the grid during transient gird faults is designed and simulated. This control scheme emphasizes the regulation of the dc-link voltage. The simulation study of the wind turbine system is conducted using PSCAD/EMTDC, and the results show the effectiveness of the introduced control scheme to improve LVRT capability of variable speed wind turbines with PMSG.

AB In this paper, a 1.5 kW Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (IPMSG) with a power conditioner for grid integration of a variable-speed wind turbine is developed. The power-conditioning system consists of a series-type 12-pulse diode rectifier powered by a phase shifting transformer and then cascaded to a PWM voltage source inverter. The PWM inverter is utilized to supply sinusoidal currents to the utility line by controlling the active and reactive current components in the q-d rotating reference frame. While the q-axis active current of the PWM inverter is regulated to follow the optimized active current reference so as to track the maximum power of the wind turbine, the d-axis reactive current can be adjusted so as to control the power factor. In order to track the maximum power of the wind turbine, the optimal active current reference is determined by using a simple MPPT algorithm which requires only three sensors. Moreover, the phase angle of the utility voltage is detected using a simple electronic circuit consisting of both a zero-crossing voltage detecting circuit and a counter circuit employed with a crystal oscillator. The laboratory results indicate that the proposed scheme provides a viable solution for the grid integration of the variable-speed wind turbine using a cost-effective, high efficiency power conditioner.

AB Modern wind systems generate electrical energy running at variable rotational speed. Operating as energy generation plants they present a stochastic behavior dependent on random wind speed. So operation performance becomes an issue when it is approached integration into the grid either in terms of quality of delivered power or in terms of generated power available to the Transmission System Operator. The communication deals with real performance of two types of wind systems integrated into a wind farm. Both the systems are modern ones, running at variable rotational speed, being one based on synchronous electrical generator, another one on asynchronous electrical generator. Approaching a wind system as a production unity whose output is dependent on a stochastic input the authors analyze behavior of the wind systems with the method "Data Envelopment Analysis". The performed analysis allows at concluding on optimization methods not only driven by theoretical analysis of the wind system but by real operation of the systems. According to global behavior in terms of energy generation the authors discuss some of the reasons for the results found. They conclude pointing out needs of integrating control actions for the wind turbine and the electrical generator based on getting knowledge on the system through data preprocessing and pos-processing allowing at improving global operation.

AB Direct Torque Control (DTC) has been extensively researched and applied to most AC machines during the last two decades. Its first application to the Brush less Doubly-Fed Reluctance Machine (BDFRM), a promising cost-effective candidate for drive and generator systems with limited variable speed ranges (such as large pumps or wind turbines), has only been reported a few years ago. However, the original DTC scheme has experienced flux estimation problems and compromised performance under the maximum torque per inverter ampere (MTPIA) conditions. This deficiency at low current and torque levels may be overcome and much higher accuracy achieved by alternative estimation approaches discussed in this paper using Kalman Filter (KF) and/or Sliding Mode Observer (SMO). Computer simulations accounting for real-time constraints (e.g. measurement noise, transducer DC offset etc.) have produced realistic results similar to those one would expect from an experimental setup.

AB The paper presents an emerging technology of electricity generation based on decoupled theory. The decoupled generation system operates in wide speed range and control strategy is oriented to select regions of high efficiency of the driving engine. This system is used to operate in parallel with renewable energy source RES, which is unstable and not reliable. In case of high power available from the renewable, the decoupled adjustable speed generation reduces it speed, what results in low fuel consumption. However when the renewable source power decreases, the adjustable speed generation system increases its speed, following points of high efficiency of the driving Diesel engine. The paper presents topologies of the combined systems including variable speed, wind powered generation system and adjustable speed generation system driven by Diesel engine. The ability of adjustable speed to provide power is discussed.

AB The aim of this work is to analyze a typical configuration of a Wind Turbine Generator System (WTGS) equipped with a Variable Speed Generator. Nowadays, doubly-fed induction generators are being widely used on WTGS, although synchronous generators are being extensively utilized too. There are different types of synchronous generators, but the multi-pole Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) is chosen in order to obtain its model. It offers better performance due to higher efficiency and less maintenance since it does not have rotor current and can be used without a gearbox, which also implies a reduction of the weight of the nacelle and a reduction of costs. Apart from the generator, the analyzed WTGS consists of another three parts: wind speed, wind turbine and drive train. These elements have been modeled and the equations that explain their behavior have been introduced. What is more, the whole WTGS has been implemented in MATLAB/Simulink interface. Moreover, the concept of the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) has been presented in terms of the adjustment of the generator rotor speed according to instantaneous wind speed.

AB 1MW variable speed constant frequency wind turbine tower of steel structure is analyzed by using the software ANSYS, the coupling between the wind and the tower is realized through the order coupling method. The maximum Von Mises stress and the deformation of the tower in the case of limit loads are obtained, and then these results are compared with that without wind load. Comparison result shows that the effect of wind load on the tower's displacement along the wind speed is great, and the maximum Von Mises stress of the tower becomes larger after considering the influence of wind load, the increase extent is determined by wind load.

AB In this paper, an algorithm for finding out the optimal ratings of the machine and power electronic converters of a wind turbine driven stand-alone double output induction generator based variable speed constant frequency generation system is reported, which seeks to minimize the cost of energy generation. The nonlinear constrained optimization technique employed includes, among others, the reactive power balance constraints, which are not often considered for stand-alone systems. For this purpose, the load power factor is modeled as a random variable with known probability density function. The total energy captured is calculated for a given wind velocity density function and load power factor density function. The proposed method finally finds the optimum combination of machine and converter ratings, which results in minimum cost of energy. The effects of changes in load power factor and wind velocity distribution are also discussed in detail. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. [DOI: 10.1063/1.3076056]

AB This paper presents a sensorless control for a stall regulated variable speed wind turbine, where the speed reference is obtained from the estimated aerodynamic torque. The LQG/LTR methodology is applied to the design of an optimal discrete-time feedback controller for a Wind Energy Conversion System, aiming to maximize the efficiency on energy conversion and to minimize the detrimental dynamic loads due to wind fluctuation and ripple torque. The trade-off between the efficiency maximization of the energy conversion and the dynamic load effects minimization is considered in the quadratic cost function of the LQG/LTR design. The resulting control structure is simulated considering a step variation on wind speed. The performance of the proposed control scheme is discussed showing that it really leads the WECS operation near to the maximum efficiency point and reduces the detrimental dynamic loads. It is also presented some alternatives for sensorless control for the electrical generator.

AB Utilization of the power electronics converter in a doubly-fed induction generator wind turbine, thus decoupling mechanical and electrical frequencies and making variable-speed operation possible, can vary the electrical rotor frequency. This paper addresses the circumstances of no matter either capacitor voltage or inductor current is chosen as the output in a converter, the zero dynamics is not both stable for two power flow direction cases. A passivity-based controller for back-to-back converter is presented to avoid this problem in wind power generation. Based on the port-controlled hamiltonian model of the converter, the structure matrix and the damping matrix are collocated and the desired equilibrium is approached rapidly. Simulation studies are carried out in Matlab/Simulink and the results show that the new control method enables to avoid instability for a bidirectional use of the power converter in DFIG wind turbine.

This technology was developed by to reduce the cost of supplying electricity in remote communities. The optimal wind penetration (installed wind capacity/peak electrical demand) for this system depends on the site availability of hydro energy and available wind resource. The optimal solution is evaluated first using HOMER - special design software for optimizing cost exploitation for a hybrid power systems. For the optimum solution we analyze the system by means of simulation in order to present the system behavior during normal operation.

AB The optimal aerodynamic design of Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) is investigated. The Blade-element/Momentum model is used for the aerodynamic analysis.
   In the first part of the paper a simple design method is derived, where the turbine blade is optimized for operation at a specific wind speed. Results of this simple optimization are presented and discussed. Besides being optimized for operation at a specific wind speed, without considering operation at other wind speeds, the simple model is also limited in the choice of design goals (cost functions), design variables and constraints.
   In the second part of the paper a comprehensive design method that is based on a mixed numerical optimization strategy, is presented. This method can handle almost any combination of: design goal, design variables, and constraints. Results of this method are presented, compared with the results of the simple optimization, and discussed.
