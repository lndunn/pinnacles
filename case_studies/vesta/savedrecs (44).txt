ID PERFORMANCE; DESIGN
AB This paper presents a unique axial-flux permanent-magnet synchronous generator (AFPMSG), which is suitable for both vertical-axis and horizontal-axis wind turbine generation systems. An outer-rotor design facilitates direct coupling of the generator to the wind turbine, while a coreless armature eliminates the magnetic pull between the stationary and moving parts. The design and construction features of the AFPMSG are reviewed. The flux-density distribution is studied, with the aid of a finite element software package, in order to predict the generated e.m.f. waveform. The performance equations of the AFPMSG are derived, and the condition for maximum efficiency is deduced, for both constant-speed and variable-speed operations. The experimental results, in general, confirm the theory developed.

AB Harmonic emissions of variable speed wind turbines (WTs) are 4 well-known issue, but little information that is based on field measurements on actual machines has been published on the subject. In this paper, the harmonic behavior of modern WTs using extensive measurements performed on commercially available machines is discussed. Specific issues addressed include the shape and the frequency range of the harmonic current spectrum, the variation of the harmonics with the WT operating point, the statistical characteristics of their magnitude and phase angle, the effect of grouping and time-averaging, as well as their symmetrical component characteristics. The objective of the paper is to outline important general characteristics of the harmonic behavior of WTs, rather than to analyze specific machines or compare alternative WT designs.

AB Tidal current turbines extract kinetic energy from tidal current in much the same way as wind turbines do with wind. Tidal current velocities are by nature slow and variable, whereas electricity generation typically requires fast and steady rotary motion. This article investigates the performance of a hydraulic transmission system based on Digital Displacement(TM) technology, which allows variable speed of the tidal current turbine rotor while maintaining constant generator shaft speed. The case study of a generic horizontal axis tidal turbine is considered. Control strategies based on rotor variable speed are derived to optimize yearly power generation and to cope with short-term variations in stream velocity.

AB The wind power probability density function is useful in both the design process of a wind turbine and in the evaluation process of the wind resource available at a potential site. The continuous probability models used in the scientific literature to estimate the wind power density distribution function and wind turbine energy output assume that air density is independent of the wind speed. A constant annual value for air density of 1.225 kg m(-3), corresponding to standard conditions (sea level, 15 degrees C), is generally used. A bivariate probability model (BPM) is presented in this paper for wind power density and wind turbine energy output estimations. This model takes into account the time variability of air density and wind speed, as well as the correlation existing between both variables. Contingency type bivariate distributions with specified marginal distributions have been used for this purpose. The proposed model is applied in this paper to meteorological data (temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed) recorded over a one year period at a weather station located at the facilities of the Technological Institute of the Canary Islands (Spain). The conclusion reached is that the BPM presented in this paper is more realistic than the univariate probability models (UPMs) normally used in the scientific literature. In the particular case under study, and for all the situations analysed, the BPM has provided values for the annual mean wind power density and annual energy output of a wind turbine that fit the sample data better than the UPMs. However, as a result of the climatological characteristics of the area where the analysis was performed, the results do not differ notably from those obtained through the use of a UPM and the mean air density of the area.

ID SPEED
AB Wind energy has experienced remarkable growth over the last decade, due in part to renewed public support and maturing turbine technologies. But often hidden from public view are the difficulties and challenges associated with introducing a new technology into an older electrical system of established infrastructure. Many early wind turbines utilized a squirrel-cage or wound-rotor induction generator to produce electricity. These generators allowed small variations in rotor speed thus improving energy capture and reducing torque shocks caused by wind gusts. However, they absorbed large amounts of reactive power and sometimes caused severe voltage stability problems on the grid. This paper explores some of the solutions that have resulted over the years, including the introduction of two new variable-speed generator types, doubly-fed induction and synchronous machines. It also considers the evolution of new grid codes and turbine improvements that make wind energy more grid-compatible to ensure further growth of this promising renewable source of energy.

A control system is implemented to provide proper operation of the SRG as well as power tracking capabilities for varying wind speeds. The control system for the grid side inverter that will allow the SRG to properly generate power to the system is also presented. Studies are presented of both the SRG and inverter control systems capabilities during a balanced three-phase fault. The paper will demonstrate that the SRG based wind turbine presents a feasible variable wind speed solution with good fault response capabilities.

The results from simulations show that voltage unbalance affects both the induction generator and the rotor converter, due to the high unbalanced currents generated. The ability to modify the control strategy of a DFIG to compensate for voltage unbalance is outlined and simulations show the improvements to the performance of the DFIG.

AB The response of wind energy installations to gird disturbances is studied in this panel session contribution. For the variable-speed turbine installations, the influence of using various levels of reactive power in-feed from the wind energy installation is investigated. Recently voltage-source or current-source inverter based various FACTS devices have been used for flexible power flow control, secure loading and damping of power system oscillation. Some of those are used also to improve transient and dynamic stability of wind power plant (WPP). In this paper, we propose the static reactive compensator (STATCOM) based on voltage source converter (VSC) PWM technique to stabilize gird connected squirrel cage wind power plant. A simple control strategy of STATCOM is adopted at the wind generator terminal is needed. A new system control is used as the control methodology of STATCOM, rather than conventional controller. The steady state capacitor value used with induction generator is reduced by certain percentage when STATCOM is used with WPP. Comprehensive results are presented to assess the performance of the STATCOM connected with WPP. where the simulations have been done by Simulink/MATLAB.

AB This paper focuses on current harmonics mitigation at the Permanent magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) wind turbine system using a Variable Frequency Active Power Filter (VF-APF) harmonic mitigation technique. Mitigation of current harmonics in the PMSG reduces harmonic losses, thus reducing the heating effect on the PMSG cause by the current harmonic components and extends the lifespan of the PMSG. The current harmonies in the wind turbine system is mainly caused by non-linear loading effect from the AC-DC converter in the Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). Therefore, to filter current harmonics component in the PMSG, a conventional fixed frequency grid connected 3-phase-shunt APF is applied to compensate the current harmonics in the WECS PMSG generator. The conventional APF is coupled with a phase-lock-loop (PLL) synchronizer to facilitate variable frequency functionality. The simulation results shown in this paper is conducted at PMSG WECS maximum power point conditions. The demonstrated results show that the designed VF-APF successfully mitigates the PMSG current harmonic over a wide range of wind speed.

AB The paper describes a variable speed wind energy conversion scheme where fuzzy logic principles and matrix converter (MC) are used for efficiency optimization and performance enhancement. A squirrel cage induction generator feeds the power to an improved topology of MC which pumps power to a utility grid. The power factor at the interface with the grid is controlled by the MC to ensure purely active power injection into the grid for optimal utilization of the installed wind turbine capacity. Furthermore, the MC to avoid self-excitation capacitors satisfies reactive power requirements of the induction generator. The generation system has fuzzy logic control with vector control in the inner loops. Fuzzy controller tracks the angular frequency with the wind velocity to extract the maximum power and programs the machine flux for light load efficiency improvement. The complete control system has been developed, analyzed, and validated by simulation study.

In this paper, nonlinear control theory is used to handle couple between electrical and mechanical models in order to obtain nonlinear optimal control law and further implement three pairs decouple control structure. The technical works include: a new fourth-order control model of DFIG is derived; a novel nonlinear optimal control strategy based on input-output state feedback linearization theory for wind turbines with DFIG is presented; the simulation study and the test of low power hardware prototype of the proposed control scheme are carried out and partial results are presented. Results show the validity and efficiency of the proposed control strategy to improve the ride-through capability.

The harmonic standard and power system operation requirements for the converters are considered. And SVPWM with the on-off control is proposed to suppress the neutral point potential or fly-capacitor voltage deviation and drift for the three-level converters. The simulation models made by Simulink and Matlab are used to verify the designs and analyze power losses of the converters. And the performance and costs of three types of the converters are compared.

AB Actual wind power costs together with incentives and financing options for developing renewable energy facilities make wind energy source competitive with conventional generation sources and it is believed that wind energy will be the most cost effective source of electrical power in the next future. However the wind power production diffusion involves the development of efficient control systems able to improve wind systems effectiveness. Therefore, a design methodology, able to generate an adaptive fuzzy model for maximum energy extraction from variable speed wind turbines is proposed in this paper. The fuzzy model is designed by using fuzzy clustering combined with genetic algorithms (GA) and recursive least-squares (LS) optimisation methods. Some simulation results on a doubly-fed induction generator confirmed that the proposed design methodology is able to identify a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model exhibiting adaptivity, learning capability, high speed of computation and low memory occupancy.

ID DIRECT POWER-CONTROL
AB A modem variable speed wind turbine generator is connected to the lines (grid) through a both sides PWM controlled dc link voltage source inverter. The fast current control of the line currents by the line-side converter makes possible to compensate the deviation of the line currents from their fundamental component. This possibility can be used to compensate the lower order current harmonics in the line currents (injected by nonlinear loads on the lines) and to balance the negative sequence current component (caused by asymmetrical load). Besides, advanced control strategies make possible to control the reactive (and also the active) power of the lines, resulting in power factor correction. Since all the mentioned subjects of compensations require at most pulsating active power with zero mean value, the listed compensations are possible even at no-wind condition. Of course, the pulsating active power affects the pulsation of the dc link voltage, the limits of the compensations in this sense must be investigated. All the investigated additional application fields improve the power quality of lines (grid) where the wind turbine generator is connected to. The practical aim of this paper is to attract the attention of the wind turbine makers to these additional application fields. The paper presents the advanced possible line-side converter control schemes. The physical and theoretical background of the different compensations are discussed. The issues of their implementation by the presented control methods are detailed. The methods are investigated and validated by simulations of practical examples. Design criteria are given based on the considerations.

AB This paper proposes the variable-speed wind generator system using the boost converter. The proposed system has three speed control modes for the wind velocity. The control mode of low wind velocity regulates the armature current of the generator with the boost converter to control the windmill speed. The control mode of middle wind velocity regulates the DC link voltage with vector controlled inverter to control the windmill speed. The control mode of high wind velocity regulates the pitch angle of the wind turbine with the pitch angle control system to control the windmill speed. The hybrid of three speed control scheme extends the variable-speed range. The proposed system simplifies the maintenance, improves the reliability, and reduces the cost in compare with variable-speed wind generation system using PWM converter.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB In this paper, we present the voltage built up process and a control to regulate the DC voltage of an isolated induction generator connected to a rectifier and driven by a variable speed wind turbine. Two strategies, based on the rotor flux oriented vector control, are proposed. Both rotor flux and DC bus voltage are regulated by two control loops which operate in parallel. The model used for the induction generator is obtained by the application of the Park transform. This model takes account of the saturation effect by a variable magnetizing inductance function of the current. The inductance variation is described by a polynomial function. The proposed control strategies are validated through simulations. The obtained results are presented and discussed.

AB Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) are nowadays widely used in variable speed wind power plants. The behaviour of these machines during grid failure is an important issue, since in case of under voltage of the mains it is not allowed to simply disconnect the turbine but it is mandatory that it keeps on delivering power to the mains supply system. To protect the rotor side converter, a crowbar at the rotor has to be switched on. The performance of an active crowbar during voltage dips is investigated for several parameter sets of machine, resistor and control.

AB Large parallel network wind turbines generate power by transfer torsional power, which is captured by wind shroud and accelerated by driving chain, to electric machine rotor. The drive system of variable speed wind turbine mostly uses flexible connection. That kind of connection adjusts exciting current and operating condition when wind speed and rotary speed change. Thus, it is one of the main reasons of unstable load of driving-chain causing damages of gear case and main bearing. It also has a strong impact on generator's life-span. Therefore, reducing unstable load of driving-chain and tensional vibration are always the problems in wind turbine design. This paper brings forward an approach based on H infinity full state feedback control to reconstruct a needed load-damping-controller in wind generators. The reconstruction process is built on a sensitivity function aiming at inhibiting unstable torsion. The function is based on full state feedback factor K. Theoretical simulation results testify the feasibility of the new approach in reducing unstable load of driving-chain.

AB This paper described a Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-mode control method applied in the variable speed adjustable-pitch wind turbine, in order to solve the problems of non-linear, parameters time changing, anti-disturbance and time-lag, in which the pitch executor is driven by pitch control unit. The chattering brought by sliding mode switch control can be effective minimized by introducing adaptive in fuzzy sliding mode control, without sacrificing the absolute robustness of fuzzy sliding mode control. Simulation results verify that the proposed control scheme has strong robustness against the system parameter variations and load disturbance, and the chattering is obviously restrained. Simultaneously, the pitch system promises good static and dynamic performance.

AB Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) for variable speed wind turbines can capture more wind power. However active power and the reactive power have coupling characteristic to affect performance of conventional control. A multivariable predictive functional control (MPFC) based first-order model are proposed for doubly fed induction generator. Models the DFIG in d-q reference frame is given and are transferred first-order mode. The control law is optimized to obtain based multivariable first-order system. Decoupling task is part of MPFC algorithm. MPFC performances compared with PI with reference tracking and parametric robustness are carried out Results show MPFC has rapid response and better robustness.

AB The global electrical energy consumption is rising and there is a steady increase of the demand on the power capacity, efficient production, distribution and utilization of energy. T- his study focuses on the improvement of overall efficiency in the wind power generation systems(WPGS) by restricting the operation of the wind turbine to the optimal efficiency region, using a control strategy based on two chattering-free! sliding mode controllers (SMCs). One of the designed SMCs performs wind turbine speed control, while the other controls the generator torque. The control strategy is designed and simulated by using the Matlab/simulink. The performance of the control strategy is compared with that of the original model for the wind turbine torque, generator volt/current and the model with the auxiliary power unit (AP- U) In this study, in spite of the simple modeling approach taken to model the APU and the optimal efficiency region, an improved performance has been achieved with the new SMC based the strategy.

AB Offshore wind turbines, incorporating electrical generators and converters, operate in locations where accessibility can lead to long mean times to repair. Conditionbased maintenance is therefore essential if cost-effective availability targets are to be reached. As yet the condition monitoring techniques appropriate for offshore win turbines have not been resolved. Reliability studies have shown that the majority of failure modes in wind turbines are concentrated in drive train subassemblies, including the electrical generator and converter, and are heavily affected by wind conditions. A 30 kW test rig has been constructed, with features similar to a wind turbine drive train, to enable the development of the signal processing techniques necessary for this variable speed, high torque variation application. The test rig includes a low speed shaft, high speed shaft, gearbox and an electrical generator and can be driven by simulated wind conditions. The test rig can also be used to inform the selection of appropriate monitoring instrumentation for offshore wind turbines. A series of condition monitoring approaches have been investigated on this test rig, using measured torque, speed, shaft displacement and gearbox vibration to detect faults. By the use of appropriate signal processing techniques, chances to load conditions, properties of the gearbox and cod faults can be detected.

   First, the possible increment in power is determined, limiting both current and losses in the machine to their rated values, but allowing an increase in terminal voltage. Next, the increment in captured energy for different wind distributions is assessed.
   Finally, the required power rating of the converters in the secondary system is estimated, taking into account that in the proposed system they have the extra task of extracting from the generator and sending to the utility the extra generated power.

AB Within various topologies of variable-speed wind turbine systems, PWM converters are employed either as grid interface or as motor dive or both. According to the particular requirements for dynamic response of MPPT and utility grid connection, a real-time control strategy adopting instantaneous current regulation with ac-side voltage feedforward correction is proposed. The mathematical model of the system with neutral line suitable for the method is given and the dc voltage control and compensation are also devised. The digital implementation makes it feasible in practical wind energy conversion systems (WECS) and the experimental results are provided demonstrating the satisfactory dynamics of currents and effective restriction for lower order harmonics.

ID FED INDUCTION MACHINE; ORIENTED CONTROL
AB The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is a 'special' variable speed induction machine and is widely used as modern large wind turbine generators. It is a standard, wound rotor induction machine with its stator windings directly connected to the grid and its rotor windings connected to the grid through an AC/DC/AC PWM converter. The AC/DC/AC converter normally consists of a machine-side converter and a grid-side converter, both of which are controlled by decoupled d-q control approaches. In order to gain proper control of a DFIG and appropriate DFIG integration with the grid, it is important to understand the power control characteristics of the two AC/DC converters. This paper focuses on the analysis of traditional decoupled d-q vector control approaches for control of DFIG wind turbines. A typical d-q control concept that has been used widely in DFIG converter control is reviewed in the paper. Then, detailed study is performed to investigate the power control characteristics of DFIG converter using decoupled d-q control approaches. Deficiencies of conventional d-q control mechanisms are discovered and analyzed both analytically and through computer simulation. An extensive simulation study is performed to examine the power control characteristics of DFIG PWM converter under different d-q control conditions.

AB Operation of variable speed wind turbine generator (WTG) in the above-rated region characterized by high turbulence intensities demands a trade-off between two performance metrics: maximization of energy harvested from the wind and minimization of damage caused by mechanical fatigue. This paper presents a learning adaptive controller for output power leveling and decrementing cyclic loads on the drive train. The proposed controller incorporates a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and a neurocontrotter (NC) and regulates rotational speed by specifying the demanded generator torque. Pitch control ensures rated power output. A second-order model and a stochastic wind field model are used in the analysis. The LQG is used as a basis upon which the performance of the proposed paradigm in the trade-off studies is assessed. Simulation results indicate the proposed control scheme effectively harmonizes the relation between rotor speed and the highly turbulent wind speed thereby regulating shaft moments and maintaining rated power.

AB Larger wind power integration in the power system requires generated power regulation in wind farms. In this work, an active power control system for wind farms equipped with variable speed wind turbines is proposed, aiming at minimizing the active power variations due to wind speed variations. The proposed control scheme achieves the active power regulation goal without significative reduction in total power production of the wind farm, and takes advantage of the non-uniform wind distribution along the farm. Employing suitable tools for wind power forecast, such performance can still be improved. With this methodology, the wind power generation drawbacks are reduced, allowing a better integration of the wind energy into the power system.

AB High voltage DC transmission using voltage source converters is a quite new technology for the interconnection of offshore wind farms. It facilitates variable frequency operation in the wind farm grid, which can be used for improving the performance of the wind turbines. In this paper a new approach for the coordinated control of voltage source converter based HVDC and wind turbines equipped with doubly-fed induction generators is introduced. Variable frequency can be used to reduce the machine slip. Thus a lower rated converter is sufficient for the same speed range. Alternatively, the slip-limiting operation can be used for extending the speed range while keeping the converter rating at the same level. The basics of variable frequency operation of doubly-fed induction generators are discussed, and the performance is evaluated by a simulation model in MATLAB/Simulink.

AB The parameter variation problem in controller design for wind turbine generator (WTG) systems due to wind speed fluctuations is addressed in this paper The wind speed is generated by an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model while drive-train components are modelled as a two-mass system described by non-linear equations for accurate dynamic performance assessment. The control of the unit is exercised through a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) self-tuning regulator (STR) that uses the local generator speed to produce appropriate control signals for compensating parametric uncertainty. The parameters of the STR are adjusted online for quality improvement of the power supply under turbulent wind. Simulation results show the proposed controller causes the closed-loop wind turbine to behave as a simple first order power filter, where power output is a low-pass filtered version of the incident wind power. Further, the control scheme achieves the regulation of torsional dynamics without involving converter controls.

AB The paper presents the dynamic model and control schemes of a variable speed pitch wind turbine with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The model includes a PMSG model, a pitch-angled controlled wind turbine model and a drive train model. The drive train model uses one-mass model to represent the mechanical characteristics of the generator set. The generator model is established in the dq-synchronous rotating reference frame. The wind turbine model details the mechanism of variable speed operation of the turbine by a pitch control. The control schemes in the paper include a pitch angle control for the wind turbine and a speed control for the generator. The pitch angle control uses wind speeds and electric power output as the input signals to ensure normal operation in high wind speed. The speed control is realized through field orientation where the d-axis current is set to zero and the q-ams current is used to control the rotational speed of the generator according to the variation of wind speed. In order to verify the presented model and the control strategy, simulations with MATLAB/Simulink software have been conducted. Simulation results prove the validity of the model and the control schemes.

ID AVAILABLE TRANSFER CAPABILITY
AB In last years, electric utilities have been faced by restructuring in power system to open access to transmission network. The need to inspect of possibility of any transaction or schedule of future transfer has motivated an adequate index entitled Available Transfer Capability (ATC). By using Total Transfer Capability (TTC) and considering Existing Transfer Commitment (ETC), the potential for next transaction activities is obtained. On the other hand, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have been taken into account for electric energy generation. Especially Wind Turbines (WTs) is used more than the other kind of RES because of possibility of wide energy production and connection of WTs to transmission networks. The wind has variable nature so generated power with WTs are intermittent too. Presence of WTs in power system can have important effects on TTC that depend on increasing of penetration level of WTs. In this paper a simplified method for modeling of effects of WTs on TTC is presented. A probabilistic multi-level model is considered for wind speed and based on it a model for power output of WTs is developed. The advantages of the proposed method are showed by an application to IEEE 24 bus test system.

AB This paper describes the development of electromechanical and time-domain models for a wind generator. The models may be modified in a straightforward manner to simulate the behavior of a wide range of wind generators operating in different conditions. The electromechanical and time-domain models are used for cross validation. Both squirrel-cage and wound-rotor induction generators are modeled. Direct-connect operation and islanded operation (including disconnection from the grid and self-excited operation) are also modeled. Analyses for fixed-speed and partial variable-speed operation are presented. The main purpose of this endeavor is the development of a system that is able to model commercially available turbines accurately. Schemes to maximize efficiency of a wind generator may be tested on the model and their effectiveness evaluated before they are implemented.

AB In this paper, a novel direct torque control of doubly-fed wound rotor induction machines is proposed and applied to variable speed wind power generation systems. The proposed control strategy was developed based on the control of the rotor power factor. By keeping the rotor power factor equal to one, a switching-table-based hysteresis direct torque control system was built and the corresponding rotor voltage vector table was obtained. The validity of the proposed method was examined using the simulation of the variable speed winding power generation. Promising results were obtained and attractive advantages of the proposed control idea were illustrated including simple structure of the control system, low capacity of the inverter, reduced harmonic pollution to the power grids as well as the other advantages.

AB This paper proposes a modeling and controller design approach for a hybrid wind power generation system that considers a fixed wind-turbine and a dump load. Since operating conditions are kept changing, it is challenge to design a control for reliable operation of the overall system. To consider variable operating conditions, Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model is taken into account to represent time-varying system by expressing the local dynamics of a nonlinear system through sub-systems, partitioned by linguistic rules. Also, each fuzzy model has uncertainty. Thus, in this paper, a modern nonlinear control design technique, the sliding mode nonlinear control design, is utilized for robust control mechanism. In the simulation study, the proposed controller is compared with a proportional-integra (PI) controller. Simulation results show that the proposed controller is more effective against disturbances caused by wind speed and load variation than the PI controller, and thus it contributes to a better quality wind-hybrid power generation system.

AB Wind energy is a significant and powerful resource. It is safe, clean, and abundant Variable speed power generation for a wind turbine is attractive, because maximum efficiency can be achieved at all wind velocities. However, this system requires parameters of wind turbine for calculation of the optimum wind turbine operation speed.
   In this paper, a technique is proposed for maximum power point tracking control of a wind generation system. The optimum operation speed to which the maximization of the output power of the wind turbine is determined takes into consideration identification of parameters by an iterative least squares technique. The effectiveness of maximum power point tracking control with the identified parameters is verified by simulations for the wind power generation system. Additionally, the paper addresses the effect on the rotational speed and output power in the event that the wind turbine parameters used in optimum rotational speed determination have error.

AB The recent trend of wind power generation is to use variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driving a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), or permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). Among them stability analyses of DFIG type of VSWT have already been reported in many literatures. But transient stability analysis for synchronous generator type of VSWT is not sufficient enough. This paper focuses on the transient stability analyses of variable speed wind turbine driving a PMSG (VSWT-PMSG), where the stability during symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults is analyzed.

AB This paper proposed a nonlinear control algorithm for a variable-speed wind turbine without wind speed measurement. The measured permanent magnet generator output current, terminal voltage and shaft speed are used to estimate the electromagnetic torque of the permanent magnet generator by using Kalman filter. Then the wind speed is estimated by Newton-Raphson method after obtaining the estimated power of the wind turbine. The wind turbine is controlled through the adjustment of the electromagnetic torque of the permanent magnet generator for maximum power point tracking below the rated speed. The nonlinear controller for variable-speed wind turbine with the wind speed estimator has good dynamic performance and high power capture efficiency.

DE maximum power point tracking; permanent magnet reluctance generator;
   wind energy conversion system; DC grid; perturb & observe hill climb
   searching
AB This research paper aims to employ a new permanent magnet reluctance generator in a variable speed wind energy conversion system (WECS) of a grid-tied distributed generation application. The grid integration of WECS is achieved through cascaded dc-dc converters ensuring maximum power extraction from the wind energy while maintaining a constant output voltage at the grid side. The surplus power is stored in a capacitor bank that is located in between the cascaded converters. The implemented maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is a hill climb searching (HCS) algorithm that does not require the knowledge of turbine or generator characteristics. However this paper proposes a simple modification in the conventional perturb and observe (P&O) type HCS control and that is to use a 2-valued perturbation step instead of the constant one. A larger perturbation step is used when the operating point is away from the optimal and therefore a faster convergence to the MPP is achieved. On the other hand a small perturbation step is adopted at the end of convergence in order to have the minimum possible oscillations about MPP. A Simplorer-Simulink interface is developed to simulate and verify the proposed control scheme. The results confirm the maximum power trackability and robust voltage regulation of the control system under varying wind conditions and load disturbances.

AB The brushless doubly-fed reluctance machine (BDFRM) has been considered by academic and industrial communities as a potential alternative to conventional doubly-excited wound rotor induction machines (DEWRIW) in variable speed applications with limited speed ranges such as large pumps and wind turbines. While offering similar cost benefits, afforded by the use of partially-rated power electronics, the BDFRM has the following important advantages over DEWRIM - brushless design and consequent maintenance-free operation. The main purpose of this paper is to further improve the reliability and cost-effectiveness of the BDFRM drive by proposing a new observer based algorithm for speed and direct torque (and flux) control (DTC) of this machine without a shaft position sensor using a maximum power factor control strategy as a case study. The developed sensorless control scheme has been experimentally verified on a small BDFRM prototype, and obtained test results have shown that it can perform very well down to zero applied frequency to the inverter-fed winding this being difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional DTC concepts.

AB In the early development of the wind energy, the majority of the wind turbines have been operated at constant speed. Subsequently, the number of variable-speed wind turbines installed in wind farms has increased. In this paper, a comparative study of fixed and variable speed wind turbines incorporating squirrel cage induction generator take into consideration all realistic constraints has been presented. These two systems are modeled and simulated using Matlab. The variable speed induction generator system has been modeled using power electronic converters and vector control technology combined with peak power extraction technique (PPET) enabling the system to run at the most optimal speed. The results are presented for 55kW induction generator, and variable speed operation is highlighted as preferred mode of operation.

AB This paper describes a nonlinear control law for controlling variable speed wind turbines using feedback linearization. The novel aspect of the control law is its ability to decouple the effect of wind fluctuations. Furthermore, the transformation to feedback linearizable coordinates is chosen intelligently so that the majority of the system structure is invariant under the transformation. Consequently the physical interpretation is preserved. The method assumes that the effective wind speed and acceleration are estimated from measurements on the wind turbine. The performance of the control is compared to that of a LQG controller using a specific wind turbine and wind model.

AB This paper presents a new wind speed estimation method for a variable speed wind turbine system, where the theory of SVR(support vector regression) is applied. The turbine speed is controlled to capture the maximum power according to the optimal tip-speed ratio. The inputs of SVR estimator are the wind turbine power and the rotational speed. By off-line training, a specified function which relates the input with the output is obtained. Then, the wind speed is determined from this predicted off-line function and the instantaneous input. The simulation and experimental results have shown that the wind speed is estimated rapidly and accurately.
