AB The direct-drive hydraulic pump suffers the disadvantages of large displacement and difficulty of manufacture. This paper thus proposes a hybrid power transmission technology that utilizes a single-stage gear transmission and low-speed hydraulic pump. The transmission technology reduces the displacement of the hydraulic pump and retains the torque-stable feature of a hydrostatic transmission. This paper designs the basic structure of a hybrid power transmission system and constructs the system model using the AMESim and MATLAB software. Under the grid-connected circumstance, the variable-speed constant-frequency control algorithm when the wind speed is below the rated value and the pitch control algorithm when the wind speed is above the rated value are simulated and analyzed. A 20-kW prototype has been developed. The simulation and the experimental data demonstrate that a hybrid power transmission meets the demands in various working conditions and stabilizes the torque of a wind turbine generation system.

AB Variable-speed wind turbines are increasingly penetrating into the electrical grid, replacing the conventional synchronous-generator-based power plants and thus decreasing the available inertial response for primary frequency stability. This paper offers a deeper understanding of variable-speed wind turbine generators (WTGs) in the context of maximum power point tracking and obtaining primary frequency response. Linearized models have been obtained between the wind velocity and the system frequency versus the power output. System complexity has been studied from the point of view of modal analysis of a two-mass drive train model of a WTG, as well as Hankel singular values. Finally, individual WTG models have been combined to form wind farms, whose complexity has again been found to depend on the nature of modeling of the WTG drive trains.

AB In this paper, an advanced pitch angle control strategy based on the fuzzy logic is proposed for the variable-speed wind turbine systems, in which the generator output power and speed are used as control input variables for the fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The pitch angle reference is produced by the FLC, which can compensate for the nonlinear characteristic of the pitch angle to the wind speed. With the control variables of the generator output power and speed, the wind turbine is smoothly controlled to maintain the aerodynamic power and its speed at the rated values without any fluctuation in the output power and speed in the high-wind-speed regions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results for a 2-MW permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbine system, and experimental results for a reduced-scale PMSG wind turbine simulator.

The BDFRG has been receiving increasing attention because of the use of partially rated power electronics and the high reliability of brushless design, while offering performance competitive to its popular slipring counterpart, the doubly-fed induction generator. The development and viability of the two parameter-independent controllers have been validated on a custom-made BDFRG prototype using the maximum torque per inverter ampere strategy for the speed and loading conditions commonly encountered in wind power applications.

AB In this work, an AC-DC-AC direct-drive power converter was implemented for a wind electric pumping system consisting of a permanent magnet generator (PMG) of 1.3 kW and a peripheral single phase pump of 0.74 kW. In addition, the inverter linear V/f control scheme and the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm with variable V/f were developed. MPPT algorithm seeks to extract water in a wide range of power input using the maximum amount of wind power available. Experimental trials at different pump pressures were conducted. With a MPPT tracking system with variable V/f, a power value of 1.3 kW was obtained at a speed of 350 rpm and a maxiinum operating hydraulic head of 50 m. At lower operating heads pressures (between 10 and 40 m), variable V/f control increases the power generated by the PMG compared to the linear V/f control. This increase ranged between 4% and 23% depending on the operating pressure, with an average of 13%, getting close to the maximum electrical power curve of the PMG. The pump was driven at variable frequency reaching a minimum speed of 0.5 times the rated speed. Efficiency of the power converter ranges between 70% and 95% with a power factor between 0.4 and 0.85, depending on the operating pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The offshore wind system model comprises a variable-speed wind turbine supported on a floating platform, equipped with a permanent magnet synchronous generator using full-power four-level neutral point clamped converter. The link from the offshore floating platform to the onshore electrical grid is done through a light high voltage direct current submarine cable. The drive train is modeled by a three-mass model. Considerations about the smart grid context are offered for the use of the model in such a context. The rectifier voltage malfunction domino effect is presented as a case study to show capabilities of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACO(R)) based integer programming is employed for size optimization in a hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-wind energy system. ACO(R) is a direct extension of ant colony optimization (ACO). Also, it is the significant ant-based algorithm for continuous optimization. In this setting, the variables are first considered as real then rounded in each step of iteration. The number of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries are selected as decision variables of integer programming problem. The objective function of the PV-wind system design is the total design cost which is the sum of total capital cost and total maintenance cost that should be minimized. The optimization is separately performed for three renewable energy systems including hybrid systems, solar stand alone and wind stand alone. A complete data set, a regular optimization formulation and ACOR based integer programming are the main features of this paper. The optimization results showed that this method gives the best results just in few seconds. Also, the results are compared with other artificial intelligent (AI) approaches and a conventional optimization method. Moreover, the results are very promising and prove that the authors' proposed approach outperforms them in terms of reaching an optimal solution and speed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider the operation of a wind turbine and a connected local battery or other electrical storage device, taking into account varying wind speed, with the goal of maximizing the total energy generated while respecting limits on the time derivative (gradient) of power delivered to the grid. We use the turbine inertia as an additional energy storage device, by varying its speed over time, and coordinate the flows of energy to achieve the goal. The control variables are turbine pitch, generator torque and charge/discharge rates for the storage device, each of which can be varied over given ranges. The system dynamics are quite non-linear, and the constraints and objectives are not convex functions of the control inputs, so the resulting optimal control problem is difficult to solve globally. In this paper, we show that by a novel change of variables, which focuses on power flows, we can transform the problem to one with linear dynamics and convex constraints. Thus, the problem can be globally solved, using robust, fast solvers tailored for embedded control applications. We implement the optimal control problem in a receding horizon manner and provide extensive closed-loop tests with real wind data and modern wind forecasting methods. The simulation results using real wind data demonstrate the ability to reject the disturbances from fast changes in wind speed, ensuring certain power gradients, with an insignificant loss in energy production.

AB Gearbox transmission system is the major part of the wind turbine drive train. Due to the manufacturing and assembling errors, lubrication condition, wear and uncertainties in material and geometric properties, the system parameters, including mesh stiffness, transmission error and damping of the meshing gears are always uncertain. For a more reasonable evaluation of dynamic characteristics of the gearbox transmission system, the influence of the uncertain parameters should be taken into consideration. Based on the Chebyshev interval method (CIM), the dynamic responses of a geared transmission system with uncertain parameters are thus investigated in this paper. A torsional vibration model is derived for a geared system, in which some parameters including the mesh stiffness, the transmission error, the mesh damping, the shaft damping, the moment of inertia of the input blades and the torsional stiffness of the driving coupling shaft are considered as uncertain but bounded parameters. Interval dynamic equations of the geared system are solved by use of the CIM in combination with the variable-step Runge-Kutta numerical integration method. The accuracy of the CIM is demonstrated in comparison with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Variations of the upper and lower bounds of the dynamic mesh force with input speed are obtained. The effects of those uncertain parameters on the frequency response of the dynamic mesh force are discussed in detail. It is shown that small parameter uncertainties might be propagated in the vibration system and lead to relatively large uncertainties of the dynamic response of system. The result is of significance for the design and condition monitoring of wind turbine drive trains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of a constant speed wind turbine in an electrical network during torque impact can lead to various problems. The disturbances affect active power quality, reactive power and r.m.s. phase to phase voltage. In this paper, we propose an original system and control to solve firstly the problems due to the variation of DC-voltage source and secondly the brutal impact of active and reactive powers. The principle of the proposed wind energy system with STATCOM supercapacitor energy storage is to limit the rapid variation of active power and give the required reactive power compensation to the induction machine during the torque change. The supercapacitor is directly coupled to the common DC-link of the whole bidirectional DC-AC converter. The control strategy of the STATCOM uses a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) approach to regulate the currents injected or absorbed by the inverter. The same strategy is used to control the variable DC supercapacitor voltage. The simulation results of the STATCOM using a state-feedback with integral controller for i(d), i(q) currents of the converter and a simple proportional (K-p) controller cascaded to d axis current loop for DC voltage source are presented and discussed. Finally, implementation in real time is performed and the first experimental results are presented to validate the proposed control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the electro-thermal analysis of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) in a wind turbine (WT) with gear transmission configuration. The study of the thermal mechanism plays an important role in the development of cost-effective fault diagnostic techniques, design for reliability and premature failure prevention. Starting from an analysis of the DFIG system control and its power losses mechanism, a model that synthesizes the thermal mechanism of the DFIG and a WT system principle is developed to study the thermodynamics of generator stator winding. The transient-state and steady-state temperature characteristics of stator winding under constant and step-cycle patterns of wind speed are studied to show an intrinsic thermal process within a variable-speed WT generator. Thermal behaviors of two failure modes, i.e., generator ventilation system failure and generator stator winding under electric voltage unbalance, are examined in details and validated by both simulation and data analysis. The effective approach presented in this paper for generator fault diagnosis using the acquired SCADA data shows the importance of simulation models in providing guidance for post-data analysis and interpretation. WT generator winding lifetime is finally estimated based on a thermal ageing model to investigate the impacts of wind speed and failure mode.

AB This paper develops a fault diagnosis (FD) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) of pitch actuators in wind turbines. This is accomplished by combining a disturbance compensator with a controller, both of which are formulated in the discrete time domain. The disturbance compensator has a dual purpose: to estimate the actuator fault (which is used by the FD algorithm) and to design the discrete time controller to obtain an FTC. That is, the pitch actuator faults are estimated, and then, the pitch control laws are appropriately modified to achieve an FTC with a comparable behavior to the fault-free case. The performance of the FD and FTC schemes is tested in simulations with the aero-elastic code FAST.

AB Maximum power tracking and copper loss minimisation of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) can be achieved through the control of rotor currents. In this study, a sliding mode regulator (SMR) is presented to regulate the rotor current of a DFIG. The purpose of the SMR is to regulate the rotor current to the target commands of maximum power tracking and copper loss minimisation with stator flux orientation. The robustness to parameter variations can be accomplished by the proposed SMR when the wind turbine is subject to changing wind speed. Simulation results of the DFIG system on a 2.5 MW generator are provided and compared with a fixed-gain proportional-integral (PI) regulator. It is observed from the simulation results that the dynamic responses achieved by the proposed SMR are more robust than those by the fixed-gain PI regulator. The chattering effect caused by the switching function of the SMR can be reduced by an integral type SMR.

AB This study proposes an optimal control method for variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs) based wind farm (WF) to support temporary primary frequency control. This control method consists of two layers: temporary frequency support control (TFSC) of the VSWT, and temporary support power optimal dispatch (TSPOD) of the WF. With TFSC, the VSWT could temporarily provide extra power to support system frequency under varying and wide-range wind speed. In the WF control centre, TSPOD optimally dispatches the frequency support power orders to the VSWTs that operate under different wind speeds, minimises the wind energy cost of frequency support, and satisfies the support capabilities of the VSWTs. The effectiveness of the whole control method is verified in the IEEE-RTS built in MATLAB\Simulink, and compared with a published de-loading method.

AB Almost the entire global population of the Franklin's Gull performs a great spring migration from wintering areas in South America to breeding areas in North America. During this journey, the birds must pass through Tehuantepec Isthmus (in Mexico), where consistent wind regimes have led to the establishment of economically important wind farm facilities. These artificial structures present a major collision risk to birds flying at low altitudes (i.e. of <80 m, which is the maximum height of a wind turbine). Franklin Gull flight paths are erratic, something thought to be related to certain environmental variables. Identifying the factors that influence the height at which this species flies, in addition to determining the peak timing of migration, might provide wind farm operators with simple ways to reduce the risk of collision. Here, we extensively monitored the migratory behavior of this species near a wind farm in the Tehuantepec Isthmus during the spring of 2008, 2009, and 2011. Specifically we recorded bird numbers, the height at which birds flew, and environmental variables. We then performed Flexible Discriminant Analysis to identify the variables that most accurately explained the variation of flight heights. Wind direction was the most important variable that explained whether birds flew at higher or lower altitudes, with birds flying at lower altitudes against headwinds from the north, because of the effect of wind shear. The total number of migratory birds differed among years (8000-66,000), suggesting the necessity of long-term monitoring to assess potential impacts. A total of 34,619 individuals were recorded flying <80 m - where collision is likely - however, the proportion of birds flying in this risk height was variable among years, ranging from 35 to 71%. The peak number of individuals consistently passed between late April and early May. Therefore, wind farm managers should implement vigilance programs that are primarily focused during the peak migration period and on days with north winds to reduce the risk of this gull species colliding with wind turbine machinery.

AB This paper proposes a new direct power control (DPC) strategy of double-fed induction generator using fuzzy logic controller. The active and reactive power equations are expanded, and effects of voltage vectors on active and reactive power variations are investigated quantitatively. The selection of the voltage vectors is performed using fuzzy system which is used instead of optimal switching table. Four variables are used as inputs of the fuzzy system which are errors of active and reactive powers, real time value of the rotor speed and stator flux position. The defuzzified output is the optimal selected voltage vector. MATLAB/Simulink software is used for the purpose of simulation and the results reported show the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the waveform quality. Compared with the conventional DPC, the proposed fuzzy technique can reduce the power out of band percentage by about 25 % which is very impressive.

AB Wind speed variation presents the main problem for electricity production in wind power industry. Although wind is all around us, it is impossible to control its stochastic nature. As a result, existing wind turbines produce electricity with variable frequency, which demands synchronization with electric net. Synchronization process implies frequency conversion, which generates significant power losses in the system. Present researches mainly focus on reduction of power losses and efficiency increase of WT's through speed control and maintain of electric generator speed at the, same level. In this work as a backbone of wind power plants innovation, authors present a new design of WT gear train with variable transmission ratio according to wind speed variation, providing direct synchronization to electric net - a hybrid gearbox that consists of mechanical, electro-electronic and software system. Mechanical system contains one specific planetary gearbox, with total transmission ratio i=1/25 and one planetary gear set for continual variation of overall transmission ratio. Electro-electronic system consists of motor-generator for transmission ratio variation and of electronic components for closed loop speed control. Software system provides control system variation and variation of components characteristics based on process identification and predictive control model decision. Concepts of software and control systems are presented and discussed in this work. For each of these systems, testing methodology is developed, with proposal of new closed power loop test rig design. The new design of testing rig provides testing of load capacity of complete WT drivetrain and verification of the system operation quality.

AB The key control problems associated with variable speed wind turbines are maximization of extracted energy when operating below the rated wind speed, and power and speed regulation when operating above the rated wind speed. In this paper, we develop a nonlinear systems framework to address these problems. The framework is used to visualize and analyze the equilibria of the wind turbine as its operating regimes and controllers change. For both below rated and above rated wind speeds, we adopt nonlinear controllers, analyze the stability property of the resulting equilibria, and establish the criterion for switching between control regimes. Further, the regions of attraction of the resulting equilibria are determined, and the existence of a common region of attraction, which allows stable switching between operating regimes, is shown. The control input maintains continuity at the point of switching. We next provide a method for blade pitch modulation to control rotor speed at high wind speeds. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we prove stability of the equilibria in the presence of the two independently functioning torque-and pitch-control feedback loops. Simulation results are presented and the controller is compared with existing works from the literature.

AB This paper investigates an improved active power control method for variable speed wind turbine to enhance the inertial response and damping capability during transient events. The optimized power point tracking (OPPT) controller, which shifts the turbine operating point from the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curve to the virtual inertia control (VIC) curves according to the frequency deviation, is proposed to release the "hidden" kinetic energy and provide dynamic frequency support to the grid. The effects of the VIC on power oscillation damping capability are theoretically evaluated. Compared to the conventional supplementary derivative regulator-based inertia control, the proposed control scheme can not only provide fast inertial response, but also increase the system damping capability during transient events. Thus, inertial response and power oscillation damping function can be obtained in a single controller by the proposed OPPT control. A prototype three-machine system containing two synchronous generators and a PMSG-based wind turbine with 31% of wind penetration is tested to validate the proposed control strategy on providing rapid inertial response and enhanced system damping.

AB In this contribution, a bond graph doubly-fed wind turbine generator control is proposed. The control law is derived from the inverse model of the doubly-fed induction generator, which allows a different structure for the torque control to be obtained. The bond graph methodology and the concept of bicausality are applied to derive the control law. The robustness of the proposed control is verified and the simulation of the complete model is conducted for constant and variable wind speed operation conditions, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

AB Ocean currents represent an alternative source of clean energy given their inherent reliability, persistence and sustainability. The general ocean circulation is characterized by large rotating ocean gyres resulting in rapid ocean currents along the western boundaries because of the Coriolis Effect. The Gulf Stream system is formed by the western boundary current of the North Atlantic Ocean flowing along the east coast of the United States, and is of particular interest as a potential energy resource for the United States. This study presents a national database of ocean current kinetic energy resource derived from seven years of numerical model simulations to help advance awareness and market penetration for ocean current energy. A web based GIS interface is provided for dissemination of the national energy resource data: http://www.oceancurrentpower.gatech.edu/. The website includes GIS layers of computed monthly and yearly mean ocean current speed and associated power density along the coastlines of the United States, as well as joint and marginal probability histograms for current velocities at a variable horizontal resolution of 4-7 km. Various tools are provided for viewing, identifying, filtering and downloading the data from this website. The Gulf Stream system, especially the Florida Current, concentrates the highest kinetic power density (> 2000 W/m(2)). The majority of the kinetic power and its variability are only present in relatively shallow water given the strong correlation with the surface wind stress. The kinetic energy flux in the Florida Current is estimated over 30 years to provide temporal variability of the undisturbed kinetic energy with high statistical significance. Available power of approximately 5 GW associated with the undisturbed natural flow condition from the Gulf Stream system is predicted based on hypothetical turbine parameters. Successful development of renewable energy generation requires further studies to account for more precise technical, economic and environmental constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The hierarchical control structure of a microgrid can be described as having four levels responsible for processing, sensing and adjusting, monitoring and supervising, and maintenance and optimization. The responsibility of the hierarchical control level is to provide control over the production of power from renewable sources. This paper comprehensively investigates the principles of hierarchical control in microgrids from a technical point of view. In the first step, this article covers the control of the power generation using two popular renewable energy sources, namely wind turbines and photovoltaics. The synchronization and power flow between the microgrid and the main network is then investigated. Finally, some research questions are presented to improve the performance of the hierarchical control, especially in the secondary decentralized control and energy storage systems.

AB Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ ecological niche' principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

AB This paper proposes a multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA) program for wind turbine layout optimization in a wind farm which aims at extracting the maximum power in a minimum investment cost. The MPGA program is applied to a 2 km x 2 km wind farm considering three different wind scenarios, i.e. (a): constant wind speed of 12 m/s with fixed wind direction; (b): constant wind speed of 12 m/s with variable wind direction and (c): variable wind speed of 8 m/s, 12 m/s, 17 m/s with variable wind directions. Compared with previous studies, the results of power generation cost of energy and wind farm efficiency are improved in the paper using MPGA which validate that MPGA works effectively in wind turbine layout optimization with wind farm. Additionally, a case study of wind turbine layout configuration op1timization using the MPGA program in a hypothetical offshore wind farm located in Hong Kong southeastern water is attempted using the 20 years' wind data from 1992 to 2011. The optimization result is beneficial for the assessment of the offshore wind power potential in Hong Kong. It is indicated that, under the optimization of wind turbines layout in the wind farm, 39.14 x 10(8) kWh/year electricity can be converted from the offshore wind farm, which occupies 9.09% of the 2012 electricity consumption in Hong Kong. Results show that the multi-population genetic algorithm program can be applied in any real-world wind farms for wind turbine layout optimization when the wind farm boundary is determined as well as the local wind condition is obtained.

AB A combined experimental and numerical investigation is carried out to study the performance of a micro vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) with variable-pitch. Three-dimensional numerical simulations are essentially employed, for the VAWT involves a low aspect ratio (AR) three straight blades with struts. The performance of the VAWT is experimentally measured using a wind tunnel, while large eddy simulation (LES) with dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale (SGS) model is employed to help understand the associated flow structure. The effects of wind speed, turbulence intensity, airfoil shape, and strut mechanism with and without variable-pitch on the performance of the turbine are carefully assessed, both experimentally and numerically. The accuracy of the SGS model in predicting the laminar-turbulent transition is also examined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper a probabilistic economic dispatch model considering thermal units (fuel generators), photovoltaic arrays and wind energy conversion systems is proposed. Wind speed, solar radiation and power demand are recognized as random variables. Unavailability of each type of power source is also considered. The solution strategy is based on the Monte Carlo method and non-linear constrained optimization. The optimal solution involves single and multidimensional probabilities, descriptive statistics, cluster and bimodal analysis. The proposed methodology yields the probability distributions of system marginal price, thermal (fuel based), solar and wind power generation and load shedding. The proposed model and methodology are applied to a case study of the Northern Chilean electrical system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with a hierarchical structure composed by an event-based supervisor in a higher level and two distinct proportional integral (PI) controllers in a lower level. The controllers are applied to a variable speed wind energy conversion system with doubly-fed induction generator, namely, the fuzzy PI control and the fractional-order PI control. The event-based supervisor analyses the operation state of the wind energy conversion system among four possible operational states: park, start-up, generating or brake and sends the operation state to the controllers in the lower level. In start-up state, the controllers only act on electric torque while pitch angle is equal to zero. In generating state, the controllers must act on the pitch angle of the blades in order to maintain the electric power around the nominal value, thus ensuring that the safety conditions required for integration in the electric grid are met. Comparisons between fuzzy PI and fractional-order PI pitch controllers applied to a wind turbine benchmark model are given and simulation results by Matlab/Simulink are shown. From the results regarding the closed loop point of view, fuzzy PI controller allows a smoother response at the expense of larger number of variations of the pitch angle, implying frequent switches between operational states. On the other hand fractional-order PI controller allows an oscillatory response with less control effort, reducing switches between operational states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the important features of low-carbon electric power system is the massive deployment of renewable energy resources in the advent of a new carbon-strained economy. Wind generation is a major technology of generating electric power with zero carbon dioxide emission. In a power system with the high penetration of wind generation, the displacement of conventional synchronous generators with variable speed wind turbines reduces system inertia. This leads to larger system frequency deviation following a loss of large generation. In this paper, the impact of the reduction of system inertia on system frequency is analyzed as the result of the integration of a significant amount of wind generation into power systems. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study of the impact of the distribution of the inertia contributions from those online conventional synchronous generators on the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) based on the total energy injected into the system due to the fault. The total fault energy is represented using Hamiltonian formulism. With the IEEE 39-bus system, it is shown that for a fault with the given injected total energy, clearing time, and location, the distribution of inertia contributions can significantly affect the magnitude of ROCOF. Moreover, for such a fault with different locations, the average of the magnitudes of ROCOF caused by the fault at different locations is larger when the distribution of the inertia contributions is more dispersed.

AB Research into fault diagnosis in machines with a wide range of variable loads and speeds, such as wind turbines, is of great industrial interest. Analysis of the power signals emitted by wind turbines for the diagnosis of mechanical faults in their mechanical transmission chain is insufficient. A successful diagnosis requires the inclusion of accelerometers to evaluate vibrations. This work presents a multi-sensory system for fault diagnosis in wind turbines, combined with a data-mining solution for the classification of the operational state of the turbine. The selected sensors are accelerometers, in which vibration signals are processed using angular resampling techniques and electrical, torque and speed measurements. Support vector machines (SVMs) are selected for the classification task, including two traditional and two promising new kernels. This multi-sensory system has been validated on a test-bed that simulates the real conditions of wind turbines with two fault typologies: misalignment and imbalance. Comparison of SVM performance with the results of artificial neural networks (ANNs) shows that linear kernel SVM outperforms other kernels and ANNs in terms of accuracy, training and tuning times. The suitability and superior performance of linear SVM is also experimentally analyzed, to conclude that this data acquisition technique generates linearly separable datasets.

AB The basic idea of the fractional frequency transmission system (FFTS) is to use lower frequency to reduce the effective electrical length of the ac transmission line, thus increasing its transmission capacity. Because the rotational speeds of the generators in hydro and wind power generation systems are very low, the FFTS is particularly suitable for transmitting electricity produced by renewable energy sources. The fractional frequency wind power system (FFWPS) provides an effective approach for integrating the large-scale and long-distance wind power into the grid. A novel method of the integration of the wind turbines in direct-driven FFWPS is introduced in this paper. A full-power ac-dc-ac converter is used as the grid-connection device in the experiment, and the experiment results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, the performance of a novel two-loop control strategy for a three-phase self-excited induction generator (SEIG), used in wind/microhydro/biogas-based isolated generation schemes, is presented. The implementation of the grid-interactive synchronization of the generalized impedance controller (GIC), an impedance-controlled operation of pulse width modulation (PWM) voltage-source converter, with SEIG is described. The SEIG frequency is tracked using digital phase-locked loop implemented on a dSpace DSP platform. The open-loop SEIG-GIC system is experimentally analyzed for the sensitivity of the SEIG voltage and frequency to GIC modulation index m and phase angle delta. Based on this, a simple and practical control strategy with proportional-integral (PI)-based voltage and frequency feedback loops is evolved for the regulation of the SEIG voltage and frequency. A novel design procedure for both the PI controllers for stable closed-loop operation is presented. The performance of the proposed closed-loop system is experimentally tested under speed and load perturbations.

AB Due to the high efficiency and compact mechanical structure, direct drive variable speed generators are used for power conversion in wind turbines. The wind energy conversion system (WECS) considered in this paper consists of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), uncontrolled rectifier, dc-dc boost converter controlled with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and adaptive hysteresis controlled voltage source inverter (VSI). For high utilization of the converter's power capability and stabilizing voltage and power flow, constant DC-link voltage is essential. Step and search MPPT algorithm which senses the rectified voltage (V-DC) alone and controls the same is used to effectively maximize the output power. The adaptive hysteresis band current control is characterized by fast dynamic response and constant switching frequency. With MPPT and adaptive hysteresis band current control in VSI, the DC link voltage is maintained constant under variable wind speeds and transient grid currents respectively.

AB This paper presents a new implementation of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type fuzzy controller (PIDfc) for a battery grid-supporting inverter to regulate the frequency and voltage of an autonomous distributed variable-speed wind turbine (VSWT). The VSWT which drives a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is assumed for demonstration. The PIDfc is built from a set of control rules that adopts the droop control method and uses only locally measurable frequency and voltage signals. The output control signals are determined from the knowledge base and the fuzzy inference. To ensure safe battery operating limits, we also propose a protection scheme called intelligent battery protection (IBP). Several simulation experiments are performed by using MATLAB/SimPowerSystems. Next, to verify the scheme's effectiveness, the simulation results are compared with the results of a conventional controller through some performance indices. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PIDfc scheme to control a grid-supporting inverter of battery in the reduction of frequency and voltage fluctuations.

AB Online fault detection is an effective means to improve wind turbine reliability and performance and reduce wind turbine downtime and operating and maintenance costs. Current-based wind turbine fault detection techniques have received more and more attention in academia and industry due to their nonintrusive character and economic advantages. This paper presents a novel computationally efficient high-resolution wideband synchronous sampling algorithm for the mechanical fault detection of variable-speed direct-drive wind turbines (i.e., no gearbox) only using nonstationary generator stator current measurements. The proposed algorithm synchronously re-samples the current signals such that the varying characteristic frequencies of the excitations generated by wind turbine faults in the current signals become constant values. An impulse detection algorithm is then proposed to detect the faults by identifying the excitations from the frequency spectra of the synchronously sampled stator current signals. Experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the detection of rotor eccentricity and bearing faults of a direct-drive wind turbine operating in variable-speed conditions.

AB Wind velocity assumes a critical part for measuring the power created by the wind turbines. Nonetheless, power production from wind has a few weaknesses. One significant issue is that wind is a discontinuous energy source which implies that there exists substantial variability in the generation of vigor because of different variables, for example, wind speed. Wind direction is a significant variable for proficient turbine control for getting the most energy with a given wind speed. Taking into account the conjectures on wind heading, it might be conceivable to adjust the turbine to the wind bearing to get the most energy yield. Since both forecasts of wind speed and direction are basic for effective wind energy collecting it is crucial to develop a methodology for estimation of wind speed and direction and afterwards to estimate wind farm power production as function of wind pace and heading distribution. Despite the fact that various numerical functions have been proposed for demonstrating the wind speed and direction frequency distribution, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time. In this investigation adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which is a particular sort of the artificial neural networks (ANN) family, was used to anticipate the wind speed and direction frequency dispersion. Thereafter, the ANFIS system was utilized to gauge wind homestead power creation as function of wind velocity and bearing. Neural system in ANFIS modifies parameters of enrollment capacity in the fuzzy logic of the fuzzy inference system. The reenactment outcomes exhibited in this paper demonstrate the adequacy of the created technique.

AB This paper focuses doubly fed induction generator based variable speed wind turbines to contribute in arresting system frequency decay and provide primary control power upon power imbalances for the provision of an active power reserve. The fuzzy-based control strategy is proposed to improve the primary frequency regulation by wind turbine generator (WTG). Moreover, rotor speed of the deloaded WTG is optimized to extract more rotational kinetic energy from deloaded WTG. Using deloaded operation, WTG can acquire reserve energy which can be used during depressed frequency conditions. In this paper, deloading is adjusted continuously by using fuzzy control so that output power from deloaded WTG increases. The dynamic deloading helps in stabilizing the generator during large load change and increases output power from the deloaded WTG. Hence, proposed fuzzy based dynamic deloading scheme not only increases overall annual capacity factor of wind farm but also reduces the fuel consumption when diesel generators are operated along with wind turbines. In order to get more realistic picture, wake effect of wind turbines is incorporated. In this paper, wind farm integrated stand-alone power system is considered for frequency regulation. The extensive MATLAB simulation results are presented by considering different case studies in support of the theory.

AB This paper presents the results of an investigation into the performance of different controllers in active load control of wind turbine blades equipped with microtabs. A bang bang (BB) controller, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) a proportional integral derivative (PID) and a sliding mode controller (SMC) are synthesised for load alleviation. The performance of the synthesised controllers in load alleviation is evaluated by employing WTAC (Wind Turbine Aeroelastic and Control), a wind turbine simulator incorporating an unsteady aerodynamic module, a structural analysis module and a control module. The variable-speed pitch-controlled NREL-5 MW is adopted as the case study. Using frequency domain analysis it is shown that for the studied case all controllers have more or less the same performance at rejecting the first rotational frequency loads. It is also shown that all controllers are more effective at rejecting loads with lower frequencies. BB and PID controllers, although capable of rejecting low frequency loads, may cause amplification of loads with higher frequencies. Investigating the performance of four controllers at different wind speeds for the studied wind turbine, it is observed that the effectiveness of BB and PID controllers reduces with wind speed but on the other hand SMC and LQR perform better at higher wind speeds. Introducing a new parameter, life index, the performance of different controllers in terms of the actuation wear is investigated. It is shown that LQR cause less actuation wear compared to SMC, while having comparable performance in load alleviation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper proposes an observer based active fault tolerant control (AFTC) approach to a non-linear large rotor wind turbine benchmark model. A sensor fault hiding and actuator fault compensation strategy is adopted in the design. The adapted observer based AFTC system retains the well-accepted industrial controller as the baseline controller, while an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to provide estimates of system states and fault signals within a linear parameter varying (LPV) descriptor system context using linear matrix inequality (LMI). In the design, pole-placement is used as a time-domain performance specification while H-infinity, optimization is used to improve the closed-loop system robustness to exogenous disturbances or modelling uncertainty.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present a model of the load of the wind turbine gears for simulation of real, varying operational conditions for modelling of wind turbine vibration. The characteristics of the wind, which generates chaotically varying loads on the drivetrain components generating load in teeth and bearings of gears during torque transfer, are discussed. A generator of variable load of wind turbines drivetrain is proposed. Firstly, the module for generation of wind speed is designed. It is based on the approach in which the wind speed was considered as a time series approximated by the Weierstrass function. Secondly, the rotational speed of the main shaft is proposed as a function of the wind speed value. The function depends on a few parameters that are fitted by using a genetic algorithm. Finally, the model of torque of the main shaft is introduced. This model has been created by using a multi-layer artificial neural network. The results show that the proposed approach yields a very good fit for the experimental data. The fit brings about the proper reproducing of all the aspects of the load that are crucial for causing fatigue and, as a consequence, damaging of gears of the wind turbines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The continuous progress on the expansion of renewable energies leads to the development of hybrid power systems, where several power sources contribute to provide a clean and reliable alternative to traditional fossil fuels. The hydrogen technology is viewed with particular interest in this regard. Hydrogen is an outstanding energy carrier that can be exploited for various applications, including electricity generation. Hence, production of hydrogen from renewable sources has received the attention of many researchers lately. With this purpose, this paper deals with the coupled operation of electrolyzer (EZ) and wind turbine. Four different EZ models are presented and evaluated in this work. These models are aggregated to a variable speed wind turbine model using MATLAB/Simulink. The four configurations are evaluated, and their responses compared, under variable wind speed and grid demand. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a method to seek the PI controller parameters of a PMSG wind turbine to improve control performance. Since operating conditions vary with the wind speed, therefore the PI controller parameters should be determined as a function of the wind speed. Small-signal modeling of a PMSG WT is implemented to analyze the stability under various operating conditions and with eigenvalues obtained from the small-signal model of the PMSG WT, which are coordinated by adjusting the PI controller parameters. The parameters to be tuned are chosen by investigating participation factors of state variables, which simplifies the problem by reducing the number of parameters to be tuned. The process of adjusting these PI controller parameters is carried out using particle swarm optimization (PSO). To characterize the improvements in the control method due to the PSO method of tuning the PI controller parameters, the PMSG WT is modeled using the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems libraries with the obtained PI controller parameters.

AB Dissection of the power output in a row of working turbines and the reliance on wind course in respect to the column heading is examined. The point is to portray the extent of the wake impacts and give a sign of the indication of wind bearing. The target is to delineate whether the uniting of wakes inside extensive wind homesteads can be depicted by basic direct models or whether the consideration of the two-route collaboration between the wind turbines and the limit layer is a fundamental essential for precise models of wakes to be utilized within future wind farm plan. Soft computing methodologies may be utilized as substitute for analytical approach since they provides some benefits such as no need to information of internal system parameters, compact solution for multi-variable problems. This investigation dealt with application of ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) for predicting the wake power and wind speed deficit. To provide statistical analysis, RMSE (root mean square error), coefficient of determination (R-2) and Pearson coefficient (r) were utilized. The study results suggested that ANFIS would be an efficient soft computing methodology to offer precise predictions of wake wind speed deficit and power deficit ratio in wind farms. According to the achieved results, the best prediction was observed for free wind speed of 8 m/s. The RMSE, R-2 and r were computed as 0.0763, 0.9893 and 0.9946 for ANFIS prediction of wake wind speed deficit and as 0.0128, 0.9967 and 0.9984 for ANFIS prediction of power deficit ratio.

AB This study examines the spatial and temporal variability of wind speed at 80 m above ground (the average hub height of most modern wind turbines) in the contiguous United States using Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data from 1979 to 2011. The mean 80-m wind exhibits strong seasonality and large spatial variability, with higher (lower) wind speeds in the winter (summer), and higher (lower) speeds over much of the Midwest and U.S. Northeast (U.S. West and Southeast). Trends are also variable spatially, with more upward trends in areas of the Great Plains and Intermountain West of the United States and more downward trends elsewhere. The leading EOF mode, which accounts for 20% (summer) to 33% (winter) of the total variance and represents in-phase variations across the United States, responds mainly to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in summer and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENS 0) in the other seasons. The dominant variation pattern can be explained by a southerly/southwesterly (westerly) anomaly over the U.S. East (U.S. West) as a result of the anomalous mean sea level pressure (MSLP) pattern. The second EOF mode, which explains about 15% of the total variance and shows a seesaw pattern, is mainly related to the springtime Arctic Oscillation (AO), the summertime recurrent circumglobal teleconnection (CGT), the autumn Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and the winter El Nino Modoki. The anomalous jet stream and MSLP patterns associated with these indices are responsible for the wind variation.

DE wind energy; wind turbine imbalance; condition monitoring; structural
   dynamics; pitch control; structural health monitoring
AB Wind power is the world's fastest growing renewable energy source, but operations and maintenance costs are still a major obstacle toward reliability and widescale adoption of wind power, accounting for a large part of the cost of energy for offshore installations. Structural health monitoring systems have been proposed for implementing condition-based maintenance. The wind energy industry currently uses condition monitoring systems that are mostly adapted from roating machinery in other power generation industries. However, these systems have had limited effectiveness on wind turbines because of their atypical operating conditions, which are characterized by low and variable rotational speed, rapidly varying torque, extremely large rotors and stochastic loading from the wind. Although existing systems primarily take measurements from the nacelle, valuable information can be extracted from the structural dynamic response of the rotor blades to mitigate potentially damaging loading conditions. One such condition is rotor imbalance, which not only reduces the aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine and therefore its power output but can also lead to very large increases in loading on the drivetrain, blades and tower. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's fast software was used to model both mass and aerodynamic imbalance in a 5MW offshore wind turbine. It is shown that a combination of blade and nacelle measurements, most of which can be obtained from standard instrumentation already found on utility-scale wind turbines, can be formulated into an algorithm used to detect and locate imbalance. The method described herein allows for imbalance detection that is potentially more sensitive than existing on-line systems, while taking advantage of sensors that are already in place on many utility-scale wind turbines.

AB Wind speed correlation and wind turbine generator (WTG) outage are two factors affecting the reliability model of wind farms, but they are not addressed simultaneously in the existing literature. Meanwhile, WTG outage is reported to be dependent with wind speed to some extent. Therefore, the extended reliability models of wind farms incorporating both of these two factors and the dependency between WTG outage and wind speed are proposed in this paper. To consider the uncertainties and dependencies of wind speed and WTG failure, Copula method is applied to simulate correlated random variables representing for wind speed and the number of failed WTG units. Moreover, the linear apportioning technique is used to create multistate reliability models of wind farms from hourly wind power models. A number of sensitivity analyses on the modified IEEE RTS with wind power are conducted to validate the proposed reliability models for generation adequacy assessment. Case studies show that the generation adequacy indices increase with the correlation of wind speed and WTG forced outage rate (FOR). It is meaningful to point out that the effect of dependency between wind speed and WTG FOR on generation adequacy is minimal when WTG outages are independent, but it will be substantially larger when WTG outages are highly dependent. The proposed multistate reliability models of wind farms provide foundation for the reliability assessment of power systems with wind power integrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wind speed as well as the power output of wind turbine generators (WTGs) have high correlations and may not be normally distributed. In this paper, the method of Zhao's point estimate method (PEM) combined with Nataf transformation was applied into correlated probabilistic load flow (PLF) calculation. This method can deal with correlated input random variables (RVs) with normal or non-normal probability distributions. Instead of joint probability density functions (PDFs) of multivariate RVs, this method only requires data of the marginal distribution function of each input RV and their correlation coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the numerical tests on IEEE 14-bus and the IEEE 118-bus systems. Besides, relative average errors compared with correlated Monte Carlo Simulation (CMCS) are analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the variable speed wind turbine based on electromagnetic coupler (WT-EMC), a synchronous generator is directly coupled with grid. So like conventional power plants WT-EMC is able to support grid frequency inherently. But due to the reduced inertia of synchronous generator, its frequency support capability has to be enhanced. In this paper, the frequency support capability of WT-EMC is studied at three typical wind conditions and with two control strategies-droop control and inertial control to enhance its frequency support capability. The synchronous generator speed, more stable than the grid frequency which is the input signal for Type 3 and Type 4 wind turbine frequency support controller, is used for the calculation of WT-EMC supplementary torque command. The integrated simulation environment based on the aeroelastic code HAWC2 and software Matlab/Simulink is used to build a 2 MW WT-EMC model and study the frequency support capability of a wind farm consisting of WT-EMC.

AB In order to maximise the wind energy capture, wind turbines are operated at variable speeds. Depending on the wind speed, a turbine switches between two operating modes: a low wind speed mode and a high wind speed mode. During the low wind speed mode, the control objective is to maximise wind energy capture by controlling both the blade pitch angle and the electrical generator torque. During the high wind speed mode, the control goal is to maintain the rated power generation by only adjusting the blade pitch angle. This paper establishes the stability criteria for the switching operation of wind turbines using
   [GRAPHICS]
   gain under the nonlinear control framework. Also, the performance of the wind turbine system is analysed by using the step response, a well-known measure for second-order linear systems.

AB The evolution of power semiconductors has contributed enormously to variable-speed wind turbine systems (WTS). In this study, a new method for power output calculation of variable-speed WTSs is proposed. The model is developed from the charging voltage equation of capacitors and is only a function of the rated power and the rated wind speed. It is validated on the manufacturer power curve of different type and size of variable-speed WTSs. Additionally, by using developed model, the capacity factor of this type of WTS is also modelled in terms of the rated wind speed and Weibull distribution of the wind site. Parametrical analyses have been carried out to show the effect of rated wind speed on the value of turbine capacity factor, resulting of energy production for different wind conditions (Weibull scale parameter). The feasible value of rated wind speed for located or considered variable-speed WTSs at different stations in Turkey are also analysed and results are given.

AB A clear focus is nowadays on developing and improving the energy storage technologies. Pumped storage is a well-established one, and is capable of enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources. Pumped storage has an efficiency between 70-80%, and each of its elements affects it. Increased efficiency is desired especially when operating with renewable energy systems, which present low energy conversion factor ( up to 50% - performance coefficient for wind turbines, and efficiency up to 40% for photovoltaic systems). In this paper the most efficient operation points of the induction motors in pumped storage systems are established. The variable speed operation of the pumped storage systems and motor loading conditions for pump applications have been the key factors for achieving the purpose of the paper.
