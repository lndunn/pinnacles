AB As Development of small vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) for urban use is becoming an interesting topic both within industry and academia. However, there are few new designs of vertical axis turbines which are customized for building integration. These are getting importance because they operate at low rotational speed producing very less noise during operation, although these are less efficient than Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT). The efficiency of a VAWT has been significantly improved by H-Darrieus VAWT design based on double airfoil technology as demonstrated by the authors in a previous publication. Further, it is well know that the variation of the blade pitch angle during the rotation improves the power efficiency. A blade pitch variation is implemented by active blade pitch control, which operates as per wind speed and position of the blade with respect to the rotor. A double multiple stream tube method is used to determine the performance of the H-Darrieus VAWT. The power coefficient is compared with that of a fixed pitch and a variable pitch double airfoil blade VAWT. It is demonstrated that an improvement in power coefficient by 20% is achieved and the turbine could start at low wind speed.

DE Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator Renewable Wind Energy; Reduced

ID GENERATORS; SYSTEMS
AB Characteristics of a small scale wind turbine using Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator and connected to a grid through a reduced switches count converter (two legs only) are studied in this paper. Active power output corresponding with the input is given with the reactive power produced by the wind turbine regulated at 0 MVAr. Variable wind speed is optimum for drive train performance at 10 m/s (at maximum power coefficient point). When wind speed changes, the turbine moves away from its optimal tip speed ratio until maximum power point tracking forces the turbine to operate at its optimal speed. The generator torque is regulated by controlling the generator current based on the principle of field oriented control where a decoupling between the field and torque current components is achieved. The generator reference voltage and the converter switching signals are synthesized using the principle of space vector modulation. A 5.7 kW grid-connected variable speed wind turbine is simulated using Matlab/Simulink to study the feasibility of the proposed control technique.

The machine that we study is the Double Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The association of this generator to the wind turbine give birth the Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). Looking to the no stability of the wind and it variable speed, this condition makes very variable voltage amplitude. This result impresses a variable excitation system to stabilize voltage amplitude.

AB In order to meet the ever increasing demand of electricity, renewable energy such as Wind Energy can be a viable option in generating a substantial amount of electricity. This paper leads to pick the best possible method between VSCF (Variable Speed Constant Frequency) and CSCF (Constant Speed Constant Frequency) of Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) because of experiencing tremendous growth of this scheme in recent time. Besides, IGBT inverter has the demonstration of so called "short-circuit withstanding capability" which ensures the withstanding of severe condition by preventing large short circuit current. A speed control system which comprises speed controller, actuator model and the turbine linearized model is proposed which can be used to stabilize the frequency through speed control. In addition the implementation of solar cell in WECS has also been proposed which can ensure more effective and relatively stable output power.

AB In this paper, we consider the pitch control of variable speed wind turbines with the aim of maximizing power output. Pitch angle control is a common approach for regulating the aerodynamic torque of the wind turbine when wind speed is above rated speed. The proposed pitch controller includes two paths, a nonlinear feed-forward path and a linear feedback path. The feed-forward path uses the information about the desired power output, wind velocity and the turbine speed to determine the pitch angle required. The gains of the linear controller are tuned to minimize changes in the tip speed ratio, which in turn will lead to optimum power. The results obtained from the implementing the proposed controller to a wind turbine show a good performance and optimum energy capture.

AB The development of many technologies has provided a fast growth in the wind power. In this context, the variable speed wind turbines are preferred because more power is extracted from the wind. The synchronous machines has been gained attention because eliminates the gearbox, source of many mechanical problems. Moreover, the use of full converters improves the performance of the system because the grid disturbances are not transmitted to the machine. In this context, this work compares the three main topologies of wind turbines using synchronous generators. The performance of these models will be compared when voltage sags occur and will be discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each technology.

AB This paper investigates the novel Variable Structure Direct Torque Control (VS-DTC) scheme for Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) based on the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) to maximize the generated power from wind turbine. The system includes a wind turbine, a PMSG, two converters and an intermediate DC link capacitor. The efficiency of the WECS can be greatly improved using an appropriate control strategy. Furthermore, the system has strong nonlinear multivariable with many uncertain factors and disturbances. Accordingly, the control strategy combines the technique of Direct Torque Control (DTC) and Sliding Mode (SM) nonlinear control theory. Considering the variation of wind speed, the grid-side converter injects the generated power into the AC network, regulates DC-link voltage and it's used to achieve unity power factor, whereas the PMSG side converter is used to achieve Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Simulation results, by Matlab/Simulink, have shown the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for WECS based on the PMSG.

AB In this paper, a control for variable speed Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) that incorporates a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) is described. The proposed approach is based on a Vector Control theory (VC) for regulate of both grid-side and machine converters of a PMSG wind turbine. Then, an optimal control strategy is developed for integrated control of PMSG power extraction. It combines Space Vector Modulation (SVM) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control strategy to maximize the generated power from Wind Turbine Generator (WTG). A pitch control scheme for variable speed WTG is proposed to limit the output power produced by the turbine. Therefore, WECS can not only capture the maximum wind energy, however also can maintain the frequency and amplitude of the output voltage with unity power factor. Finally, the effectiveness of the novel control strategy is verified by simulation using Matlab/ Simulink environment. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for WECS based on the PMSG.

AB This paper presents a method for controlling the output power of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) in strong wind conditions. Currently, most of wind turbines are stopped and disconnected from the power system when wind speeds reaches more then 25 m/s. This will lead to detrimental power and voltage fluctuations in the power system. To overcome this problem, output power, pitch angle and rotation speed command values are designated. A novel method, which includes pitch angle and rotation speed control is proposed. Simulation results show that the wind turbine can generate stable power during strong wind conditions.

ID INDUCTION GENERATOR; POWER; SYSTEM; OSCILLATIONS; STABILITY
AB Wind turbines (WTs) employing a wound rotor induction generator with adjustable external resistors are known as Type-2 WTs. This WT topology is available in USA since 2001. This WT is regulated by controlling its pitch angle and its external rotor resistor to operate as a variable slip WT. The slip range can reach up to 10% above synchronous speed. This paper demonstrates that with a proper control, Type-2 WTs are capable to damp out subsynchronous resonance (SSR) oscillations commonly found in series-compensated transmission lines. The size of wind power plant (WPP) has increased over the years and some WPP exceeds 500 MW. They can be treated as energy sources which can regulate the power delivered to the grid. In order to analyze the capability of Type-2 WPPs to damp power system oscillations, the IEEE first benchmark model for SSR studies is modified with an aggregated Type-2 WPP model connected to the system. An additional control loop is implemented to modulate the effective rotor resistance so that SSR oscillations can be damped. The models are implemented and simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software platform.

AB Wind turbine generators (WTGs) consist of many different components to convert kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy for end users. Wind energy is accessed to provide mechanical torque for driving the shaft of the electrical generator. The conversion from wind power to mechanical power is governed by the aerodynamic conversion. The aerodynamicelectrical- conversion efficiency of a WTG is influenced by the efficiency of the blades, the gearbox, the generator, and the power converter.
   This paper describes the use of MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the electrical and grid-related aspects of a WTG coupled with the FAST aero-elastic wind turbine computer-aided engineering tool to simulate the aerodynamic and mechanical aspects of a WTG. The combination of the two enables studies involving both electrical and mechanical aspects of a WTG. For example, mechanical engineers can formulate generator control that may preserve the life of the gearbox or mitigate the impact of transient events occurring on the transmission lines (faults, voltage and frequency dips, unbalanced voltages, etc.). Similarly, electrical engineers can study the impact of high-ramping wind speeds on power systems, as well as the impact of turbulence on the voltage and frequency of a small balancing area.

DE artificial wind; downdraft wind; wind energy
AB The ground based wind energy extraction systems have reached almost their maximum capability. With the uncertainties related to wind like the variable wind directions and significant variation over shorter time scale has been a major hurdle in complete harnessing of this energy. The wind industry needs of revolutionary ideas to increase the capabilities of wind installation. This article suggests a revolutionary innovation of producing artificial wind of constant direction and controlled magnitude the constant and continuous wind from a single direction would make the wind turbines work longer span during a year there by producing a dramatic increase in power production.
   The artificial wind production works on same physics as convective downdraft in nature are produced. By definition, downdrafts are nothing more than areas of downward moving air. Their scale and intensity can vary driven by cooling due to melting and evaporation of precipitation, condensate loading, and pressure forces.
   A skyscraper sized hollow cylinder is used to tunnel down the natural downdraft created by cooling down the hot dry ambient air using evaporation cooling technique. as the air cools it become denser than outside air and falls down channelized by the tower at the speed up to (and above) 10m/sec. at the bottom this fast descending air is directed through wind turbines installed over the circumference of tower at base of the tower generating electricity. The magnitude of downdraft can be controlled by controlling its negative buoyancy and precipitation loading. Prime production time of artificial wind plants would be the daytime and evening during spring, summer and fall. thereby closely aligning with the electricity demand patterns. Additionally external vertical blade turbines would capture any wind blowing including cold winter months and night. At most optimised state the power generated is estimated to be approximately on an hourly basis, of approx. 500 megawatt hours, gross. Using a 70 percent capacity factor the Tower's potential hourly yield would be 350 megawatt hours from which, approximately 17 percent will be used to power its operations, yielding approximately 300 megawatt hours available for sale to the power grid.

AB With growing concerns about environmental pollution and a possible energy shortage, great efforts have been taken by the governments around the world to implement renewable energy programs, based mainly on wind power, solar energy, small hydro-electric power, etc. Due to its many advantages such as the improved power quality, high energy efficiency and controllability, etc., the variable speed wind turbine using a double fed induction generator (DFIG) is becoming a popular concept and thus the modeling of the DFIG based wind turbine becomes an interesting research topic. In this paper the steady state analysis and control of double fed induction generator (DFIG) for variable speed wind energy conversion system is studied. The objective is to analyze the performance of DFIG under steady state conditions. Stator oriented flux vector control is employed to achieve the independent control of active and reactive power of the machine. The machine is modeled in vectorized form in a synchronous reference frame. The complete simulation model is developed for such machine under variable speed operation using MATLAB/SIMULINK environment for effectiveness of the study.

AB This paper presents an optimum design procedure for the coordinated tuning of rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC) controllers of grid connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine system. The RSC and GSC controller parameters are determined to optimize the performance indices. The performance indices considered are maximum peak overshoot (MPOS omega r), settling time (Tss(omega r)) of the generator speed and the maximum peak overshoot (MPOSVdc), maximum peak undershoot (MPUSVdc) and settling time (Tss(Vdc)) of DC link voltage. The sum squared error deviation of the dc link voltage and the generator speed is considered as the objective function. The constrained optimization problem is solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Simulations are performed on a sample system with DFIG based WECS. The effectiveness of the designed parameters using PSO is then compared with that obtained using simulated annealing (SA).

AB This paper presents the results of the estimated capacity factor differences of 55 wind turbines for nine resolutions of wind speed data. It is found that the utilization of low resolution mean wind speed data for energy output estimation may cause critical errors. Since wind speed is highly variable in time, utilization of low resolution mean wind speed data inevitably leads to a smoothing of the data, thus leading a loss of information and wind characteristics. The estimated capacity factor of wind turbines and the mean power density of a region can therefore change with data resolution. Noticeable capacity factor and wind power density differences were found among different resolution data sets. Therefore, high resolution mean wind speeds should be used when evaluating the economic and technical viability of wind energy project.

AB The paper describes a variable speed, doubly fed induction generator based, standalone power system supplying unbalanced and nonlinear load. A sensorless control method of the fundamental 50Hz harmonic uses a PLL for synchronization of the measured stator voltage vector with the reference one. Additional part of control includes feedbacks from the components of voltage asymmetry and harmonics, extracted in the adequate frames. The frames rotate at angular speeds corresponding to each harmonics and to a negative sequence of the fundamental one, respectively. A grid side converter control, besides its basic functionality eliminates the stator current asymmetry and harmonics to reduce the electromagnetic torque ripples. An improvement of generated voltage quality achieved by using the proposed extension of the sensorless stator voltage control method and adequate control of the grid side converter is shown based on the results of the laboratory tests on a small power unit.

ID MODEL; DESIGN; MOTOR
AB Wind turbine aerodynamics is known as a nonlinear and stochastic system; hence, a high-performance requirement of tight optimal regime tracking is beyond the capability of the conventional linear PI controller. On the other hand, the linear model of the nonlinear wind turbine aerodynamics at a specific operating point produces a mismatch between plant and model which is the main reason for reference tracking offset seen in a conventional predictive controller. This paper presents a new predictive control approach for variable speed wind turbines in order to guarantee maximum power captured under the rated wind speed. The proposed algorithm, offset-free predictive control (OF-PC), has been exploited to provide zero error tracking of the nonstationary optimal speed trajectory. The control scheme attempts to add additional output disturbance signals to the linear presentation of wind turbine aerodynamics together with an appropriate observer design to lump the plant-model mismatches and/or unmodeled disturbances. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control method.

AB This paper presents a sliding mode controller to address the problem of voltage regulation in microgrids involving doubly fed induction wind generators (DFIGs). The control objective is to achieve terminal voltage regulation while ensuring maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The control development is based on voltage sensitivity analysis to eliminate the possibility of interference with the other voltage regulation devices in the microgrid. The proposed method: 1) does not require synchronous coordinate transformation, 2) eliminates the need for decoupled proportional-integral (PI) loops, and 3) is local and can be implemented in the absence of widespread communication systems or remote measurements. Additionally, its control performance is not degraded by errors in system parameters. The performance of the method is illustrated on the IEEE 13-bus distribution network. Dynamic models are considered for the DFIG, converters, and internal controllers along with their operational limits. Stochastic fluctuations in wind speed are modeled with NREL Turbsim while accounting for the tower shadow and wind shear. Dynamic simulations (in PSCAD/EMTDC) are presented to assess the control performance with voltage fluctuation compensation and control system robustness.

AB Three different operational curves-the power curve, rotor curve, and blade pitch curve-are presented for monitoring a wind farm's performance. A five-year historical data set has been assembled for constructing the reference curves of wind power, rotor speed, and blade pitch angle, with wind speed as an input variable. A multivariate outlier detection approach based on kappa-means clustering and Mahalanobis distance is applied to this data to produce a data set for modeling turbines. Kurtosis and skewness of bivariate data are used as metrics to assess the performance of the wind turbines. Performance monitoring of wind turbines is accomplished with the Hotelling T-2 control chart.

AB Energy generation through wind energy conversion systems (WECS) is expected to supply a considerable amount of electricity in the world's generation matrix. In this context, variable-speed wind turbines equipped with full-scale power electronic converters allow a WECS to be operated close to its maximum power point at each time instant. Furthermore, modern power converter guarantee high power quality, high conversion efficiency levels, reliability and flexibility. This work reviews and compares two types of modulation schemes to two novel ones that are able to drive a Delta-switch rectifier. The presented theoretical analysis is based on a WECS application. Circuit simulation and experimental results verify the operation with the considered strategies. It is shown that one of the novel sub-optimal modulation patterns presents very high performance without the need of a precise sector identification scheme.

AB This paper presents a voltage and frequency control of wind-hydro hybrid system in isolated locations in which one squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine and another SCIG driven by a constant power hydro turbine feeding three phase four wire local loads. The system mainly uses a rectifier and a pulse width modulation controlled insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor-based voltage-source converters (VSCs) with a battery energy storage system at their dc link. The main objectives of the rectifier is to convert the ac power generated by the wind system to dc and the control algorithm for the VSC is the control of the magnitude and the frequency of the load voltage. This system has the capability of bidirectional active-and reactive-power flow, by which it controls the magnitude and the frequency of the load voltage. Here pitch angle control is used to achieve maximum power tracking(MPT). In this paper wind turbine, hydro turbine, MPT controller, and a voltage and frequency controller are modeled and simulated in MATLAB using Simulink and Sim Power System set toolboxes, and different aspects of the proposed system are studied for various types of loads, and under varying wind-speed conditions. The performance of the proposed system is presented to demonstrate its capability of MPT, voltage and frequency control (VFC), harmonic elimination, and load balancing.

AB We present a framework aimed at estimating the potential damage to an offshore wind farm from hurricanes. Our approach is related to assessing risks that are assumed to be fundamentally related to the estimation of wind speed exceedance probabilities at selected hub heights of wind turbines in the farm and of associated wind turbine loads. As part of this preliminary framework for risk assessment, synthetic storm tracks are first simulated over the ocean using available historical tropical storm data; then, a hurricane intensity evolution model based on thermodynamic and atmospheric environmental variables is developed for each of the tracks as they get to regions within the proximity of the chosen wind farm site. Based on this intensity model, a turbulent wind field can be simulated at locations of interest along the hurricane track. The simulated turbulent wind field may then be used to estimate wind speed exceedance probability distributions and, when combined with correlated waves, it can also be used in analysis of the response of individual turbines in a wind farm. The framework for the overall risk assessment is presented; the individual components that comprise such an assessment are described briefly in illustrative applications.

AB An optimum control approach for a wind turbine drivetrain with a variable ratio gearbox is presented. The objective is to find the optimum shifting sequence of the variable ratio gearbox in order to maximize power generation and extend gear life. The employment of a variable ratio gearbox enhances the capabilities of the wind turbine to cope with wind speed variations. Based on our preliminary study, the gear ratios of the variable ratio gearbox were carefully selected to increase the wind energy capture. We then propose a new control approach to extend the gear service life. It finds the gear shifting sequence that will minimize the tangential force on the gear tooth. The wind turbine drivetrain with a variable ratio gearbox is modeled and simulation results for two sets of recorded wind data are presented and compared.

AB Wind turbines commonly operate in an uncertain and noisy environment. Disturbance accommodating controller (DAC) has shown promising results in dealing with changing wind speed to regulate generator speed at its rated speed in above rated wind speed condition. However, it has been reported that the number of considered system modes (or degrees of freedom) in design of DAC affects the system performance. Simulation using high order model, higher than that is considered in the control design, showed unstable response due to effect from the unmodeled structural dynamics. In this study, DAC with Kalman estimator is designed for variable pitch wind turbines to take into account the unmodeled dynamics and noise measurement. The control performance is simulated using high order FAST model that has active generator, drive-train, blade, and tower dynamics in Simulink environment. Simulation results show that DAC with Kalman estimator gives best performance in terms of speed regulation and control cost, compared to two other linear controllers: Gain Scheduled Proportional Integral (GSPI) controller and DAC with linear estimator.

AB The present grid is accommodating mixed energies resulting into increasing complexities and instabilities. The dynamic performance is measured by also considering the impact the integration of new technologies such as distributed generation (DG) and hybrid distributed generation (HDG) have on the grid. Hybrid distributed generation with one or more renewable (stochastic) energy sources interact with the existing grid during import and export of power generation. This interaction contributes more fault current therefore making the system vulnerable to instability more than a single energy source. This study investigates the dynamic impact of hybrid Wind/ PV/small Hydro power on transient stability. To investigate this impact, a detail modeling of grid connected wind / solar PV and small hydropower system with single machine infinite system is carried out. The simulation was done in DIgSILENT power factory software. The configuration of the proposed typical grid connected hybrid distributed generation (HDG) consists of variable speed Wind turbine with doubly -fed induction generator (DFIG), solar PV and small hydropower system. The wind turbine is integrated through PWM converter into the existing Grid while the solar PV incorporated into the system consists of DC sources integrated through PWM inverter and the hydro power is directly connected through a synchronous generator.

AB Faults of wind turbine generator electromechanical parts are common and very expensive. This paper introduces a generator fault-tolerant control scheme for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines that can be applied regardless to the AC generator used. The focus is on generator stator isolation inter-turn fault that can be diagnosed and characterised before triggering the safety device. An extension of the conventional wind turbine control structure is proposed that prevents the fault propagation while power delivery under fault is deteriorated as less as possible compared to healthy machine conditions. Fault-induced and inherent asymmetries of the generator are estimated and respected by the field-oriented control of the generator to eliminate torque oscillations. An approach for asymmetry detection based on an unscented Kalman filter is proposed. Presented fault-tolerant control strategy is developed taking into account its modular implementation and installation in available control systems of existing wind turbines to extend their exploitable life span and increase energy production. Simulation results for the case of a megawatt class wind turbine are presented.

AB The key technology of variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) brushless doubly-fed generator(BDFG) was getting the maximum power under the variable wind speed by adjusting the rotor speed of the induction generator according. Wind turbine systems had many uncertain factors with strong nonlinear multivariable with and disturbances. Based on the prototype of wind electricity conversion system (WECS), a new maximum power point tracking control which is realized by self-adaptive controller strategy for variable speed constant frequency wind generation system has been developed in this paper. A experiment platform of a 8kW laboratory variable speed constant frequency wind generation system controlled by TMS320LF2812 and TMS320VC33 was developed. Experimental results show that the system can operate at the expected points in the wide range of wind velocities and realize the control of maximum power point tracking very well.

AB This paper proposes an alternative robust observer-based linear control technique to maximize energy capture in a 4.8 MW horizontal-axis variable-speed wind turbine. The proposed strategy uses a generalized proportional integral (GPI) observer to reconstruct the aerodynamic torque in order to obtain a generator speed optimal trajectory. Then, a robust GPI observer-based controller supported by an active disturbance rejection (ADR) approach allows asymptotic tracking of the generator speed optimal trajectory. The proposed methodology controls the power coefficient, via the generator angular speed, towards an optimum point at which power coefficient is maximum. Several simulations (including an actuator fault) are performed on a 4.8 MW wind turbine benchmark model in order to validate the proposed control strategy and to compare it to a classical controller. Simulation and validation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of power capture and robustness.

AB This paper elaborates on the analysis and simulation of a megawatt Wind Turbine (WT) driving low speed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based on Current Source Converter (CSC) using PSIM computer simulation program. The system consists of wind turbine, PMSG, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and three-phase CSC models. In the WT model, the best performance coefficient has been determined according to the variable wind speed with MPPT control. The gear-box has been eliminated by the low speed PMSG to achieve high efficiency. The ac power output from PMSG is fed to a three-phase CSC, which extracts maximum power through closed-loop regulation of generator speed. The current source PWM inverter is used to interface the system with the electrical utility. The available maximum power fed to the grid is adjusted by regulating dc-link output current of CSC according to the variable wind speed.

ID SYSTEM
AB Different types of generators are currently being used in wind power technology. The commonly used are induction generator (IG), doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG), electrically excited synchronous generator (EESG) and permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). However, the use of PMSG is rapidly increasing because of advantages such as higher power density, better controllability and higher reliability. This paper presents an innovative design of a low-speed modular, direct-drive axial flux permanent magnet (AFPM) generator with coreless stator and rotor for a wind turbine power generation system that is developed using mathematical and analytical methods. This innovative design is implemented in MATLAB / Simulink environment using dynamic modelling techniques. The main focus of this research is to improve efficiency of the wind power generation system by investigating electromagnetic and structural features of AFPM generator during its operation in wind turbine. The design is validated by comparing its performance with standard models of existing wind power generators. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed model for the wind power generator exhibits number of advantages such as improved efficiency with variable speed operation, higher energy yield, lighter weight and better wind power utilization.

AB Based on BLADED software, the aerodynamic performance of a large scale wind turbine blade was analyzed under variable condition. The results show that the rated power of the blade under variable condition is increased 10%, when the rated wind speed is changed from 10.5m/s to 11.0 m/s. The blade's wind power coefficient is above 0.46, and its tip speed ratio is between 7.8 and 11.4. When its tip speed ratio is 9.5, the blade's maximum wind power coefficient is 0.486. It is indicated that the blade has good aerodynamic performance and wide scope of wind speed adaptive capacity. The blade root's equivalent fatigue load is 2.11 MN.m, and its extreme flapwise load is 4.61 MN.m. The loads under variable condition are both less than that of the designed condition, so the blade's application under variable condition is safe.

AB In order to accurately obtain the influence of rotational effect on fluctuating component of turbulent wind acted on wind turbine, considering source spectrum and rotational sample points were changed since wind shear changed mean wind speed in the rotor plane along the vertical direction, rotational Fourier spectrum with wind shear was deduced. Based on the investigation on a 3MW three-bladed pitch regulated wind turbine, rotational Fourier spectrums with and without wind shear were compared, the effect of radius on rotational Fourier spectrum was analyzed, cross power spectral densities of rotational Fourier spectrum with different blades and variable radius were compared. The results show that the effect of wind shear on amplitude of rotational Fourier spectrum is unconspicuous while the phase frequency characteristic is alternative for the sample points are changed. Rotational Fourier spectrum energy removes to the high frequency bands, the amplitudes of peak at the integer multiple rotational frequencies increase with radius increases. The initial phase has little influence to the amplitude of spectrum, and cross power spectral densities of different radius are obviously less than auto power spectral densities of the same radius.

AB Vector control algorithms reported so far for stand alone operation of variable speed constant frequency double output induction generators propose to supply the full magnetisation current of the machine in addition to the torque producing component from the rotor side converter. As the rotor of a normal induction machine is not designed for this additional load this approach leads to underutilisation of the machine torque capacity. Moreover, supplying the entire magnetisation current from the rotor side is not optimal from the point of view of the machine losses. Since the load voltage is regulated by manipulating the magnetising current through a slow acting flux control loop undesirable fluctuations in the load voltage waveforms are observed during fast load transients. An improved stator flux oriented control strategy for this type of generators, proposed in this study, eliminates undesirable load voltage transients by directly regulating the stator flux through the stator side converter. The total reactive power demand of the system is dynamically distributed between the two converters according to an optimum allocation program so as to minimise the losses without disturbing the stator flux. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified experimentally on a laboratory prototype.

A three-dimensional flow simulation method is employed to design the adjustable torque converter. Circulatory circle is determined after the structure optimization of the torque converter. The blades are designed by the conformal projection law, and then the adjustable device's structure is determined. The performance of torque converter with the variation guide vanes is analyzed by using numerical simulation. The calculated results show that the new torque converter could meet the needs of the wind turbine transmission system.

AB Wind energy is one of the major renewable energy sources which continue to be one of the fastest growing power generation sectors. For variable speed operation of wind energy conversion system, it is required to generate the maximum power at below the rated speed using an authentic and powerful control strategy. Wind speed has the major impact on the dynamics and control of wind turbines. But in practice there is no accurate measurement of effective wind speed available for direct measurement. In this paper a new technique is proposed for optimal power generation of wind turbine below rated speed without estimating the wind speed. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the rotor speed and a proportional (P) controller is used to track the error between the measured and estimated rotor speed. The output of the P controller is the estimated aerodynamic torque. The estimated aerodynamic torque and the rotor speed act as an input to the aerodynamic torque feed-forward (ATF) controller. The output of the ATF controller is the generated torque. As the aerodynamic torque is highly dependent on the wind speed so it cannot be controlled. So we have to control the generated torque by using ATF for generating optimal power output. Finally the estimated outputs are validated through correlation analysis.

AB Both rotor aerodynamic characteristics and structural performance of the blade are critical to the wind turbine system service life; an accurate loading model of the blade is extraordinary complex due to the complexity of the geometry shape and variety of blade thickness. In this paper, a 10KW fixed-pitch variable-speed wind turbine blade with five different thickness of aerofoil shape along the span of the blade is presented as a case study, main parameters of the wind turbine rotor and the blade aerodynamic geometry shape are determined based on the principles of the blade element momentum (BEM) theory, a specific blade internal structure and layup schedule are designed. Based on the FE method, deflections and strain distributions of the designed blade under extreme wind conditions are numerically predicted. Theoretical and numerical results indicate that aerodynamic characteristics of the designed blade meet the requirement, the tip clearance is sufficient to prevent collision with the tower, and the blade material is linear and safe.

AB Switched reluctance generator (SRG) has a promising prospect for variable speed wind energy application because of its ruggedness, advantage cost, simplicity and ability to work over wide speed ranges. This paper presents the application of a single neuron adaptive PID algorithm to the problem of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control in the wind power system using SRG, and a 750W, three phase (6/4) SRG prototype is chosen for the study. The nonlinear characteristics of the SRG and the wind turbine are described firstly, then the optimal speed tracking strategy based on the single neuron adaptive PID control for MPPT of the wind power system using SRG is investigated in the paper. Based on the developed model in MATLAB environment, simulation studies are performed in various conditions including a step change in the wind speed or in the load of SRG. Simulation results show the control system can quickly and steadily track the optimal curve to realize the MPPT with excellent dynamic and static performances, which verify the effectiveness of the control strategy investigated in the paper.

AB This paper presents a method for determining optimal sizes of PV array, wind turbine, diesel generator, and storage battery installed in a building integrated system. The objective of the proposed optimization is to design the system that can supply a building load demand at minimum cost and maximum availability. The mathematical models for the system components as well as meteorological variables such as solar energy, temperature, and wind speed are employed for this purpose. Moreover, the results showed that the optimum sizing ratios (the daily energy generated by the source to the daily energy demand) for the PV array, wind turbine, diesel generator, and battery for a system located in Sohar, Oman, are 0.737, 0.46, 0.22, and 0.17, respectively. A case study represented by a system consisting of 30kWp PV array (36%), 18 kWp wind farm(55%), and 5 kVA diesel generator (9%) is presented. This system is supposed to power a 200 kWh/day load demand. It is found that the generated energy share of the PV array, wind farm, and diesel generator is 36%, 55%, and 9%, respectively, while the cost of energy is 0.17USD/kWh.
