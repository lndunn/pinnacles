AB Emphasis in this article is on variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs) capability to provide short-term overproduction and better understanding of VSWTs' mechanical and electrical limits to deliver such support. VSWTs' short-term overproduction capability is of primary concern for the transmission system operators (TSOs) in the process of restoring critical situations during large frequency excursions in power systems with high wind power penetration.
   This study is conducted on a simplified generic model for VSWTs with full scale power converter (Type IV), which includes several adjustments and extensions of the Type IV standard wind turbine model proposed by the IEC Committee in IEC 61400-27-1. This modified standard model is able to account for dynamic features relevant for integrating active power ancillary services in wind power plants, such as frequency support capabilities.
   The performance of VSWTs during short-term overproduction is assessed and discussed by means of simulations for different wind speed levels, overproduction percentages and durations. The results show that the capability of VSWTs providing short-term overproduction to the grid strongly depends on the initial pre-overproduction conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This portfolio is created using a single time series and it is based on a number of time series characteristics, previously proposed, and a set of novel time series features. The results show that the proposed portfolio produces accurate predictions, and, has better performance than the forecasters composing it. In addition to this, the forecast values are used to determine the power generation capacity of a wind turbine driven a permanent magnet synchronous generator. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a method for multidisciplinary design optimization of offshore wind turbines at system level. The formulation and implementation that enable the integrated aerodynamic and structural design of the rotor and tower simultaneously are detailed. The objective function to be minimized is the levelized cost of energy. The model includes various design constraints: stresses, deflections, modal frequencies and fatigue limits along different stations of the blade and tower. The rotor design variables are: chord and twist distribution, blade length, rated rotational speed and structural thicknesses along the span. The tower design variables are: tower thickness and diameter distribution, as well as the tower height. For the other wind turbine components, a representative mass model is used to include their dynamic interactions in the system. To calculate the system costs, representative cost models of a wind turbine located in an offshore wind farm are used. To show the potential of the method and to verify its usefulness, the 5 MW NREL wind turbine is used as a case study. The result of the design optimization process shows 2.3% decrease in the levelized cost of energy for a representative Dutch site, while satisfying all the design constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel pitch control system is proposed for wind turbine to smooth output power and load fluctuations. This system is driven by a servo-valve controlled hydraulic motor and is precisely controlled to track the desired pitch angle trajectory. Nonlinear modeling and characteristics of this system are presented and analyzed. An adaptive nonlinear sliding mode pitch angle controller is designed to deal with the uncertainties and external disturbances in this system. An integrated pitch control strategy is proposed to generate the reference pitch commands for this system by considering the load reductions. The proposed system, pitch controller, and the control strategy have been validated for efficient and accurate pitch control performances by comparative experimental results under realistic wind speeds.

Stator windings of the motor are fed from the power system, while the feeding for the rotor ones is provided by a cycloconverter. Expressions for all characteristic variables are derived on the basis of a mathematical model defined for particular operating conditions. Rotor voltage regulation laws, which ensure optimal motor operation according to predetermined criteria and apply to the entire regulated speed range, are defined from the obtained expressions.

ID SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS; OBSERVER; GENERATION; FLUX
AB This paper proposes a space-vector modulation (SVM)-based direct-torque control (DTC) scheme for a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) used in a variable-speed direct-drive wind power generation system. A quasi-sliding-mode observer that uses a relatively low sampling frequency, e.g., 5 or 10 kHz, is proposed to estimate the rotor position and stator flux linkage based on the current model of the PMSG over a wide operating range. The optimal torque command is directly obtained from the estimated rotor speed for the DTC by which the maximum power point tracking control of the wind turbine generator is achieved without the need for wind speed or rotor position sensors. Compared with the conventional DTC, the proposed SVM-DTC achieves a fixed switching frequency and greatly reduces the flux and torque ripples, while retaining the fast dynamic response of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed SVM-DTC scheme is verified by simulation studies on a 1.5-MW PMSG wind turbine and is further verified by experimental results on a 2.4-kW PMSG with a 10-kHz sampling frequency.

ID NONLINEAR CONTROL; FEEDBACK CONTROL; PERFORMANCE; MODEL
AB This study suggests a moving horizon H-infinity control scheme for variable speed wind turbines above the rated wind speed to maintain the output power at the rated value for variable operating points. A constrained H-infinity control problem is solved at each sampling time with the update of not only the initial condition but also the prediction model based on different operating points. Closed-loop properties inclusive of L-2 disturbance attenuation are discussed in the framework of dissipation theory. The moving horizon H-infinity control considers the non-linear dynamic aspect of the wind turbine, the turbulent nature of the wind and actuator saturations. Analysis and simulation results for WD34 wind turbine show possible improvements on the output electrical power regulation performance for variable operating points, while respecting actuator saturation limits.

AB This work studies the impact on power system dynamics of wind energy conversion systems based on permanent magnet synchronous generators when they perform ancillary services. The ability of modern variable-speed wind turbines to rapidly modify its active and reactive power is exploited in order to provide additional support to the power grid and enhance the overall stability of the system. A set of control loops are incorporated to the wind farm in order to achieve three supporting tasks: short-term frequency regulation, oscillation damping and voltage regulation. The analysis contemplates the effects of different loading conditions, measurement/communication time delays and control loop gains. Bifurcation diagrams, eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time-domain simulations are used to assess the power system dynamics. The main contribution of this work is the assessment of wind farm ancillary services on the bifurcation structure of the power system.

These are separated into basic hands-on laboratory and advanced simulation-based experiments. The basic experiments are integrated into an undergraduate course that includes topics such as the steady-state operation of induction machines, fixed-speed, and variable-speed wind turbines. Advanced experiments are integrated into a stand-alone course dedicated to wind energy and power systems. Topics include the modeling of aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical components for each type of wind turbine along with their steady-state and dynamic operations. The experiments were originally designed at the University of Texas at Austin. Their transferability to a different laboratory platform at the University of Texas Pan American is also discussed.

AB The optimal design of Hybrid Photo Voltaic-Wind Turbine (PV-WT) grid connected power generation systems (PGSs) is not an easy or straightforward task, as the best configuration depends on many different uncertain socio-economic and environment variables, design parameters, technical constraints and government and policy maker interests. In this context, this work deals with the optimal design of grid connected PV-WT PGSs, achieved by using a suitable procedure based on a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) optimization approach. The method takes into consideration all the aforementioned issues, working toward optimizing amount of reduced emissions, total costs, and social acceptability, and providing a clear overview of the most suitable PV-WT design configurations. The proposed approach has been applied to different case studies and uncertainty analysis related to solar radiation, wind speed and load demand profiles variations has been carried out using a probabilistic approach; in addition, different criteria weights have been adopted for sensitivity analysis, where the importance of each design parameter has been assumed to be uncertain, and its effect on the final optimal design is investigated. Results confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach, which could be assumed as a powerful decision making tool in designing hybrid renewable energy grid connected PGSs.

AB To achieve economic and environmental benefit for the stand-alone microgrid consisting of diesel generators, wind turbine generators, photovoltaic generation system and lead-acid batteries, a multi-objective stochastic optimal planning method and a stochastic chance-constrained programming model are presented. In the model, the optimal objective is to simultaneously minimise the total net present cost and carbon dioxide emission in life cycle; the type and capacity of distributed generation units have been selected as the optimal variables; the loss of capacity is adopted as probability index constraint; the coordinated operation strategies between diesel generators and battery, the multi-unit operation constraints of diesel generators and the reserve capacity have been considered in the hard-circle operation strategy. Considering the uncertainties of wind speed, clearness index and load demand, Markov process transition probability matrix is adopted to synthesise those time series data. Optimal planning for an island microgrid system has been carried out by the planning system for microgrid (PSMG), a self-developed optimal planning software based on the multi-objective stochastic optimal planning method for stand-alone microgrid system.

AB This paper focuses on the modeling of mechanical and structural vibrations in wind turbines due to the occurrence of electrical faults and an effective means of suppressing the vibrations with flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices. A detailed model describing the dynamic interaction between the mechanical and the electrical subsystems of the turbine is presented. The model captures the effect of grid faults on the mechanical vibrations of drivetrain, flexible rotor blades and tower. Numerical investigation reveals that electrical disturbances have a significant impact on the mechanical/structural vibrations. In fact, the occurrence of severe vibrations due to voltage sags may compromise safe operation of the overall plant. The application of FACTS devices is then considered to suppress the effect of electrical fault-induced vibrations. The performance comparison of static synchronous compensator and unified power quality conditioner devices in improving the mechanical/structural response has been carried out. A fault scenario compliant with Irish grid code has been simulated. Simulation results show that FACTS devices are successfully able to mitigate vibrations due to electrical faults, and they can be conveniently applied to stabilize the generator shaft speed, drivetrain oscillations, edgewise blade vibrations and tower responses. Further, superior performances of the unified power quality conditioner as compared with static synchronous compensator are also observed under certain conditions with increased fault duration.

AB An infinitely variable transmission (IVT) to provide a continuous output-to-input speed ratio from zero to a certain value is designed, and its working principle is illustrated. It is a geared IVT (GIVT), since its function to achieve the continuously varied speed ratio is implemented by gears. Crank-slider systems are used in the GIVT; the output-to-input speed ratio is changed with the crank length. Racks and pinions, whose motion is controlled by planetary gear sets, are used to change the crank length when the cranks rotate. One-way bearings are used to rectify output speeds from different crank-slider systems to obtain the output speed of the GIVT. Since the crank-slider systems can introduce variations of the instantaneous speed ratio, a pair of noncircular gears is designed to minimize the variations. A direction control system is also designed for the GIVT using planetary gear sets. Finally, a vehicle start-up simulation and a wind turbine simulation to maintain a constant generator speed are developed based on a GIVT module in the Matlab Simulink environment.

This optimization is concretized by two methods, namely, the Maximum Power Point Tracking 'MPPT' algorithm in the case where the characteristic of the turbine is known and the nonlinear method based on the theory of fuzzy logic controlled torque which is most appropriate when there is a lack of information on the characteristic (C-p (lambda)) of the turbine. However, the limitation of power is performed by action on the generator control only. Simulation results are presented and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work is aimed at optimizing the wind turbine rotor speed setpoint algorithm. Several intelligent adjustment strategies have been investigated in order to improve a reward function that takes into account the power captured from the wind and the turbine speed error. After different approaches including Reinforcement Learning, the best results were obtained using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based wind turbine speed setpoint algorithm. A reward improvement of up to 10.67% has been achieved using PSO compared to a constant approach and 0.48% compared to a conventional approach. We conclude that the pitch angle is the most adequate input variable for the turbine speed setpoint algorithm compared to others such as rotor speed, or rotor angular acceleration.

AB Energy storage systems (ESSs) appear as a viable solution to some of the stability and intermittency problems of wind power generation. As a consequence, it is crucial to develop adequate control strategies that allow the coordinate operation of both energy sources. Moreover, in order to minimize the impact of large wind farms on the power system, many countries have set strict grid codes that wind power generators must accomplish. Hence, it is also necessary to pay due attention to the fault ride through capabilities of these hybrid systems. In this paper two different hybrid configurations are modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, consisting on a doubly fed induction generator driven wind turbine and electrochemical batteries as ESS. They are simulated and compared under various operating conditions (i.e. real fluctuating wind speed input with variable active and reactive power grid demand, voltage sags, three-phase and single-phase fault to ground, and overvoltage). A conventional wind turbine without ESS is also considered as a base-case in order to highlight the main benefits of the hybrid schemes. The results show that by implementing one of the presented control strategies, it is possible to enhance the response to faults of the hybrid systems, achieving higher active power injection and helping the recovery to steady-state, thus improving the grid connection capabilities of hybrid wind farms.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear control approach to variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) with a wind speed estimator. The dynamics of the wind turbine (WT) is derived from single mass model. In this work, a modified Newton Raphson estimator has been considered for exact estimation of effective wind speed. The main objective of this work is to extract maximum energy from the wind at below rated wind speed while reducing drive train oscillation. In order to achieve the above objectives, VSWT should operate close to the optimal power coefficient. The generator torque is considered as the control input to achieve maximum energy capture. From the literature, it is clear that existing linear and nonlinear control techniques suffer from poor tracking of WT dynamics, increased power loss and complex control law. In addition, they are not robust with respect to input disturbances. In order to overcome the above drawbacks, adaptive fuzzy integral sliding mode control (AFISMC) is proposed for VSWT control. The proposed controller is tested with different types of disturbances and compared with other nonlinear controllers such as sliding mode control and integral sliding mode control. The result shows the better performance of AFISMC and its robustness to input disturbances. In this paper, the discontinuity in integral sliding mode controller is smoothed by using hyperbolic tangent function, and the sliding gain is adapted using a fuzzy technique which makes the controller more robust.

AB This paper presents a low power wind energy conversion system (WECS) based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator and a high power factor (PF) rectifier. To achieve a high PF at the generator side, a power processing scheme based on a diode rectifier and a boost DC-DC converter working in discontinuous conduction mode is proposed. The proposed generator control structure is based on three cascaded control loops that regulate the generator current, the turbine speed and the amount of power that is extracted from the wind, respectively, following the turbine aerodynamics and the actual wind speed. The analysis and design of both the current and the speed loops have been carried out taking into consideration the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the WECS, as well as the turbine aerodynamics. The power loop is not a linear one, but a maximum power point tracking algorithm, based on the Perturb and Observe technique, from which is obtained the reference signal for the speed loop. Finally, to avoid the need of mechanical sensors, a linear Kalman Filter has been chosen to estimate the generator speed. Simulation and experimental results on a 2-kW prototype are shown to validate the concept. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The aim of this report is to present a model of a rigid-rotor system based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is applied on a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) research. Its originality results from the use of the average value of the variable rotational speed method taken in a periodic steady-state (PSS) of the VAWT rotor instead of the classical fixed rotational speed method. This approach was chosen in order to determine the mechanical and aerodynamic parameters of the wind turbine. The modeling method uses an implicit Euler iterative solution strategy, which resolves the coupling between fixed and moving rotor domains. The main methods that were adopted are based on the three-dimensional modeling of the interaction of the fluid flow with a rigid-rotor. The strategy consists of using the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations with the standard k- epsilon and SST k- omega models to solve the fluid flow problem. To perform the rigid-rotor motion in a fluid, the one degree of freedom (1-DOF) method was applied. In the present study, the steady-state and dynamic CFD simulations of the Savonius rotor are adopted to contribute to the validation elements of the VAWT models that are used. The dynamic study allows the investigation of the rotor behavior and the relation between velocity, pressure, and vorticity fields in and around the rotor blades. The flow fields generated by the rotation of the Savonius rotor were investigated in the half revolution period of the rotor angle theta from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. In this range of theta, the focus is on generating and dissipating vortices. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID ENERGY-PRODUCTION; GENERATION
AB Ageing is a fact of life. Just as with conventional forms of power generation, the energy produced by a wind farm gradually decreases over its lifetime, perhaps due to falling availability, aerodynamic performance or conversion efficiency. Understanding these factors is however complicated by the highly variable availability of the wind.
   This paper reveals the rate of ageing of a national fleet of wind turbines using free public data for the actual and theoretical ideal load factors from the UK's 282 wind farms. Actual load factors are recorded monthly for the period of 2002-2012, covering 1686 farm-years of operation. Ideal load factors are derived from a high resolution wind resource assessment made using NASA data to estimate the hourly wind speed at the location and hub height of each wind farm, accounting for the particular models of turbine installed.
   By accounting for individual site conditions we confirm that load factors do decline with age, at a similar rate to other rotating machinery. Wind turbines are found to lose 1.6 +/- 0.2% of their output per year, with average load factors declining from 28.5% when new to 21% at age 19. This trend is consistent for different generations of turbine design and individual wind farms. This level of degradation reduces a wind farm's output by 12% over a twenty year lifetime, increasing the levelised cost of electricity by 9%. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Implementation of proportional-integral controllers in synchronous reference frame is a well-established current control solution for electric machines. Nevertheless, their gain selection is still regarded to be poorly reported, particularly in relation to the influence of the computation and modulation delay. To fill this gap, a design procedure to set the maximum gains for an acceptable damped response, with the delay being considered, has been recently proposed. In contrast, this paper presents a simple rule of thumb to achieve nearly the minimum settling time in combination with negligible overshoot for reference changes. This conclusion is theoretically demonstrated by the analysis of root locus diagrams and of overshoot versus settling time trajectories for sweeps of gain values. The design approaches aimed at gain maximization and the one developed here are compared, revealing that the latter provides shorter settling time and much lower overshoot in the command tracking response, while allowing greater stability margins. On the other hand, the proposed tuning method leads to a worse disturbance rejection, but by including an active resistance with enhanced pole/zero cancellation as a second degree of freedom, both design procedures attain comparable and optimized attenuation of disturbances. Matching simulation and experimental results validate the theoretical study.

AB This work presents a design methodology for a hybrid energy system based on multiple renewable power sources and bioethanol. The new concept of generation consists on having multiple power sources such as a PEM fuel cell system fed by the hydrogen produced by a bioethanol reformer and wind-solar sources working all together supervised by the energy management system. The necessary heating for the bioethanol reforming reaction can be provided by the renewable sources to enhance the efficiency of the hydrogen production. It is worth noting that, from the power balance as well as backup point of views, the hybrid system is equipped with energy storage devices. An optimal sizing methodology integrated with the energy management strategy is proposed here for designing the overall hybrid system. The suggested approach is based on genetic algorithms, using historical climate data and load demands over a period of one year. Several simulation results are given to show the methodology performance in terms of loss of power supply probability (LPSP), costs and bioethanol consumption.

AB Analysis results, obtained from numerical simulation, for non-linear and unsteady aeroelastic behavior of large horizontal-axis wind turbines are presented in this paper. Simulations are carried out using a partitioned scheme of weak interaction that allows dealing with the fluid structure interaction problem by using one method to solve the structural-dynamic problem and another method for the aerodynamic problem.
   The aerodynamic model used is the non-linear, unsteady vortex lattice method (NLUVLM). The structural model used is a system of beam finite elements and rigid bodies with finite rotation. This provides a very general tool with relatively low computational cost.
   The proposed method allows predicting from the operating conditions (wind speed and direction, pitch angle of blades, etc.) the aeroelastic response of wind turbines, characterized by variables such as rotation speed of the rotor, loads on the structural components and the extracted power, among others.

AB Abstract-One critical task in wind turbine shaft torsional vibration study involves the modeling of a wind turbine and power grid. With a focus on the mechanical rotational system of wind turbine, this article provides a three-mass shaft model upon which one wind turbine to infinite bus model can be developed. The model, based on small-signal stability analysis, is used to study the wind turbine shaft torsional vibration. For this reason, this article concentrates on the union model of stall wind turbine and power grid. The small-signal stability model includes the mechanical system and electrical system. Data for the turbine's blades and shaft as well as electrical generator are given to allow replication of the model in its entirety. Each of the component blocks of the wind turbine and power grid is modeled separately so that one can easily expand and modify the model to simulate variable-speed wind turbines or multi-turbines system to suit their needs. This is then followed by a case study that explains how the small-signal stability model can be used to study wind turbine shaft torsional vibration issues. Results obtained from the case study show that the model performs as expected.

AB This paper investigates the enhancement in voltage stability achieved while connecting a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driven electrically excited synchronous generator (EESG) into power systems. The wind energy conversion system (WECS) uses an AC-DC-AC converter system with an uncontrolled rectifier, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controlled dc-dc boost converter and adaptive hysteresis controlled voltage source converter (VSC). The MPPT controller senses the rectified voltage (VDC) and traces the maximum power point to effectively maximize the output power. With MPPT and adaptive hysteresis band current control in VSC, the DC link voltage is maintained constant under variable wind speeds and transient grid currents. The effectiveness of the proposed WECS in enhancing voltage stability is analysed on a standard IEEE 5 bus system, which includes examining the voltage magnitude, voltage collapse and reactive power injected by the systems. Simulation results show that the proposed WECS has the potential to improve the long-term voltage stability of the grid by injecting reactive power. The performance of this scheme is compared with a fixed speed squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG), a variable speed doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and a variable speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG).

AB Wind power has gained space in Brazil's energy matrix, being a clean source and inexhaustible. Therefore, it becomes important to characterize the wind potential of a given location, for future applications. The main objective of the present study was to estimate the wind energy potential in Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. The wind speed data were collected by an anemometer installed at the Meteorological Station Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture, Piracicaba-SP. The wind speed variability was represented by the Weibull frequency distribution, a probability density function of two parameters (k and c). The parameters k and c were used to correlate the Gamma function with the annual average wind speed, the variance and power mean density. A wind profile was made to evaluate the behavior of historical average speeds at higher altitudes measured by anemometer, to estimate the gain in power density. The values of k for all heights were close to 1 which corresponds to a wind regime highly variable, and c values were also low representing a low average speed of the location. The location was characterized as being unfavorable for the application of wind turbines for power generation.

AB Emphasis of this article is on the dynamic characteristics analysis of individual pitch control for MW scale directly driven wind turbines with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The pitch control objectives were analyzed and the objective expressions were deduced, including power expression, loads expression, and vibration expressions of blade and tower. Then, both the collective pitch control aiming at power control and the individual pitch control strategy aiming at joint power and loads control were analyzed, too. The blade root bending moments and the actual capture power of wind rotor were employed to be the control variables. The power was calculated based on the conventional measured parameters of wind turbines. In order to reflect the difference between the pitch angle command value and the actual value, the pitch actuator dynamic model was used. The research results show that both the collective pitch control strategy and the proposed individual pitch control strategy can effectively control the power injected into grid; moreover, the individual pitch control can reduce fatigue loads; while in the process of individual pitch control, the actual variation of blade pitch angle is closely related to not only the inflow speed but also the blade azimuth angle; individual pitch control strategy can reduce the variation amplitude of flapwise moments, but has little influence on the edgewise moments.

AB The benefit of wind turbine (WT) can be significantly improved through a well-organized condition-based maintenance strategy. However, such a target has not been fully achieved today. One of the major reasons is lack of an efficient WT condition monitoring system (CMS). The existing WT CMSs often involve high initial capital cost, with complex structure, suffer from inefficient management and show unsatisfactory hardware reliability. So, the operators still have desire for an economical, effective, and reliable CMS for their machines. The work reported in this paper is intended to meet such a demand. Because direct drive permanent magnet (PM) WTs are showing increased market share, but the existing WT CMSs are not designed to deal specifically with this new design, this paper reports on a CM technique dedicated to monitoring the drive train of direct drive WTs. Instead of taking the vibration analysis approach that is being popularly adopted by commercial WT CMSs, a novel CM strategy is researched in this paper by introducing generator electrical signals into WT CM and interpreting them by using a dedicated criterion named instantaneous variance (IV) and Teager-Huang transform (THT), i.e. the generator electrical signals will be evaluated first by using the IV, of which the fault detection capability can be further enhanced with the aid of empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Once an abnormality is detected, then detailed THT analysis of the signal will be conducted for further investigation. The technique has been verified experimentally on a specifically designed WT drive train test rig, on which a PM generator rotates at slow variable speed and is subjected to varying load like a real WT does. Considering the electric subassemblies and rotor blades of direct drive WTs are most vulnerable to damage in practice, rotor unbalance and generator winding faults were emulated on the test rig. Experimental results show that the proposed CM technique is effective in detecting both types of faults occurring in the drive train of direct drive PM WTs. In summary, the proposed CM technique can be identified by (i) the CM is accomplished through analyzing the generator electrical signals without resorting to any other information (e. g. vibro-acoustic). Hence, the data acquisition work will be eased off; (ii) no more transducer other than current and voltage sensors are required. Thus, the cost of the CMS will be significantly reduced; (iii) attributed to the distinguished superiorities of THT to traditional spectral analyses in processing nonlinear signals, the proposed technique is more reliable in interpreting WT CM signals; and (iv) the CM criterion IV has a simple computational algorithm. It is therefore suited to both online and offline WT CM applications.

AB A wind turbine with a horizontal rotation axis is considered in the stationary airflow. A problem of choosing the law of change of the setting angle of the cross section of the wind turbine blade and the value of the angular speed so that the wind energy utilization coefficient is maximal is discussed. Maximization of the respective functional is considered as a variational problem with a priori unknown parameter. Once it is solved numerically or analytically, the optimal value of this parameter is determined, with the sought variables given by rather simple formulas. The results are analyzed on a qualitative level. In particular, the setting angle is found to change monotonically along the blade, which is confirmed by practical wind turbine design. Examples of using the proposed approach to wind turbine blade design are considered.

ID EXTENDED SELF-SIMILARITY; SPEED; TURBULENCE; FLUCTUATIONS; TURBINES
AB We present a new stochastic approach to describe and remodel the conversion process of a wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. The method is trained on data measured on one onshore wind farm for an equivalent time period of 55 days. Three global variables are defined for the wind farm: the 1-Hz wind speed u(t) and 10-min average direction (phi) over bar both averaged over all wind turbines, as well as the cumulative 1-Hz power output P(t). When conditioning on various wind direction sectors, the dynamics of the conversion process u(t) -> P(t) appear as a fluctuating trajectory around an average IEC-like power curve. Our approach is to consider the wind farm as a dynamical system that can be described as a stochastic drift/diffusion model, where a drift coefficient describes the attraction towards the power curve and a diffusion coefficient quantifies additional turbulent fluctuations. These stochastic coefficients are inserted into a Langevin equation that, once properly adapted to our particular system, models a synthetic signal of power output for any given wind speed/direction signals. When combined with a pre-model for turbulent wind fluctuations, the stochastic approach models the power output of the wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1Hz using only 10-min average values of wind speed and directions. The stochastic signals generated are compared to the measured signal, and show a good statistical agreement, including a proper reproduction of the intermittent, gusty features measured. In parallel, a second application for performance monitoring is introduced. The drift coefficient can be used as a sensitive measure of the global wind farm performance. When monitoring the wind farm as a whole, the drift coefficient registers some significant deviation from normal operation if one of twelve wind turbines is shut down during less than 4% of the time. Also, intermittent anomalies can be detected more rapidly than when using 10-min averaging methods. Finally, a probabilistic description of the conversion process is proposed and modeled, which can in turn be used to further improve the estimation of the stochastic coefficients.

SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

ID UNCERTAIN FREQUENCY; GENERATOR
AB In this paper, an adaptive internal model based controller is presented for suppressing the tower vibrations in variable speed wind turbines. Wind turbines have a dedicated current and power control module for the second operation region of the machine, where the machine works below the rated wind speed, and a pitch controller for the third operation region of the machine, where the machine works above the rated wind speed. The current and power controllers are designed to maximize the captured power below the rated wind speed, whereas the pitch controller is designed to limit the rotation speed and generated power above the rated wind speed. The pitch controller can further be used to suppress the mechanical tower vibration. Since the vibration frequencies of a tower are not exactly specified in the real turbines, the proposed method, which is based on the behavior of an internal model in an error feedback system, utilizes an algorithm to identify the vibration frequency followed by cancelling the vibration signal. Four different software packages including FAST, TurbSim, AeroDyn, and Simulink are integrated and used for simulation studies. Furthermore, performance of the controller is investigated in normal and fault ride through conditions. The results indicate accurate and proper performance of the controller in terms of identification of the tower vibration frequency and its suppression. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB The generator torque control loop of a multi-MW wind turbine consists of three operational regions, i.e. a max Cp region, a transient region around the rated rotor speed, and a power regulation region. The performance and mechanical stress on the wind turbine structure are closely related with how the torque schedule is mechanized in the transient and above-rated regions. Using a drive train model, the closed loop dynamic characteristics for different torque schedules were analyzed. It is found that the slope of the torque for the rotor speed in the transient region is the major factor which determines the performance and mechanical loading of the wind turbine. The effect of using a variable torque instead of the fixed rated torque in the above-rated region is also analyzed.

ID TRANSMISSION
AB In the pursuit of making wind energy technology more economically attractive, fluid power technology for the transmission of wind energy is being developed by several parties all over the world. This study presents a dynamic model of a fluid power transmission for the variable speed wind turbines and shows a parametric study on the dynamic behaviour below the rated wind speed. A pressure control strategy is proposed to achieve a variable speed operation of the rotor while using a fixed speed generator. The rotor of a five megawatt reference turbine is used to perform the time domain simulations. Different values of the hydraulic line length and transmission efficiency are considered for the same wind conditions and the results are compared with the response of the reference gearbox drive train. The results show that the amount of oil in the hydraulic drivetrain has an important influence on the first natural frequency of the transmission and the pipeline dynamics become more relevant for the longer transmission lines. Lowering the volumetric efficiency of the hydraulic motor leads to an additional damping of the pressure fluctuation, however, its influence is minor and unlikely to be advantageous when compared with the power loss.

AB The brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG) has been proposed as a viable alternative in wind turbines to the commonly used doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The BDFIG retains the benefits of the DFIG, i.e. variable speed operation with a partially rated converter, but without the use of brush gear and slip rings, thereby conferring enhanced reliability.
   As low voltage ride-through (LVRT) performance of the DFIG-based wind turbine is well understood, this paper aims to analyze LVRT behavior of the BDFIG-based wind turbine in a similar way. In order to achieve this goal, the equivalence between their two-axis model parameters is investigated. The variation of flux linkages, back-EMFs and currents of both types of generator are elaborated during three phase voltage dips. Moreover, the structural differences between the two generators, which lead to different equivalent parameters and hence different LVRT capabilities, are investigated.
   The analytical results are verified via time-domain simulations for medium size wind turbine generators as well as experimental results of a voltage dip on a prototype 250 kVA BDFIG. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wind speed knowledge is prerequisite in the siting of wind turbines. In consequence the wind energy use requires meticulous and specified knowledge of the wind characteristics at a location.
   This paper presents a method for determining the annual average wind speed at a complex terrain site by using neural networks, when only short term data are available for that site. This information is useful for preliminary calculations of the wind resource at a remote area having only a short time period of wind measurements measurement in a site. Artificial neural networks are useful for implementing non-linear process variables over time, and therefore are a useful tool for estimating the wind speed. The neural network used is multilayer perceptron with three layers and the supervised learning algorithm used is backpropagation. The inputs used in the neural network were wind speed and direction data from a single station, and the training patterns used correspond to sixty days data. The results obtained by simulating. the annual average wind speed at the selected site based on data from nearby stations with correlation coefficients above 0.5 were satisfactory, compared with actual values. Reliable estimations were obtained, with errors below 6%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wind power has become one of the most prominent renewable energy applications in the power industry. Its annual installation is continuously setting a record high. Due to the large portion of generation mix within the system, it is desirable to operate wind power under the automatic generation control (AGC). This issue also raises another concern on the modeling of wind farms under AGC. The traditional way of portraying wind farm production in simulation is to use an aggregated wind turbine model that is generally operated in maximum power point tracking (MPPT). This approach is not suitable for wind's participation in AGC. Therefore, more studies should be done to investigate how the individual wind turbines affect the wind farm performance under the set-point operation. This paper first illustrates the controllability of wind turbines under the set-point control. Following that, a comprehensive guidance of wind generator modeling is demonstrated to yield different approaches for developing the wind farm model. Two types of wind farm models are derived and demonstrated to portray the capability of set-point tracking under the intermittent wind condition. Associated simulations are presented and compared to show the different characteristics of these two wind farm models in depicting the set-point operation under AGC.

AB Designing an efficient and effective maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method is a vital yet challenging task for modern large-scale variable speed wind power systems. In this paper, an improved control and extremum seeking strategy is proposed to construct a novel MPPT scheme, and the merit of this scheme is twofold. On the one hand, a nonlinear speed tracking controller is developed on the basis of the dynamic model of wind turbines, which cannot only track a desired rotor speed trajectory but also provide the extremum seeking module with estimation of the varying rotor torque. On the other hand, an extremum seeking module blended with lookup-table module is designed on the basis of a novel hill climbing searching method, which is more efficient because of its online updating structure and independence of the measurement of wind speed and output power. For simulation validation, a 10-MW direct driven wind turbine is used as a benchmark to test the proposed strategy. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID CVT
AB Traditional transmission in a vehicle has low efficiency and that in a wind turbine has a constant output-to-input speed ratio, which needs a power converter to regulate the current frequency that can be fed into the grid. Different types of continuously variable transmission (CVT) have been developed for vehicle and wind turbine applications, which allow optimal engine speeds to be selected for different driving conditions in the former and can generate constant-frequency current without using a power converter in the latter. An infinitely variable speed converter (IVSC) is a specific type of CVT that can achieve a zero speed ratio and transmit a large torque at a low speed ratio. An IVSC with drivers that convert an eccentric motion of cams to a concentric motion of the output shaft through one-way bearings is introduced, and an active control system with a combined feedback and feed-forward control that can automatically adjust the eccentricity of outer cams to control the speed ratio of the transmission is developed. The kinematic model of the IVSC is derived and fitted by a polynomial function to serve as the feed-forward function in the control law. The feedback control is used to reduce the system error. A dynamic model of the IVSC is derived to investigate the effect of the dynamic load on the input and output speeds. Static and dynamic tests were conducted to validate the kinematic model of the IVSC. The variation of the average output speed per revolution of the output shaft is 0.56% with respect to the desired output speed in the simulation and 0.91% in the experiments.

AB This paper studies the drivetrain dynamics of a 750kW spar-type floating wind turbine (FWT). The drivetrain studied is a high-speed generator, one-stage planetary, two-stage parallel and three-point support type. The response analysis is carried out in two steps. First, global aero-hydro-elastic-servo time-domain analyses are performed using HAWC2. The main shaft loads, which include the axial forces, shear forces and bending moments, are obtained in this integrated wind-wave response analysis. These loads are then used as inputs for the multi-body drivetrain time-domain analyses in SIMPACK. The investigations are largely based on comparisons of the main shaft loads and internal drivetrain responses from 1h simulations. The tooth contact forces, bearing loads and gear deflections are the internal drivetrain response variables studied. The comparisons are based on the mean values, standard deviations and maximum values extrapolated using a 10(-5) up-crossing rate. Both operational and parked conditions are considered. The investigation consists of three parts. First, the responses are compared between the FWT and its equivalent land-based version. Second, the contributions from the main shaft loads (shear forces, axial forces and bending moments) and nacelle motions are investigated individually. Third, an improved four-point support (4PT) system is studied and compared against the original three-point support system for the FWT. The results show that there are general increases in the standard deviations of the main shaft loads and internal drivetrain responses in the FWT. In addition, these increases are a result of the increased main shaft loads in the FWT, especially the non-torque loads. Last, the 4PT system, when applied to a FWT drivetrain, significantly reduces the tooth contact forces and bearing loads in the low-speed stage, but this result comes at the expense of increased main bearing radial loads.

AB The main objectives of this study were to aerodynamically design and optimize a winglet for a wind turbine blade by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and to investigate its effect on the power production. For validation and as a baseline rotor, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Phase VI wind turbine rotor blade is used. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and k-epsilon Launder-Sharma turbulence model was used. The numerical results have shown a considerable agreement with the experimental data. The genetic algorithm was used as the optimization technique with the help of artificial neural network to reduce the computational cost. In the winglet design, the variable parameters are the cant and twist angles of the winglet and the objective function the torque. Multipoint optimization is carried out for three different operating wind speeds, and a total of 24 CFD cases are run in the design. The final optimized winglet showed around 9% increase in the power production. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wind is one of the most compelling forms of indirect solar energy. Available now, the conversion of wind power into electricity is and will continue to be an important element of energy self-sufficiency planning. This paper is one in a series intended to report on the development of a new type of generator for wind energy; a compact, high-power, direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (DD-PMSG) that uses direct liquid cooling (LC) of the stator windings to manage Joule heating losses. The main parameters of the subject LC DD-PMSG are 8 MW, 3.3 kV, and 11 Hz. The stator winding is cooled directly by deionized water, which flows through the continuous hollow conductor of each stator tooth-coil winding. The design of the machine is to a large degree subordinate to the use of these solid-copper tooth-coils. Both steady-state and time-dependent temperature distributions for LC DD-PMSG were examined with calculations based on a lumped-parameter thermal model, which makes it possible to account for uneven heat loss distribution in the stator conductors and the conductor cooling system. Transient calculations reveal the copper winding temperature distribution for an example duty cycle during variable-speed wind turbine operation. The cooling performance of the liquid cooled tooth-coil design was predicted via finite element analysis. An instrumented cooling loop featuring a pair of LC tooth-coils embedded in a lamination stack was built and laboratory tested to verify the analytical model. Predicted and measured results were in agreement, confirming the predicted satisfactory operation of the LC DD-PMSG cooling technology approach as a whole. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays the use of renewable energy including wind energy has risen dramatically. Because of the increasing development of wind power production, improvement of the prediction of wind turbine output energy using classical or intelligent methods is necessary. To optimize the power produced in a wind turbine, speed of the turbine should vary with wind speed. Variable speed operation of wind turbines presents certain advantages over constant speed operation. This paper has investigated power-split hydrostatic continuously variable transmission (CVT). The objective of this article was to capture maximum energy from the wind by prediction the optimal values of the wind turbine reaction torque. To build an effective prediction model, the polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) are applied as the kernel function of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for prediction of wind turbine reaction torque in this research study. Instead of minimizing the observed training error, SVR poly and SVR_(rbf) attempt to minimize the generalization error bound so as to achieve generalized performance. The experimental results show that an improvement in predictive accuracy and capability of generalization can be achieved by our proposed approach. Results show that SVRs can serve as a promising alternative for existing prediction models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses a mathematical model for solving transmission network expansion management (TNEM) associated with reactive power management (RPM) in the presence of double-fed induction generator (DFIG) variable speed wind turbine and hybrid flow controller (HFC). According to this plan, the reactive power capability of DFIG wind turbine is gained and the constraints of deliverable power are derived for each operation point. Strong control capability of the HFC with controlling bus voltage and line power flow offers a great potential for solving many of the problems facing electric utilities. For a precise steady-state analysis of HFC, the injection model is considered which it is an adaptive model in steady-state analysis. The main goals of the proposed management strategy are to minimize investment cost, real power loss cost in transmission lines and voltage deviation and maximize voltage stability index and social benefit at the same time. A three-stage scheme has been developed for solving hybrid TNEM-RPM problem. In the beginning of the plan, it is assumed that all the reactive demands are acquired from local sources and an optimal transmission plan is specified. After transmission lines are constructed, in the second step, reactive power sources will be allocated to weak buses. In order to assess reliability of the system, EENS criterion is used. Due to multi-objective nature of the proposed management method, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (INSGA-II) style is applied for an optimization procedure. Also, a decision making method based on fuzzy decision making (FDM) is used for finding the best compromise solution from the set of Pareto-solution obtained by INSGA-II technique. In a real power system, Azarbaijan regional power system of Iran, comparative analysis of the results obtained from previous management methods and the proposed approach is represented.

AB Hydropower is a major energy source among the renewable energy sources. According to "BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2013", 16.34 percentage of global power generation acquire from hydropower. To attain efficient generation in hydro plant, extensive design with the up to date technology is mandatory. To make the generation more effective various technologies are adopted, among these the very effective one is power electronics (PE) technology. The paper has reviewed the challenges in how PE technology fits in as the solution for various hydroelectric energy systems (HEES). The PE technology is adapted efficiently in various parts of HEES like, grid integration, machine control, switching (pumping mode to generating mode and vice versa), power control, voltage and frequency control, power factor correction, etc., The advancement of PE diminishes the cost and space of the plant and enhances the power handling capability. The paper emergence the outstanding features of power electronics in various aspects that will extensively contribute to the development of HEES around the world. In addition, PE contribution satisfies the need of reliability, dynamic response, efficiency, protection, etc., in HEES. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a direct control strategy for an interior permanent magnet synchronous generator-based variable speed wind turbine. In this scheme, the requirement of the continuous rotor position is eliminated as all the calculations are done in the stator reference frame. This scheme possesses advantages such as lesser parameter dependence and reduced number of controllers compared with the traditional indirect vector control scheme. The direct control scheme is simpler and can eliminate some of the drawbacks of traditional indirect vector control scheme. The proposed control scheme is implemented in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems and the results show that the controller can operate under constant and varying wind speeds. Finally, a sensorless speed estimator is implemented, which enables the wind turbine to operate without the mechanical speed sensor. The simulation and experimental results for the sensorless speed estimator are presented.

AB Conventional wind power plants employ a variable speed gearbox to run a generator housed on top of a tower. A new topology can remove some of the weight from the tower and centralize the wind power generation. This new topology uses a hydraulic wind power transfer system to connect several wind turbines to the generation unit. This paper demonstrates a mathematical modeling of this wind power transfer technology and its dynamic behavior. The flow response, angular velocity, and pressure of the system obtained from the mathematical model are compared with test results to demonstrate the accuracy of the mathematical model. Several speed-step responses of the system obtained from the mathematical model demonstrate a close agreement with the results from the prototype of the hydraulic wind power transfer unit.

This controller generates the direct-and quadrature-axis rotor voltage signals from both the stator current and voltage that are measured by the Hall sensors. The input variables of the control system are the rotor speed, the active and reactive power references, and their respective errors. The proposed control strategy allows the converter connected to the rotor terminals to operate with constant switching frequency. Digital simulation and experimental tests are performed for a 2.25-kW doubly fed induction generator to validate the proposed control strategy.

AB In this paper, a comparative study between voltage oriented control (VOC) and frequency coordinated control (FCC) of grid connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is presented. The two method controls are deeply done on DFIG converter sides, grid side converter (GSC), and rotor side converter (RSC). The VOC method permanently maintains the DFIG reactive power to zero values to achieve stable voltage. This control is implemented by regulating the rotor direct axis reference current in RSC using grid reactive power. On the other hand, the FCC has employed the active power obtaining from the system frequency deviation to control the rotor quadrature axis reference current in the RSC. The GSC is the same in two studies, and its applied vector controlled method. The comparison study between the two methods is conducted at a steady and dynamic state under constant and variable wind speeds. The simulation results are carried out by using PSCAD/EMTDC electromagnetic transient program to validate the comparison study between two methods control of DFIG. The outcomes of the simulation show that the VOC is very convenient when the DFIG operated at transient mode and variable wind speeds while the FCC is feasible and effective for steady-state mode applications. Furthermore, the FCC method has an ability to reduce the active and reactive powers ripples as well as decreasing torque harmonics. Both of two methods had fewer transient recovery values of output parameters, which ensure safety dynamic response of DFIG and power system. This study contributes significantly to choose the suitable control of the DFIG converters according to electrical grid operation conditions. In addition, if a joint control has been applied to these two methods, the wind power gained strong and flexible control of the frequency and voltage for different operating conditions.

AB This study presents a simple voltage oriented vector control scheme to regulate active and reactive power in a grid connected variable speed wind electrical system that consists of permanent magnet synchronous generator and matrix converter, which enables the maximum power tracking in wind electrical systems. The maximum extractable power from wind is derived from power curves and set as reference active power. Reactive power reference is chosen as zero. The deviations in powers are processed by proportional and integral (PI) controllers which vary the voltage gain of MC through which the desired regulation of powers is carried out. Since the relationship between wind speed and reference active power is nonlinear, single PI controller is insufficient, hence gain scheduling is required to adjust the controller parameters in response to changes in wind speeds. The controller parameter change is abrupt in conventional gain scheduling which leads to unstable performance. To avoid this, neural network-based PI (NN-PI) is designed which is more robust. In the presented work, both conventional gain scheduled PI and NN-PI are applied to validate the suggested voltage oriented control for power regulation. Simulation and experimental studies are presented to confirm the effective functionality of the system.

AB This study presents an optimal control strategy for the electronic interface of a wind energy conversion system based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). A linear optimal control is used on the grid side of the interface to ensure a proper power transfer and a linear parameter-varying (LPV) control on the machine side to cope with the wide operating conditions demanded by the wind turbine applications. The dynamics of a PMSG working in a variable speed wind turbine is affected by the rotational speed of the wind rotor. The LPV control uses the generator speed as a scheduling variable to adapt itself to different operating conditions. The proposed scheme results in a multi-variable self-scheduled controller with a PI structure similar to classical approaches. Thus, the control ensures performance and stability in all possible operating conditions whereas the implementation and the numerical stability are similar to previous schemes. The proposed control has been implemented in a test bench that includes a fully-rated back-to-back converter. The experimental results show a good performance in different scenarios in which the controller has to adapt itself to highly varying operating conditions.
