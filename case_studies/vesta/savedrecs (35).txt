AB The efficiency of the wind power conversions systems can be greatly improved using an appropriate control algorithm. In this work, a robust control for variable speed wind power generation that incorporates a doubly feed induction generator is described. In the presented design it is applied the so called vector control theory. The proposed control scheme uses stator flux-oriented control for the rotor side converter bridge control and grid voltage vector control for the grid side converter bridge control. The proposed robust control law is based on a sliding mode control theory, that, as it is well known, presents a good performance under system uncertainties.
   The stability analysis of the proposed controller under disturbances and parameter uncertainties is provided using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally simulated results show, on the one hand that the proposed controller provides high-performance dynamic characteristics, and on the other hand that this scheme is robust with respect to the uncertainties that usually appear in the real systems.

Previous work on the power converter is described, followed by the design parameters of the permanent magnet synchronous generator developed for wind turbines in the 10 kW range. The power electronic converter consisting of the Active Front End controlling the DC link voltage and Motion Control inverter controlling the generator, is modelled using SimPowerSystems. The configuration of the simulation model is similar to the real converter and generator. Simulation results for grid connection of the permanent magnet synchronous generator are presented followed by some conclusions.

AB Split drivetrain configurations with multiple generators are one of the solutions for increasing the reliability and reducing the cost of wind turbines. The split drivetrain technology gives the ability to introduce multiple generators and by that reduces the gear size and facilitate variable-speed operation. This paper proposes a double input AC/AC nine-switch converter for direct conversion of low-frequency AC from the generators to high-frequency AC square wave for input to a high frequency transformer used for isolation purposes. The high frequency transformer in connection with a diode rectifier will give a high voltage DC output. With the nine-switch topology a pair of generators can then share one converter and thus reduce the cost of the power electronics. Performance and operation are explained and illustrated in this paper through simulations.

In the present work it will be analyzed how a change in the wind speed affects the power delivered from the generator by means of two approaches: firstly, the component-oriented model of the VSWT-based PMSG is given, i.e. the dynamic equations of the system are shown, and then, it is discussed how to obtain an equivalent transfer function of the whole system. A comparison between both approaches is discussed in this work.

AB Direct Torque Control (DTC) and Field Oriented Control (FOC) are the most dominant control strategies used in generators for wind turbines. In this paper both control methods were implemented on a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). The variable speed wind turbine with full scale power converter topology was chosen for design. Parameters from a 2 MW wind turbine were used for system modeling. All the components of the wind turbine system (WTS), except the DC-link and the grid site converter were implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The pitch controller was used to limit the output power produced by the turbine. DTC and FOC strategies, using SVM were used to control the generator rotor speed. The performance of the two control strategies were compared after different tests have been carried out.

AB This paper presents a new method of using coordinated control and short term wind speed prediction to smooth the output of an array of wind turbines. The proposed controller uses knowledge of the kinetic energy storage potential in the rotor disc to allow production of piecewise static power outputs from variable wind inputs. Previous studies have shown that there are large peaks in wind power variability in the minutes timescale which is within the ability of a control system to reduce. This variation will cause issues with balancing systems within the local grid, as such it is beneficial to remove it. Results of tests to the system are presented which show a significant reduction in wind farm output power variability without a significant drop in output power.

AB The paper proposes a Fuzzy logic approach for controlling three-level NPC converters in stand alone wind energy systems. A key function of this controller is to maintain constant voltage and frequency for customers while maintaining smooth voltage waveform with less filtering requirements. The principle of the proposed Fuzzy controller is based on a modified PI approach in which the error and its integral are utilized as an input for the controller. The direct and quadrature components are used as control variables for the controller. Due to the integrity of the wind energy systems, a complete system is developed including machine-side converter controller and power balancing controller. The entire system is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and tested on several load and wind conditions. A real wind speed measurements were imposed to the wind turbine in the system to ensure some realistic responses of the system.

AB A DFIG wind turbine is a variable-speed wind turbine widely used in modern wind power industry. The maximum power extraction of the turbine is affected by 1) electrical characteristics of the generator, 2) aerodynamic characteristics of the turbine blades, and 3) maximum power extraction control strategies. This paper presents a DFIG maximum power extraction study through integrated steady-state characteristic and transient close-loop control evaluation approach. The generator characteristics are examined for different d-q control conditions; the peak power tracking and extracted wind power characteristics are presented versus generator slip. Then, all the three characteristics are analyzed in a joint environment to investigate the lookup-table maximum power extraction principle. A nested current- and speed-loop control structure is developed using the stator-voltage-oriented frame, which is then used to evaluate factors that may affect the DFIG peak power tracking control performance. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate how the maximum power extraction is influenced by wind turbine electrical and aerodynamic characteristics as well as different sampling rate and low-pass filtering strategies.

AB Oscillation damping via variable speed wind generators have been addressed in literature. Among the techniques, active power modulation has been studied. However, active power is closely related with electromagnetic torque. Modulating active power can introduce oscillations in the torque. This is undesired. The objective of this paper is to study an alternative technique - reactive power modulation for inter-area oscillation damping. A two-area four-machine power system with doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. Vector control for rotor-side converter (RSC) of DFIG is modeled. A control scheme based on reactive power modulation for inter-area oscillation damping is proposed. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the effectiveness of the control technique.

AB Cost-effective wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring assumes more importance as turbine sizes increase and they are placed in more remote locations, for example, offshore. Conventional condition monitoring techniques, such as vibration, lubrication oil, and generator current signal analysis, require the deployment of a variety of sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. This paper describes a WT condition monitoring technique that uses the generator output power and rotational speed to derive a fault detection signal. The detection algorithm uses a continuous-wavelet-transform-based adaptive filter to track the energy in the prescribed time-varying fault-related frequency bands in the power signal. The central frequency of the filter is controlled by the generator speed, and the filter bandwidth is adapted to the speed fluctuation. Using this technique, fault features can be extracted, with low calculation times, from director indirect-drive fixed-or variable-speed WTs. The proposed technique has been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test rig. A synchronous or induction generator was successively installed on the test rig, and both mechanical and electrical fault-like perturbations were successfully detected when applied to the test rig.

The control strategy for the generator-side converter with maximum power extraction is presented. The stand-alone control is featured with output voltage and frequency controller that is capable of handling variable load. The potential excess of power is dissipated in the dump-load resistor with the chopper control, and the dc-link voltage is maintained. Dynamic representation of dc bus and small-signal analysis are presented. Simulation results show that the controllers can extract maximum power and regulate the voltage and frequency under varying wind and load conditions. The controller shows very good dynamic and steady-state performance.

AB Variable speed operation of wind turbines is conducted by torque control below rated wind speed. Variable speed wind turbines could lead to extract maximum power, which is the main objective of torque control, from the potential aerodynamic power of the wind. Torque control methods of wind turbines are classified into two cases; torque mode control and speed mode control. In this paper, simulation results applying two torque control methods in the optimal region are presented for a multi-MW wind turbine and response properties of each method are compared.

AB Recently, the size of wind turbines is increased. As a result, the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) plays an important role because of its simple structure and high efficiency. This paper proposes a torque and pitch control scheme for variable speed wind turbines. A torque controller is designed to maximize the output power below the rated wind speed and a pitch controller is designed to regulate above the rated wind speed. The controllers exploit sliding mode control scheme considering the rapid variation of wind speed. Since the aerodynamic torque and rotor acceleration are difficult to measure in practice, an observer is designed which estimate them. In order to verify the proposed control strategy, we provide stability analysis and present simulation results.

AB Split drivetrain configurations with multiple generators are one of the solutions for increasing the reliability and reducing the cost of wind turbines. The split drivetrain technology gives the ability to introduce multiple generators and by that reduces the gear size and facilitates variable-speed operation. This paper proposes a double input AC/AC nine-switch converter for direct conversion of low-frequency AC from the generators to high-frequency AC square wave for input to a high frequency transformer used for isolation purposes. The high frequency transformer in connection with a diode rectifier will give a high voltage DC output. With the nine-switch topology a pair of generators can then share one converter and thus reduce the cost of the power electronics. Performance and operation are explained and illustrated in this paper through simulations.

The rotational speed of the induction generator is estimated with the Model Reference Adaptive System - MRAS observer. The estimated rotational speed is used as the feedback of the control loop in the converter control system. Proportional integral controller in the MRAS observer is optimized via Genetic Algorithm, Partical Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing. Comparative analise of the optimal speed estimation of induction generator is also presented. The performance of the sensorless controled variable speed wind turbine drive is evaluated through simulation in Matlab/Simulink.

AB This paper presents two different variable-speed control strategies to obtain the maximum power from wind turbines (WT). The two control strategies are composed by three regulators, which may be based on linear or nonlinear controllers. The first control strategy is composed of three standard proportional-integral (PI) regulators. The PI controllers are tuned for a specific operation mode. However, since the system is nonlinear, for different operating conditions, the values of the PI parameters may not be optimal. The second control approach includes a nonlinear (fuzzy) controller to compensate for the nonlinearity of the WT, to achieve improved speed performance under different operating points. The proposed control strategy uses a fuzzy controller and two standard PIs. The results show that in most cases the fuzzy controller obtains superior performance to that of the standard PI-based solution.

AB Variable speed wind generation systems are more attractive than fixed-speed systems because of the more efficient energy production improved power quality, and improved dynamic performance during grid disturbances. In this sense, to implement maximum wind power extraction, most controller designs of the variable-speed wind turbine generators employ anemometers to measure wind speed in order to derive the desired optimal shaft speed for adjusting the generator speed. In this paper it is proposed a new Neural Network Based Wind Speed Estimator for a wind turbine control. The design uses an feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to implement a rotor speed estimator, and simulated results show that the proposed observer provides high-performance dynamic characteristics.

The main purpose is to supply 230 V/50 Hz domestic appliances through a single-phase inverter. The required power for the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed wind turbine and energy storage systems with an appropriate control method. The control method for obtaining maximum power characteristic of wind turbine (MPPT), monitoring voltage and battery state of charge (SOC) to ensure optimum charging conditions for LAB, are presented. Energy storage devices are required for power balance and power quality in stand alone wind energy systems. Simulations and experimental results validate the stability of the supply.

AB Energy storage devices and solutions are required for power quality and balance within wind systems. In the context of rapidly expanding of distributed energy sources, the wind energy converters are in the center of interest. In this case, the direct dependence of the power generation capability for a given wind speed represents a major problem of wind energy conversion with regard to large-scale network integration. This paper proposes an overall solution which consists of a wind plant with a Smart Storage Modular System (SSMS) where the wind source -as stochastic one- is coupled over a dc bus with three storage modules and a smart grid interface. The investigated system consists of fours modules: a) the stochastic module (variable wind turbine with PMSG and ac/dc + bust converters), b) the short term storage module (flywheel with power electronic converter), c) the medium/long term module (Vanadium Redox Flow Battery with power electronic converter) and d) the medium term module (Lead Acid Battery). All of modules are interfaced with the network and insulated loads by a grid interface module (power electronic converter, filter and transformer). To the related SSMS, are accomplished computer simulations. In order to validate them, laboratory tests are also presented.

AB The variable pitch wind turbine system is a higher-order, nonlinear, strong coupling, multivariable and time-variable system. The control system is an integrated control system. Above the rated wind speed, we use fuzzy control strategy about power feedback Through controlling the pitch angle,we can change the attack angle of the blades in order to absorb a steady wind energy, and achieve constant power output. The simulation results show that fuzzy control method is easy to obtain better performance such as anti-disturbance and rapidness.

ID WIND TURBINES
AB The use of the Doubly-fed Induction Generator (DFIG) in large wind turbines is growing rapidly. In order to investigate the dynamic response of a variable speed wind energy conversion system with DFIG connected to the power system during grid disturbance, a model has been developed. This model includes aerodynamics, the mechanical drive train, the induction generator as well as the control parts. The response of the system during grid disturbances is studied along with the reaction of the generator protection scheme (crow bar).

The considered regimes of turbine operation are: at maximum available aerodynamic power and at limited output electric power. The wind turbine system consist of synchronous generator (SG) connected to diode rectifier, DC chopper and load. Two different control methods are used: with predefined turbine characteristics and with fuzzy logic controller. The turbine controllers combine the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and limited power point tracking (LPPT) algorithms. The performance of the dynamic models and the control loops are tested under various wind conditions. The simulation results are shown. The results prove the strategy and models reliability.

AB The paper studies the performance of variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) configuration with non-inverting buck-boost converter. The wind turbine systems consist of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to diode rectifier, DC chopper and load. New control strategy, based on the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and limited power point tracking (LPPT) algorithms is used to improve the system operation. When necessary to limit the power injected to the grid, due to system operator demands, a control unit is implementing to switch between two regimes of wind turbine operation: at maximum power and at limited power. The MPP tracker is simple perturb and observation (P&O) controller in combination with two optimum wind turbines power/torque versus speed characteristics. Two control loops: inner feed forward current control loop and outer voltage control closed loop are applied for the non-inverting buck-boost converter. The performance of the dynamic models and the control loops is tested under various wind conditions. The simulation results are shown. The results prove the strategy and models reliability.

AB In order to maximize capture wind power, wind turbine generator needs to tune wind turbine speed according wind. It is difficult to obtain the better dynamic quality and robustness by conventional controller based on mathematic model due to uncertainty Of wind speed and wind direction. An integral variable structure fuzzy adaptive controller is proposed for variable speed wind power system with uncertain model parameters and force disturbances. The control scheme is based on variable structure controller with integral compensation. The uncertainties are approximated based on fuzzy theory. Furthermore, fuzzy adaptive method is applied to regulate the gain of switch control variable in order to eliminate the chattering phenomenon that is inherent to variable structure system. The stability of the proposed controller is proved using Lyapunov method. Simulation results indicate that the strong robustness and better tracking performance can be achieved.

AB Wind turbine construction is a challenging undertaking due to the need to lift heavy loads to high locations in conditions of high and variable wind speeds. These conditions create great risks to contractors during the turbine assembly process. This paper presents a simulation-based system to aid in the construction planning of wind turbines. The system is composed of three main components; 1) A wind speed forecasting module based on artificial neural networks, 2) A series of discrete event simulation models that act as a test bed for different turbine construction methods and resource utilizations, and 3) A rule-based system that relates prevalent wind speed to the impact on lifting activity durations. Actual wind speed data from the Zafarana wind farm in Egypt is used and turbine construction productivity and resource utilization is compared for two common turbine construction methods.

AB One of the primary challenges in diagnostic health monitoring and control of wind turbines is compensating for the variable nature of wind loads. Given the sometimes large variations in wind speed, direction, and other operational variables (like wind shear), this paper proposes a data-driven, online rotor model identification approach. A 2 m diameter horizontal axis wind turbine rotor is first tested using experimental modal analysis techniques. Through the use of the Complex Mode Indication Function, the dominant natural frequencies and mode shapes of dynamic response of the rotor are estimated (including repeated and pseudo-repeated roots). The free dynamic response properties of the stationary rotor are compared to the forced response of the operational rotor while it is being subjected to wind and rotordynamic loads. It is demonstrated that both narrowband (rotordynamic) and broadband (wind driven) responses are amplified near resonant frequencies of the rotor. Blade loads in the flap direction of the rotor are also estimated through matrix inversion for a simulated set of rotor blade input forces and for the operational loading state of the wind turbine in a steady state condition. The analytical estimates are shown to be accurate at frequencies for which the ordinary coherence functions are near unity. The loads in operation are shown to be largest at points mid-way along the span of the blade and on one of the three blades suggesting this method could be used for usage monitoring. Based on these results, it is proposed that a measurement of upstream wind velocity will provide enhanced models for diagnostics and control by providing a leading indicator of disturbances in the loads.

AB This study presents a self-optimizing robust control scheme for maximizing the power generation for a variable speed wind turbine with DFIG. The control system consists of two control loops. The outer loop is an Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) based generator torque regulation via the rotor power feedback. The ESC can search for the optimal generator torque to maximize the rotor power under variation of the power map. The inner loop is electrical control using PWM converters via vector control schemes. An H-infinity controller is synthesized for maximizing the conversion from the rotor power to grid power, with performance weight defined with the spectrum of the rotor power obtained by the ESC. Also, the controller is designed to be robust against the variations of some parameters for the DFIG system. The proposed control strategy is validated via simulation study based on the synergy of several software packages including the TurbSim and FAST developed by NREL, Simulink and SimPowerSystems.

AB For the usage in variable speed wind turbines, a novel transmission mechanism with steady-speed output is proposed in this study. The proposed mechanism, named as independently controllable transmission (ICT), can produce a required angular velocity at the output shaft, which is independently manipulated by a controller and does not depend on the angular velocity of the input shaft. By applying the ICT mechanism to the variable speed wind power systems, the turbine fluctuation can be overcome and a constant speed can be provided for the input shaft of the generator. The ICT mechanism is fundamentally composed of two sets of planetary gear trains and two sets of transmission-connecting members. Four prototypes of the ICT mechanisms are installed to experiment their kinematical characteristics and to demonstrate their feasibility of engineering application.

AB A doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is a variable speed induction machine. It is a standard, wound rotor induction machine with its stator windings directly connected to the grid and its rotor windings connected to the grid through a back-to-back AC/DC/AC PWM converter. The power generation of a DFIG includes power delivered from two paths, one from the stator to the grid and the other from the rotor, through the frequency converter, to the grid. The power production characteristics, therefore, depend not only on the induction machine but also on the two PWM converters as well as how they are controlled. This paper investigates power generation characteristics of a DFIG system through computer simulation. The specific features of the study are (1) a steady-state model of a DFIG system in d-q reference frame, (2) a simulation mechanism that reflects decoupled d-q control strategies, (3) power characteristic simulation for both generator and converter, and (4) an integrative study combining stator, rotor and converter together. An extensive analysis is conducted to examine integrated power generation characteristics of DFIG and its frequency converter under different wind and d-q control conditions so as to benefit the development of advanced DFIG control technology.

Performance characteristics of the wind system are defined for different wind speeds. It is found that at the highest 10 m/s wind excitation, the maximum turbine mechanical power from wind is about 0.30 W at 5.3 V., maximum output power of the generator is about 0.18 W and maximum electrical efficiency is about 7% at 4.27 V., wind turbine power coefficients C(p) are 12.53% under maximum turbine mechanical power, 12.06 % under maximum, electrical efficiency cases. Also mechanical frictional losses of system are considered and added to analysis. The wind kit is also operated with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) type electrolyser for hydrogen production. The outputs of generator, inputs of PEM electrolyser and its rate of hydrogen formation characteristic are measured and modelled separately. Overall system is defined in MATLAB/Simulink. Operating points of PEM electrolyser on wind system kit are predicted by modelling. Relative errors are about 1-4% for voltage, 0.6-3% for current at 5.7-10 m/s wind interval. The rate of hydrogen production of wind generator-PEM electrolyser system is analyzed with respect to input wind speeds. The rate of hydrogen formation of the system is 0.4 ml/min at 10 m/s wind speed. The system kit has small scale, low performance and inexpensive tools, but it can be used not only for education but also for research tests about similar systems. Approaches in the study can be applied to systems with larger and special devices to carry out their performance tests.

AB In this study, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is designed for output voltage and frequency control of a variable-speed wind power generation system. Variable-speed wind power generation systems (VSWPGS) provide the opportunity to capture more power than fixed speed turbines. On the other hand, the variable-speed wind turbine output can be variable voltage and variable frequency for fluctuating wind speeds. The quality of output power can be improved if adequate controls are incorporated in the system. To bring the output voltage and frequency of system by means of control of blade pitch angle of wind turbine to a desirable value, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used in this paper. Based on the dynamic performance of VSWPGS, ANFIS is designed. Control and dynamic performance analysis of VSWPGS is made depending on various loading situations. Dynamic modeling, control and simulation study of the wind power generation system is performed with MATLAB/Simulink program. The simulation results obtained through various load, situations and detailed analysis of so established simulation model is given in this study. As it can be seen in simulation results, the output voltage and frequency of ANFIS controlled variable-speed wind power generation system reach to desirable operation values in a very short time.

AB Electric power generation from wind is becoming a major contributing energy source in the power systems around the world. Modern variable-speed wind turbines (WTs) systems that process power through power-electronic systems (PESs) have found better acceptance and have captured most of the market share. PES technologies enhance the controllability of WTs substantially. The PES employed in the wind power generation (WPG) system can effectively face the challenges of grid connection requirements (GCRs). Computational intelligence (CI) techniques, such as fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural network (ANN), evolutionary computation (EC), etc. are recently proposed and utilized for the control of power electronics systems. Overall, the dynamic performance of a wind turbine system can be substantially improved by the intelligent control of the PESs that are used in WPG systems.
   In this chapter, a computational strategy directed more towards intelligent behavior is employed as a tool for fast, accurate, and efficient control of PES used in double fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind power generation. The conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller is replaced with a nonlinear adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based controller. The fundamental concepts of CI based techniques like ANN, fuzzy logic, hybrid methods, and evolutionary programming are briefly described. The design and procedure for selection of parameters and training of ANFIS are described. A unified architecture (UA) of the DFIG and its control strategies is also addressed. The performance of the conventional PI and ANFIS based controllers is compared using simulation results on a detailed power system test model having wind farms.

AB Control systems for variable-speed wind turbines (WTs) are continuously evolving toward innovative and more efficient solutions. Among the various techniques, fuzzy logic is gaining reputation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. In this chapter, after a review of fuzzy logic based control applied to wind energy conversion systems, a sensorless peak power tracking control for maximum wind energy extraction and a voltage control allowing compensation of voltage variations at the WT connection point are proposed. Both the controllers are based on fuzzy logic.
   Before that, a data-driven design methodology is introduced, in order to generate the "best" Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy model, for the maximum power exploitation from a variable-speed wind turbine. The performance of the variable speed wind systems employing a synchronous generator and a full scale converter endowed with the proposed fuzzy controllers are tested under some common operating conditions.

AB This paper proposes a variable-speed wind generation system using the boost converter. The proposed system has three speed control modes for the wind velocity. The control mode of low wind velocity regulates the armature current of the generator with the boost converter to control the speed of wind turbine. The control mode of middle wind velocity regulates the DC link voltage with the vector controlled inverter to control the speed of wind turbine. The control mode of high wind velocity regulates the pitch angle of the wind turbine with the pitch angle control system to control the speed of the wind turbine. The hybrid combination of three control modes extends the variable-speed range. The proposed system simplifies maintenance, improves reliability, and reduces the costs compared with the variable-speed wind generation system using a PWM converter.
   This paper describes the control strategy and modeling for a simulation of the proposed system using Simulink of Matlab. It also describes the control strategy and modeling of a variable-speed wind generation system using a PWM converter. The steady state and transient responses for wind velocity changes are simulated using Matlab Simulink. This paper verifies the fundamental performance of the system using a boost converter by discussing the simulation results of both systems. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Wind power is gaining serious consideration as an important source of electric power generation. The output power of a wind turbine generator is, however, dependent on the wind speed, which is uncertain, intermittent, and variable. It is therefore necessary to develop suitable wind power integration models to assess the load-carrying capability benefits of added wind power. The present paper discusses the concept of short-term wind speed probability distributions and unit commitment risk, and examines the peak load-carrying capability and increase in peak load-carrying capability due to added wind power. The effects of hourly changes in wind speed on the estimation of these benefits are illustrated by evaluating the operating situations at two different times of the day in two different seasons of the year.

The nature of transient instability in FSWT is not similar to synchronous generators in which the cause of instability is rotor angle instability. in this paper, the study of dynamic behavior includes modal and sensitivity analysis, dynamic behavior analysis under wind speed fluctuation, eigenvalue tracking, and using it to characterize the instability mode, and investigating possible outcomes of instability. The results of theoretical studies are verified by time domain simulations. It is found that the instability occurs due to the mechanical dynamics and the instability is closely related to increasing of generator slip. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION

DT Article
ID PERIODIC COEFFICIENTS; WIND TURBINES; SYSTEMS; STABILITY
AB Structures with isotropic bladed rotors can be modally analyzed by eigenvalue analysis of time-invariant Coleman transformed equations of motion related to the inertial frame or by Floquet analysis of the periodic equations of motion. The Coleman transformation is here shown to be a special case of the Lyapunov-Floquet (L-F) transformation which transforms system equations of structures with anisotropic bladed rotors into a time-invariant system using the transition matrix and Floquet eigenvectors as a basis. The L-F transformation is not unique, whereby eigensolutions of the time-invariant system are not directly related to the modal frequencies and mode shapes observed in the inertial frame. This modal frequency indeterminacy is resolved by requiring the periodic mode shapes from the L-F approach to be as similar as possible to the mode shapes from the Coleman approach. For an anisotropic rotor the Floquet analysis yields a periodic mode shape that contains harmonics of integer multiples of the rotor speed for inertial state variables. These harmonic components show up as resonance frequencies on the sides of the corresponding modal frequency in a computed frequency response function of a simple three-bladed turbine with an anisotropic rotor.

AB Motor current signature analysis is the reference method for the diagnosis of induction machines' rotor faults; however, in time-varying conditions, it fails as slip and speed vary, and, thus, sideband components are spread in a bandwidth that is proportional to the variation. Variable speed drive applications are common in the aerospace, appliance, railway, and automotive industries and also in electric generators for wind turbines. In this paper, a simple and effective method is presented that allows the diagnosis of rotor faults for induction machine drives in time-varying conditions. It is tailored to direct rotor flux field-oriented controlled drives, where the control system provides suitable signals that are exploited for the demodulation to a constant frequency of time-varying signatures related to the rotor faults. Simulations and experiments are reported to validate the proposed method on a critical speed transient.

AB The study considers aspects of scalar V/f control, vector control and direct torque (and flux) control (DTC) of the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM) as a promising cost-effective alternative to the existing technological solutions for applications with restricted variable speed capability such as large pumps and wind turbine generators. Apart from providing a comprehensive literature review and analysis of these control methods, the development and results of experimental veri. cation, of an angular velocity observer-based DTC scheme for sensorless speed control of the BDFRM which, unlike most of the other DTC-concept applications, can perform well down to zero supply frequency of the inverter-fed winding, have also been presented in the study.
