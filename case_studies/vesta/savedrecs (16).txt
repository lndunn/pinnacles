TI System Efficiency of a Tap Transformer Based Grid Connection Topology
   Applied on a Direct Driven Generator for Wind Power
SO SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL

ID TURBINE
AB Results from experiments on a tap transformer based grid connection system for a variable speed vertical axis wind turbine are presented. The tap transformer based system topology consists of a passive diode rectifier, DC-link, IGBT inverter, LCL-filter, and tap transformer. Full range variable speed operation is enabled by using the different step-up ratios of a tap transformer. Simulations using MATLAB/Simulink have been performed in order to study the behavior of the system. A full experimental set up of the system has been used in the laboratory study, where a clone of the on-site generator was driven by an induction motor and the system was connected to a resistive load to better evaluate the performance. Furthermore, the system is run and evaluated for realistic wind speeds and variable speed operation. For a more complete picture of the system performance, a case study using real site Weibull parameters is done, comparing different tap selection options. The results show high system efficiency at nominal power and an increase in overall power output for full tap operation in comparison with the base case, a standard transformer. In addition, the loss distribution at different wind speeds is shown, which highlights the dominant losses at low and high wind speeds. Finally, means for further increasing the overall system efficiency are proposed.

AB Wind energy is one of the extraordinary sources of renewable energy due to its clean character and free availability. With the increasing wind power penetration, the wind farms are directly influencing the power systems. The majority of wind farms are using variable speed wind turbines equipped with doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) due to their advantages over other wind turbine generators (WTGs). Therefore, the analysis of wind power dynamics with the DFIG wind turbines has become a very important research issue, especially during transient faults. This paper presents fuzzy logic control of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine in a sample power system. Fuzzy logic controller is applied to rotor side converter for active power control and voltage regulation of wind turbine.

ID WIND TURBINE
AB OpenFoam is used to compare computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with blade element momentum theory (BEM) for a variable speed - variable pitch HAWT (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine). The wind turbine is first designed using the BEM to determine the blade chord, twist and operating conditions. The wind turbine blade has an outer diameter of 14 m, uses a NACA 63-415 profile for the entire blade and root to tip twist distribution of 15(deg) (Figure 3). The RPM varies from 20-75 for freestream velocities varying between 3-10.5 m/s (variable speed) and a constant RPM of 78.78 for velocities ranging between 11-25 m/s (variable pitch). OpenFOAM is used to investigate the wind turbine performance at several operating points including cut-in wind speed (3 m/s), rated wind speed (10.5 m/s) and in the variable pitch zone. Simulation results show that in the variable-speed operating range, both CFD and BEM compare reasonably well. This agreement can be attributed to the fact that the complex three-dimensional flow around the turbine blades can be split into two radial segments. For radii less than the mid-span, the flow is three-dimensional, whereas for radii greater than the mid-span, the flow is approximately two-dimensional. Since the majority of the power is produced from sections beyond the mid-span, the agreement between CFD and BEM is reasonable. For the variable-pitch operating range the CFD results and BEM deviate considerably. In this case the majority of the power is produced from the inner sections in which the flow is three-dimensional and can no longer be predicted by the BEM. The results show that differences in pitch angles up to 10(deg) can result to regulate the power for high wind speeds in the variable-pitch operation zone.

AB This paper presents a steady state analysis of the operation modes of the quasi-Z-source (qZS) derived push-pull DC/DC converter topology. It was derived by the combination of the qZS network and coupled inductors. The output stage of the converter consists of a diode bridge rectifier and an LC-filter. This topology provides a wide regulation range of the input voltage and galvanic isolation. These features fit the requirements for the integration systems of renewable energy sources, such as PV panels, variable speed wind turbines, and fuel cells. A converter can operate in continuous (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). Switching period is divided into four and six intervals for CCM and DCM, respectively. Equivalent circuits and analytical expressions for each interval are presented. The DC gain factor for each mode is derived. To simplify our analysis, coupled inductors were substituted with a model that consists of an ideal transformer and magnetizing inductance. Leakage inductances are neglected because the coupling coefficient in this topology should be close to unity. In DCM the converter operation depends on the active duty cycle and the duty cycle of the zero current condition. Two solutions are possible for the DC gain factor in DCM. It is theoretically impossible to achieve the unity DC gain factor in DCM if the turns ratio of coupled inductors is equal to or more than one. The proposed topology was simulated with PSIM software in two operating points. Experimental verification proves our theoretical and simulation results.

AB Purpose - Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is widely used in wind energy conversion systems and it can operate with other primary movers. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the standalone operation of DFIG which may expand the area of possible applications and increase capabilities of the generation system in terms of power quality.
   Design/methodology/approach - Synthesis of the control method was preceded by analysis of mathematical model of the machine. The control method based on the negative sequence and high harmonics extraction has been developed and verified in the laboratory unit. Control of the fundamental frequency component uses neither rotor speed nor position sensors.
   Findings - The original method allows to compensate negative sequence and high harmonics of the generated voltage. At the same time, due to the active filtering capability of the grid side converter, the stator phase current shape is close to sine wave. Thus, it is seen by the machine as a linear load, what eliminates the electromagnetic torque ripples.
   Practical implications - The system and control method can be applied in variable speed generation systems, e. g. wind turbines or diesel engines operating in the standalone mode.
   Originality/value - Although the selective compensation of negative sequence and harmonics are known in the literature, until now the methods have been verified for the system with a rotor position sensor. Moreover, the stator current feed-forward improving the transient properties, as well as results of transient states caused by the load step change, have not been proposed in publications.

AB In this paper, we propose a wind energy conversion system (WECS) at variable speed using a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) controlled on the rotor side through a cycloconverter. The dynamic behavior of the WECS, including the models of the wind turbine, the DFIG, the cycloconverter, and the power control of this system, is investigated. The power control of this system is applied to achieve the independent control of the active and reactive powers exchanged between the wind generator and the grid. In addition, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is included in the control system to capture the maximum power from the wind. Moreover, the cycloconverter with DFIG are used to test the possibility to operate in two quadrant modes (sub-synchronous and super-synchronous modes). The description of the proposed system is presented with the detailed dynamic modeling equations. The simulation results are presented, to demonstrate the performance and the efficiency of this system.

AB This paper considers the neural network controller design problem for variable pitch wind energy conversion systems (WECS) with non-Gaussian wind speed disturbances in the stochastic distribution control framework. The approach here is used to directly model the unknown control law based on a fixed neural network (the number of layers and nodes in a neural network is fixed) without the need to construct a separate model for the WECS. In order to characterize the randomness of the WECS, a generalized minimum entropy criterion is established to train connection weights of the neural network. For the train purpose, both kernel density estimation method and sliding window technique are adopted to estimate the PDF of tracking error and entropies. Due to the unknown process dynamics, the gradient of the objective function in a gradient-descent-type algorithm is estimated using an incremental perturbation method. The proposed approach is illustrated on a simulated WECS with non-Gaussian wind speed.

AB This paper presents an optimum design procedure for the coordinated tuning of machine side converter (MSC) and grid side converter (GSC) controllers of grid connected permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). Model based predictive controller (MBPC) is used to control the MSC. MBPC based speed control design consists of two steps. A linearized state space model is employed to predict the future output (rotor speed). An optimal control law is derived by minimizing a quadratic performance index that considers the control effort and the difference between the predicted rotor speed and the reference rotor speed. A proportional-integral (PI) controller is used to control the GSC. The MSC and GSC controller parameters are determined by simultaneously optimizing the controller performance indices. The coordinated controller design is carried out in two steps. The analytical expression that relates the performance indices and the controller parameters is arrived using response surface methodology (RSM). The determination of controller parameters is posed as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem and solved employing NSGA-II (non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II). The proposed methodology is tested on a sample power system with PMSG based WECS (Wind Energy Conversion System). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

AB In this paper, the performances of all the three kinds of Axial type Multi-Pole Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (PMSG) namely 'Three-phase', 'Multi-phase' or 'Five Phase' and 'Double Stator' fixed in Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) were investigated and compared in order to get an optimal system. `MATLAB/Simulink' had been used to model and simulate the wind turbine system together with all the three types Permanent Magnet Generators. It was observed from the result that with the increasing number of pole in both low and high wind speed, the five phase generator produced more power than the other two generators. In general, it was observed that the responses of the Multi-phase generator at both high and low speed wind showed promising aspect towards the system followed by Dual Stator. But with the change of the variables such as wind velocity, turbine height, radius, area together with the generator pole pairs and stator resistance, the optimum system should be chosen by considering the trade-off between different configurations which were firmly analyzed and described in this paper.

Below constant wind condition 8m/s, rotor power performance was investigated over variable turbine configurations. Illustrated by the simulation, increasing rotor cord to radius ratio or blade numbers will enhance the generation of vortexes and flow separation on blades, leading to the significant degradation of turbine performance. It can be conclude form the numerical analysis, a vertical axis wind turbine with high height to radius ratio applied in urban areas experienced better performance when operating in optimal tip speed ratio, with rotor cord to radius ratio between 0.2 and 0.4 and blade number of 3 or 4.

AB The variable speed wind turbine generator exhibits serious nonlinearity, uncertainty and difficulty accurate modeling, conventional HD controller can't achieve ideal control effect. In this paper, an adaptive inverse control scheme based on neural network identification technology is proposed to solve the above problem. The scheme firstly uses online identification of one DRNN to obtain the Jacobian information of plant. On this basis, another DRNN identifies the inverse plant model which constitutes adaptive inverse control system as controller. The simulation results verify that the adaptive inverse control scheme has excellent adaptability and robustness, which can make the actual rotational speed of wind turbine rapidly track the set point to maintain the best tip-speed ratio in order to get maximum wind energy capture in the random wind conditions.

AB This paper deals with an alternative design method of airfoil for wind turbine blade for low wind speed based on combination of smart computing and numerical optimization. In this work, a simulation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for determining the relation between airfoil geometry and its aerodynamic characteristics was conducted. First, several airfoil geometries were generated through transformation of complex variables (Joukowski transformation), and then lift and drag coefficients of each airfoil were determined using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). In present study, the ANN training was conducted using airfoil geometry and its aerodynamic characteristics as input and output, respectively. Therefore, lift and drag coefficients can be directly determined only by giving the airfoil geometry without having to perform wind tunnel experiment or numerical computation. Moreover, the optimization was conducted to obtain an airfoil geometry which gives maximum lift to drag ratio (C-L/C-D) for specific Reynolds number. For this purpose Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied as optimizer. The results were validated using commercial CFD and it can be shown that the result are satisfactory with error approximately of 6%.

A lab prototype of VAWT was built which was run at low wind speed of around 3 to 5 meter per second. The bearing was replaced by Neodymium Magnet to avoid the friction which in turns reduces the losses and increase the efficiency. A Prototype version of PMSG was built which could generate voltage from the turbine even in low rotational speed. Suitable turbine blade angle was also determined using trial and error method.

AB In this paper, the authors face the problem of wind speed processing as environmental variable of a wind turbine system. Generally, the information on wind speed measurements is processed over long periods of time to be relevant with respect to the site characteristics (average and maximum speeds, statistics). Subsequent large scale profiles of wind speed lead to long processing time for simulation analysis and especially for optimization design that penalises the search of optimal solutions. An original synthesis approach of a compact and representative wind speed profile using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is proposed. This approach is compared to a purely statistical approach based on random number generators. It allows reducing the actual wind profile duration with compression ratios greater (two months of wind speed measurements are compressed in only 1 h). Then, the synthesis approach by EA is applied to the sizing of an autonomous hybrid system based on wind turbine with battery storage for stand-alone energy systems. It has proven its effectiveness in reducing 200 days of wind speed measurements in only 10 days, allowing sizing the storage system with a significant gain in terms of computing time in the framework of the optimization process.

AB The doubly-fed Induction Generator (DFIG) wind turbine is the most widely used machine in variable speed wind mills. This necessitates the development of efficient control systems to improve the effectiveness of power generation. At present the commercial DFIG wind turbines mainly make use of the technology that was developed long back. It is found in many research papers that there is a limitation in the conventional vector control technique. This paper presents a new control technique for a DFIG wind turbine, using fuzzy logic. It can be implemented for the control of reactive power, real power, stabilization of DC-link voltage and reducing oscillations in electromagnetic torque. A MATLAB based simulation system is built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. This paper shows that with fuzzy control approach, a DFIG system has a superior performance in various aspects.

ID NONLINEAR CONTROL
AB As a result of the increase in energy demand and government subsidies, the usage of wind turbine system (WTS) has increased dramatically. Due to the higher energy production of a variable-speed WTS as compared to a fixed-speed WTS, the demand for this type of WTS has increased. In this study, a new method for the calculation of the power output of variable-speed WTSs is proposed. The proposed model is developed from the S-type curve used for population growth, and is only a function of the rated power and rated (nominal) wind speed. It has the advantage of enabling the user to calculate power output without using the rotor power coefficient. Additionally, by using the developed model, a mathematical method to calculate the value of rated wind speed in terms of turbine capacity factor and the scale parameter of the Weibull distribution for a given wind site is also proposed. Design optimization studies are performed by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms, which are applied into this type of problem for the first time. Different sites such as Northern and Mediterranean sites of Europe have been studied. Analyses for various parameters are also presented in order to evaluate the effect of rated wind speed on the design parameters and produced energy cost. Results show that proposed models are reliable and very useful for modeling and optimization of WTSs design by taking into account the wind potential of the region. Results also show that the PSO algorithm has better performance than the ABC algorithm for this type of problem.

Power Aeolian systems, due to high inertia moments and rapid variation in time of the wind speed cannot constantly function on the maximum power point. Therefore it must be considered the matter of determining the optimal functioning speed of the Aeolian device on the basis of evaluating the momentary wind speed in order to get maximum of electric power. The calculation is based upon an original mathematical model for the wind turbine-TV-and an experimental direct follow of the wind speed in time. Actually, it is presented the way of loading the generator according to the wind speed. etc.

AB Wind turbine condition monitoring is essential task in the process of maintaining machine operation at the optimal level. It is related to ensuring the profitability of investment and the provision of security in the environment of the turbine. However, operational conditions of turbine associated with non-stationary nature of the stimulus which is the wind, impede the correct diagnosis of the machine. In addition, a multitude of parameters adversely affects the clarity of predictions and setting alarm thresholds. In the article, the authors evaluate the impact of generator output power and rotational speed on selected vibration-based feature value. The study was performed for wind turbine planetary gearbox during fault development of the ring. It was possible due to historical data consisting peak-to-peak (P2P) values together with corresponding values of rotational speed and generator output power. For the purpose of the experiment the method that bases on calculation of arithmetic mean of the data in the segments corresponding to the chosen ranges of both rotational speed and generator output power is presented. Results are given in the form of three-dimensional charts, which allow assessing the impact of parameters on the studied feature. The paper shows that for machinery operating under varying regime proposed representation might serve as a valuable method for fault detection. Additionally, authors highlight the importance of analysis of vibration-based features as a function of two variables (rotational speed and power/load).

ID FLUCTUATION
AB The correct diagnosis of faulty components in rotating machines requires a pre-knowledge of the characteristics of the system being monitored and the identification of the frequencies of interest. In gearboxes, the number of gear stages and the number of teeth for each gear are required to calculate the gear mesh frequencies and monitor these frequencies and their sidebands. It is not always possible to have this information available, especially in old equipment. In this chapter a fresh approach is presented to deduce such crucial information from the measured vibration signal. The approach focuses on fine tuning harmonic/sideband cursors to capture different gear mesh families. The approach is illustrated on a signal taken from a wind turbine gearbox, which poses the extra challenge of the variable speed within the measurement record. Results show the possibility of identifying the number of teeth for the first two stages with much more confidence than the planetary stage, where a trial and error approach was used to decide on the most likely combination for the ring, sun and planetary gears. This chapter sets a good practice example for understanding the system characteristics by detailed analysis of the vibration signal using finely tuned harmonic and sideband cursors.

ID PITCH CONTROL
AB Offshore floating wind turbine (OFWT) has been a challenging research spot because of the high-quality wind power and complex load environment. This paper focuses on the research of variable torque control of offshore wind turbine on Spar floating platform. The control objective in below-rated wind speed region is to optimize the output power by tracking the optimal tip-speed ratio and ideal power curve. Aiming at the external disturbances and nonlinear uncertain dynamic systems of OFWT because of the proximity to load centers and strong wave coupling, this paper proposes an advanced radial basis function (RBF) neural network approach for torque control of OFWT system at speeds lower than rated wind speed. The robust RBF neural network weight adaptive rules are acquired based on the Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed control approach is tested and compared with the NREL baseline controller using the "NREL offshore 5 MW wind turbine" model mounted on a Spar floating platform run on FAST and Matlab/Simulink, operating in the below-rated wind speed condition. The simulation results show a better performance in tracking the optimal output power curve, therefore, completing the maximum wind energy utilization.

AB Influence of exogenous and endogenous factors on the exergy analysis of 3 Column array wind farm for two different layouts are highlighted in this paper. Nine turbines were placed in two different layouts to analyse the influence of exogenous factors such as wind velocity, wind direction, wind distribution and distance between turbines. Endogenous factors considered were diameter of rotor, hub height and number of blades. Models developed for energy and exergy efficiency estimation were tested using two different site data. Energy and exergy efficiency were found to be very sensitive to mean velocity and Weibull scale factor, which are site specific. Design wind speed, free stream wind speed and position of turbines in the wind farm contribute appreciably to the wind energy utilisation of the farm. A significant improvement in energy and exergy efficiency can be noticed with very small changes in wind direction for even complex positioning of turbines.

AB This paper proposes a new stochastic framework based on point estimate method to solve the optimal operation management of Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration (DFR) considering several Wind Turbines (WTs) in the system. The proposed method can properly solve the complex and discrete DFR optimization problem by the use of an adaptive modification approach based on firefly algorithm (FA). In addition, a new stochastic solution based on 2m Point Estimate Method (2m PEM) is proposed to handle the uncertainty associated with the problem random variables including the active and reactive loads as well as the wind speed variations effectively. The problem is then formulated in a multi-objective optimization structure including four significant targets: 1) active power losses, 2) bus voltage deviation, 3) total system costs and 4) total pollution produced. As a result of the conflicting behavior of the four objective functions, a fuzzy based clustering technique is employed to reach the set of optimal solutions called Pareto solutions. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method is examined on the IEEE 32-bus standard test system.

AB In recent years the use of renewable energy including wind energy has risen dramatically. Because of the increasing development of wind power production, improvement of the control of wind turbines using classical or intelligent methods is necessary. To optimize the power produced in a wind turbine, the speed of the turbine should vary with the wind speed. Variable-speed operation of wind turbines presents certain advantages over constant-speed operation. In this paper, in order to maintain the maximal output power of wind turbine, a novel intelligent controller based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is designed. To improve the wind energy available in an erratic wind speed regime, a wind generator equipped with continuously variable transmission (CVT) was proposed. In this model the ANFIS regulator adjusts the system speed, i.e. CVT ratio, for operating at the highest efficiency point. The performance of proposed controller is confirmed by simulation results. Some outstanding properties of this new controller are online implementation capability, structural simplicity and its robustness against any changes in wind speed and system parameter variations. Based on the simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed controllers was verified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work applies an enhanced levelized wind farm cost model, including landowner remittance fees, to determine optimal turbine placements under three landowner participation scenarios and two land-plot shapes. Instead of assuming a continuous piece of land is available for the wind farm construction, as in most layout optimizations, the problem formulation represents landowner participation scenarios as a binary string variable, along with the number of turbines. The cost parameters and model are a combination of models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Windustiy. The system-level cost-of-energy (COE) optimization model is also tested under two land-plot shapes: equally-sized square land plots and unequal rectangle land plots. The optimal COEs results are compared to actual COE data and found to be realistic. The results show that landowner remittances account for approximately 10% of farm operating costs across all cases. Irregular land-plot shapes are easily handled by the model. We find that larger land plots do not necessarily receive higher remittance fees. The model can help site developers identify the most crucial land plots for project success and the optimal positions of turbines, with realistic estimates of costs and profitability.

AB The reliability of wind turbine is of great importance for the availability and economical efficiency of wind power system. In this article, a reliability model for wind turbine is built with Bayesian network (BN), in which the influence of wind speed is considered. Causal logic method (CLM) is presented for qualitative modeling, which combines the merits of fault tree in handling technical aspects and the strength of BN in dealing with environmental factors and uncertainty. A novel adjustment method based on expectation is proposed for quantitative calculation, by which historical data and expert judgment are integrated to describe the uncertainty in the prior probability distributions. An approximate inference algorithm combining with dynamic discretization of continuous variables is adopted to obtain the reliability index of wind turbine and its elements. A case study is given to illustrate the proposed method, and the results indicate that wind speed is an important factor for the reliability of wind turbine.

AB This paper focuses on the design, thermal loading, and reliability of a three-level neutral-point-clamped back-to-back full-scale converter for a 10-MW direct-drive wind turbine equipped with a permanent-magnet synchronous generator. The reliability performance of the three-level converter is strongly influenced by the thermal behavior of the semiconductor devices and their mission profile which directly affects the lifetime and the cost of the entire converter. Therefore, a simulation platform is developed in a Matlab/Simulink and PLECS simulation environment to analyze the dynamics of the system using different kinds of modulation strategies and analyzing the different wind-load conditions that are dependent on roughness classes. This paper shows that the 60 degrees discontinuous pulsewidth-modulation strategies allow better thermal performance and increase the estimated lifetime of the converter. Furthermore, the increment of the wind roughness class causes a larger dispersion of the mean values and the variation of the junction temperatures, which also affect the lifetime of the converter. Hence, the cycle lifetime largely decreases considering the variable-wind-speed profile. In fact, the results show that the reliability of the converter is strongly affected by the temperature-cycle behavior and nonlinear factors of the mission profile such as turbulence, 3p effect, and gust.

AB This paper deals with the development of a simplified, control-oriented mathematical model of an offshore variable speed wind turbine with tension leg platform. First, the model is derived with the goal of describing the most relevant physical phenomena of the turbine/platform dynamics, while limiting its complexity. The unknown model parameters are identified and a model validation phase is carried out using Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence (FAST), an accurate reference model available in the literature. Then, an H-infinity controller is designed for above-rated power operating conditions. The ability of the controller to attenuate the effect of wind variations and waves is tested in simulation both on the small-scale simulation model and on the FAST simulator.

The joint probability distribution for the mean wind speed and wave height is considered in the study and the FAST code is used to simulate the wind conditions for various return periods. In the present study, the Environmental Contour (EC) method is used for long-term extreme response prediction, which uses inverse reliability techniques that work by searching a narrow subset of combinations of all important random variables that affect the performance of the floating wind turbine.

AB This study proposes a parameter estimation method, together with a grid synchronisation algorithm, for wind turbine-driven doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs). Aiming at achieving an automated control procedure, their integration with a previously published power control strategy is also addressed. During a normal operation mode, the DFIG is grid-connected and generated power is commanded by combining a sliding-mode control (SMC) scheme, which provides high dynamic performance and robust behaviour, with a model reference adaptive system observer, estimating both rotor position and speed without the use of mechanical sensors. In order to preserve performance during start-up and grid connection without the additional requirement of an encoder, the proposed parameter estimation and grid synchronisation schemes are both sensorless. Moreover, the same SMC structure of the power control strategy is also adopted for the grid synchronisation algorithm, which facilitates transfer between synchronisation and power controllers at the instant of grid connection. Thereby, a global sensorless SMC configuration result, which is self-matched by the parameter estimation process. The resulting scheme has been applied to a hardware-in-the-loop-based DFIG virtual prototype under realistic wind conditions, obtaining satisfactory results.

AB In this work, wind turbine pitch angle control using a Fuzzy controller in real time simulation is presented. This controller is implemented in RTDS (TM) (Real Time Digital Simulator). It was built based on knowledge of operation principles of wind turbines equipped with variable pitch angle control, not requiring mathematical models for this. An alternative for the Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers currently used is presented. The control was developed using CBuilder which is the C program compiler of RTDSTM. It was used a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) equipped with PI controllers for pitch control. Simulations were performed varying the incident wind speed on a wind turbine equipped with PMSM. These simulations prove the efficiency of pitch control using Fuzzy Logic in real time simulations.

ID LOSS MINIMIZATION; MOTOR-DRIVES
AB This paper presents a new technique for the efficiency optimization of an interior permanent magnet synchronous generator, IPMSG, working at variable speed and load. For a given operating condition, characterized by a given turbine speed (omega(T)) and electric torque (T-e), the search control is implemented via the "Rosenbrock" method, which determines the level of the flux current component that results in maximum output power. Once the optimal level of the flux current component is found, this information is used to update the rule base of a fuzzy controller, which plays the role of an implicit mathematical model of the system. As the optimum points associated with the different operating conditions are identified, the rule base is progressively updated, so that the fuzzy controller learns to model the optimal operating conditions for the entire torque-speed plane. After every rule base update, the Rosenbrock controller output is reset, but it is kept active to track possible minor deviations from the optimum point. If compared with other techniques proposed in the scientific literature, this method shows better performance, because once the fuzzy controller learns, the search for the optimum point is immediate.

AB The variable trailing-edge flap concept is introduced in the blades of the wind power system with trailing-edge flaps. When wind speed exceeds the rated value, the wind turbine could adjust trailing-edge flaps to control rotational speed at the rated value, which realizes the control of constant output power. At first the article presents the nonlinear model of wind turbine system with variable trailing-edge flaps. The nonlinear model of wind power system with trailing-edge flaps is global exactly linearized by differential geometry feedback linearization. In the new linearized model, the feedback controller is designed through pole configuration. The simulation results show that the control strategy is capable of constant output power of wind power system effectively with desirable performances and robustness.

Meanwhile, the nonlinear controller, applying backstepping adaptive approach based on virtual parameters, contributes to eliminate the undesirable effects of parametric uncertainties and stochastic disturbance. Moreover, the controller makes the rotor speed track the optimum value exactly by regulating the generator torque.

AB The paper investigates a new type of wind turbine embedded with variable ratio gearbox (VRG) that is capable of dynamically adjusting its transmission ratio between the turbine rotor and the generator. Such wind turbine, when controlled properly, is able to maintain the generator to operated at constant speed, which allows for the conventional synchronous generator to be used to build a wind turbine with grid-friendly features. The fundamental structure and the operational mechanism for the VRG based wind turbine (VRGWT) are examined and analyzed. To further reveal the salient features of the wind turbine, a three-mass dynamic model is proposed with consideration of torsional flexibility of the drive train shaft between the rotor and the generator. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show that maximum power point tracking (MPPT) can be achieved when the generator speed is kept constant, confirming the high conversion efficiency and grid-friendly features of the VRGWT.

ID TURBINE
AB In this paper, a reinforcement learning based adaptive critic controller is proposed for the power capture control of variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). The control objective is to optimize the power capture from wind by tracking the maximum power curve and minimize a predefined long-term cost function in the mean time. By minimizing the long-term cost function, both the power capture and the life time of mechanical part of a wind turbine are considered as opposed to most of existing literatures. The developed controller consists of an action network and a critic network. The critic network is introduced to evaluate the performance of the action network, and learn the cost-to-go function in an online manner. The estimate of cost-to-go function is then transmitted to the action network. The action network is utilized to provide the optimal generator torque rate with the help of the estimate of cost-to-go function. Here, a two-layer neural network structure is employed for both the action and critic network. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is evaluated on a 1.5 MW three-blade wind turbine in simulating environment.

   fluids; synthetic ester; Bio-SLIM (R) transformers
AB Wind energy is one of the fastest growing renewable energy system. The main components required for wind power generation is turbine, gearbox, generator, step up transformer, nacelle and tower. The wind turbine transformers act as a link between wind turbines and distribution grid. It steps up the low output voltage from the generator to higher distribution voltage level. However wind turbine transformers are considered to be one of the sensitive and weak component in a wind farm. The role of wind turbine transformers are usually done by conventional off - shell transformers, but the intermittency of wind power imposes some demanding specifications. The variable output due to variable speed of wind is identified as one of the widespread failure of transformers. Wind turbine transformers are faced with various electrical, mechanical and corrosion related problems. This highlights the fact that conventional distribution transformers cannot act as wind turbine transformers always; its design has to be modified according to the generated output and other external factors. This paper reviews about the role of wind turbine transformer, its failures, and the required design modifications.

AB This paper presents modeling and power quality analysis of an integrated renewable energy system (RES) aimed at supplying electrical power to communities residing at remote locations, far from the grid supply. A decentralized power generation in the form of integrated system is proposed comprising of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system, a wind energy system (WES) and a micro hydro system (MHS) to supply required electric loads. The PV system is modeled with a dc-dc converter for regulating dc output voltage; a maximum power point tracking system (MPPT) is incorporated in order to achieve a reliable power output. The WES is modeled with a variable speed wind-turbine set with fixed pitch angle and the set drives a capacitor excited asynchronous generator (CAG). The CAG, in turn, is modeled with a closed loop turbine input system to account for the drooping characteristics of the asynchronous generator. The MHS consists of a constant power CAG. The three different sources are integrated and connected to a common ac bus and the performances of the system under varying loads are presented. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is proposed in this work for reactive power compensation which, in turn, is expected to improve the power quality of the integrated system. The STATCOM is realized by means of a three-phase IGBT based current controlled voltage source inverter (CC-VSI) with a self-supporting dc bus. The complete system is modeled and simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The results obtained are presented and they are found to be satisfactory.

AB The purpose of the implementation of this study were: (a) Determine the amount of air flow rate of air flow out of the exhaust pipe, (b) Identify the influence of wind speed in the free air against air flow out from the exhaust pipe, (c) Determine the amount of electrical power and energy potential that can be generated, and (d) Identify the feasibility of the utilization of exhaust airflow for WECS development. This research method begins with the collection of primary data, the direct measurement of natural wind speed and exhaust airflow velocity. Secondary data is mainly drawn from the data specification wind turbine selected unit. Subsequent calculation of the relevant variables, such as: electrical power, electrical energy and power coefficient of the rotor. Analysis and discussion focused on finding interplay between measurable variables. From the research, it can be concluded: (a) Exhaust air flow rate contained in the research area, starting a low of 3.92 m/s which is located at a point 15 meters from the source to a high wind reaches 19, 88 m/s which is at a point 3 feet from wind sources. (b) The amount of exhaust air flow rate has a significant effect on the power and potential of electrical energy that can be generated by a wind turbine mini scale, (c) The most important factors that influence the selection of a wind turbine in WECS is the air flow velocity at the local site and rotor power coefficient of each alternative wind turbine. The higher the coefficient of the rotor of a wind turbine, the higher the efficiency of the wind turbine, and (d) The potential airflow considerable waste has yet to be directly used as WECS, but first must be adjusted for the height of the exhaust pipes to achieve the required height.

AB In this paper a novel time-based adaptive second-order sliding mode (SOSM) technique to optimise the efficiency of a variable-speed wind turbine is developed and analised. A revisited form of a recent time-based adaptation algorithm is proposed to deal with the characteristics and control requirements of the wind energy conversion system (WECS), particularly fastly varying disturbances due to gusty wind effects. The revisited algorithm, which enhances the reactivity of the adaptation strategy against fastly varying uncertainties, represents the main theoretical novelty of this work. The proposed controller is extensively assessed through computer simulation of the WECS under study.

AB Small differences in wind speed can lead to great differences in energy capture. Wind speed, direction and inflow angle vary with time and terrain, and power system operation requires well predicted wind-power output from wind farms. Current wind turbines are limited by the fact that the turbine's rotor angle is fixed with respect to wind inflow angle. In order to enhance energy capture from wind turbines a multi-dimensional approach is proposed in which both rotor yaw angle and rotor angular deflection are controlled to achieve the optimal power rating for a wind turbine. A Matlab simulation and a physical model were made to support the validity of this approach. The results from both the simulation and experimental setup indicate that the multi-dimensional approach towards optimal control increases power output by 15% as compared with fixed turbine's rotor angle

AB This paper develops a control method for variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs) to support temporary primary frequency control of power system. The control method contains two parts: (1) up-regulate support control when a frequency drop event occurs; (2) down-regulate support control when a frequency rise event occurs. The up-regulate support is achieved by adaptively utilizing the wind energy curtailed by the pitch control and the kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass of the turbine blades. The down-regulate support is achieved by the pitch control. Furthermore, the up-and down-regulate capabilities are quantified under different wind speeds. Finally, the whole control method is verified in a test power system established in MATLAB/ Simulink, which contains a wind farm of 180 VSWTs.

AB Increasing penetration of wind energy in existing conventional energy systems necessitate better power quality and control. The power electronics is advancing very fast and this facilitates the rapid growth of variable speed wind energy conversion systems (WECS). However, the issue of power quality needs a thorough attention of the people involved in research work. This paper is focusing mainly on the performance comparison of WECSs using doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) where both types of WECSs are using similar kind of the control strategies. The aim of this comparison study is to present various aspects of power quality, especially at the point where the WECS is connected to the grid, in a logical manner. This study also aims to find minimum and maximum wind speeds at which these generators can be operated and power generated by these generators at varying wind speed. Both the Energy conversion systems are using vector control technique. In order to harness maximum power at a particular wind speed, maximum power point tracking has been implemented in both the systems.

AB The demand of energy is increasing day by day and the fossil fuels are moving towards the end. There comes the importance of non-ending sources like wind energy. The proposed system is a wind energy conversion system (WECS) consisting of wind turbine, permanent magnet generator (PMSG), rectifier, Z source inverter and a PWM controller. The voltage obtained from wind is to be boosted to considerable value. So a buck boost converter is used. Here buck boost converter is replaced by Z source inverter. The proposed system is modelled as equation models and also a PWM controller is also done to obtain a constant voltage at output so that it can easily connected to an induction machine. By using modified space vector modulation (MSVPWM) the performance of inverter is improved.

ID SYSTEM
AB This paper derives all necessary equations which require for modeling of PMSG. The generator model is established in the dq-synchronous rotating reference frame. A MATLAB/Simulink simulation has been developed using 8.5 KW permanent magnet synchronous generator. In this paper maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller for variable speed wind turbine is proposed. Maximum power which a wind turbine can deliver at a certain wind speed depends upon certain optimum value of speed at which the shaft rotates. Only at optimum speed we can have efficient use of equipment and available energy source. In order to control a wind turbine with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG), a set of full-scale back-to-back voltage converter is used. The back-to-back converters are connected through a DC-link capacitor. The capacitor decouples the two converters, allowing separate controls being applied to each converter for simplicity. The control systems are separated into generator-side controller and grid-side controller. In this arrangement, the generator-side converter controls the operation of the generator and the network-side converter controls the DC link voltage by exporting active power to the network.
