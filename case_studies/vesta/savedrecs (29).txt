AB In this paper, a grid connected variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) PMSG integrated with the NaS type battery energy storage system (BESS) is modeled in the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) to analyze the performance in the real system. This work is also a part of the future power hardware-in-loop (PHIL) test; therefore, individual components are modeled considering the practical viewpoints. Wind turbine, power grid and control system are modeled in the large time-step main network, however, wind generator (PMSG), frequency converter (FC), BESS integrated with STATCOM are modeled in the RTDS VSC small time-step network to adopt with the higher switching frequencies. Interface transformer is used to connect the different time-step sub network. Option of integrating the anemometer is kept open for future PHIL test. Simulation results are compared with the laboratory standard power system software PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the model developed in the RTDS/RSCAD.

AB This paper describes a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control method using hill-climbing search (HCS) for permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) small wind turbine generation system. The dynamics characteristics are simulated by MATLAB/Simulink. The conventional control method is controlled using a fixed the tip speed ratio. In contrast, HCS-MPPT control method is controlled using a variable the tip speed ratio. As a result, it is verified that HCS-MPPT control method can achieve higher electrical power than the conventional control method when the phase resistance Rs of PMSG is varied.

AB The paper deals with the determination of the optimal control tuning of small Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (up to 10kW), in order to maximize the energy harvesting in urban environment. Because of the highly variable wind speed profiles, it is hard to obtain an optimal set up of the parameters of the system control algorithm. A suitable model including system losses is presented in the paper then, with the aims of maximizing the aerodynamic efficiency of the wind turbine and minimizing the whole system losses, a performance comparison is performed using different control parameters arrangements. Exploiting a precise power flow analysis, the proposed model-based procedure allows us to determine the best tuning configuration of the system.

AB Multipole (gearless) PMSG is one of the most promissing wind turbine generation system for multi-megawatt range, because of its high efficiency and low maintenance advantage. In this digest, the current link topology based wind turbine generation system with simple diode rectifier using MERS (Magnetic Energy Recovery Switch) is proposed. Although diode rectifier is more simple, more robust and inexpensive than active rectifier, the diode rectifier alone is incapable to control the reacvtive power. Thus in this digest the wind energy conversion system with the diode rectifier using MERS is proposed. MERS here functions as a variable capacitor and enables the torque of the generator to be controllable, so that maximum power tracking operation corresponding wind speed change is realized by MERS control. This proposed system possesses several prominent advantages which are presented below.

AB The modern versions of the converters used for renewables (e. g. variable speed wind turbine generator) are connected to the lines (grid) through a both sides PWM controlled dc link voltage source inverter. The fast current control of the line currents by the grid-side converter makes possible to compensate the deviation of the line currents from their fundamental component. This possibility can be used to compensate the lower order current harmonics in the line currents (generated by nonlinear loads on the lines) and to balance the negative sequence current component (caused by asymmetrical load). Besides, advanced control strategies make possible to control the reactive power of the lines, resulting in power factor correction. Since all the mentioned subjects of compensations require at most pulsating active power with zero mean value, the listed compensations are possible even at the absence of the renewable energy source (e. g. at no-wind condition). All the investigated ancillary services improve the power quality of lines (grid) where the renewable energy converter (e. g. wind turbine generator) is connected to. A key element of the system is the sensing of the component to be compensated. A space-vector based sensing method is proposed and investigated. The implementation issues of the presented control methods are detailed. The methods are investigated and validated by simulations of practical examples.

AB The developed strategy presented in this paper deals with a modeling and control of a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) for stand-alone power applications. In fact, the magnitude and frequency of the DFIG stator output voltage are controlled under variable mechanical speed. This task is ensured via the control of d and q components of the rotor flux by means of a back-to-back PWM converter connected to the rotor side of the DFIG. The Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) is coupled mechanically to the wind turbine and supplies a required power to the PWM converter in order to regulate the DC bus voltage to the desired value. A theoretical system analysis with a complete simulation of the overall Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) is carried out to prove the performances of the control strategy. Finally, experimental validation has been carried out on a 1kW wind system laboratory test-bench and experimental results have been given to confirm the control scheme.

A system which accurately emulates the instantaneous torque developed by the wind turbine has been developed and implemented in a laboratory. A turbine model was developed which includes various wind and turbine effects, such as tower shadow or wind shear, in order to emulate the operation of a turbine during transient and steady state conditions. The wind turbine emulator (WTE) allows for various turbines to be easily tested in the laboratory, under any wind conditions.

AB In this paper design and analysis of the grid side converter controller for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind generator connected to a grid through LCL filter are presented. Since utilization of the LCL filter in output of the converter can lead to stability problem due to resonance at high frequency, determination of the controller parameters should be carefully designed. In this study, a simple dynamic model of the LCL filter is developed in order to analyze the performance of the control system easily. By using the bode diagram and step response of the system, the combination of gain controller and damping resistance parameters can be selected. The proposed method has been implemented on the grid side controller design for 2.5 MW PMSG based variable speed wind generator. The simulation results show that the proposed method is very useful and good response performance of the control system can be achieved.

AB This paper is a contribution to the development of real time emulators, applied for marine current energy conversion. The main components of the emulator are: an electromechanical sub-system (ES) and an informatics sub-system (IS); structure based on "hardware-in the-loop" (HILS) simulation techniques. The ES is composed from three electrical drives: an asynchronous machine that emulates the marine turbine, an asynchronous generator, used to study the energy conversion and grid connection, and a break, which develops extra loads and variable moment of inertia. The IS is a supervising and control subsystem and is composed from a computational unit and different interface devices. The studied system is a fixed speed marine current generation system based on Double Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The stator of the generator is directly connected to the grid while the rotor is connected through a back-to-back converter which is dimensioned to stand only for a fraction of the generator rated power.

AB This paper discusses small signal stability analysis of a grid connected fixed speed wind turbine driven induction generator (IG) including series dynamic braking resistor (SDBR). The stator windings of IG are directly connected to a power grid thorough a step-up transformer and transmission line, where SDBR is dynamically inserted in the generation circuit for short time during network disturbance. A detailed mathematical model of IG, transmission line, SDBR and grid is employed to derive the complete dynamic equation of the studied system. The purpose of SDBR is to mitigate the destabilizing depression of electrical torque and power during disturbance period. The power system small signal stability analysis is carried out by eigen value analysis. Modal and sensitivity analyses, participation factors are carried out to discover the relations between the modes and state variables. Finally, this paper presents an analysis of the dynamic behavior of fixed speed wind generator under voltage dip conditions with and without considering SDBR. The results of these studies are verified by a time domain simulation model developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK.

AB In this paper, combination system of squirrel cage induction generator based fixed speed wind turbine and permanent magnet synchronous generator based variable speed wind turbine is considered to improve voltage stability of a wind farm. A suitable control scheme for back-to-back converter of variable speed permanent magnet synchronous generator is developed to improve the voltage stability as well as reactive power compensation of the fixed speed induction wind generator in cases of disturbed and normal conditions. The transient and steady state conditions are analyzed using PSCAD/EMTDC, and it is concluded that the proposed topology is effective to enhance the voltage stability of wind farm for network fault disturbance and fluctuating wind speed.

AB A model for the mechanical dynamics of a wind turbine is developed, which is the composition of three physical mechanisms: flexion, torsion, and rotational dynamics. A first contribution is the identification of the essential physical parameters that provide a time-scale separation of these three mechanisms. Under the assumption of singular perturbations the time-scale separation allows to work with a reduced model of order one. This reduction has been essential for the control of this system allowing to control designers to take into account only the reduced-order model. A second contribution consists in employing a measurement of the fore-aft nacelle acceleration with the reduced model, together with a Kalman filter to estimate the flexible DOFs of the system (tower and average blade deflection). The successful approach is tested on high-order nonlinear aeroelastic simulator (FAST).

AB The current paper discusses an on-going research effort in the performance evaluation and optimization of rim-drive wind turbines (RDWT). Unlike conventional aerofoil wind turbines, the RDWTs are designed to extract power directly from the outer rim instead of central hub. A RDWT with 25ft rotor diameter is tested for performance evaluation and maximum power extracted. The experiment is conducted at Wind Science and Engineering research center, located in Lubbock, Texas. The wind turbine is coupled to a variable speed direct drive electric generator. The induction current in the generator is optimized for different wind speeds in order to extract maximum power from the wind turbine. The experimental results are compared with two commercial aerofoil wind turbines of similar design specifications using performance evaluation data published by National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It is observed that RDWT can extract comparable and often higher amount of energy when compared with aerofoil wind turbines. The results also show that RDWT has an average power coefficient of 0.3 and can operate in wider spectrum of wind speeds than aerofoil wind turbines.

AB Multi-blade shaft driven wind turbines depend greatly on the angle of attack as an important factor that the control system monitors such that a maximum amount of aerodynamic force is seen by the rotor blades. This is one significant difference when controlling a Rim Driven Wind Turbine (RDWT). The controller for a RDWT is required to simply point the tower such that it is facing the wind for maximum power generation. This is achieved by incorporating a Variable Speed Direct Drive (VSDD) wind operation control system to control the power production and safe operation of the RDWT. Another consideration for the control system is its integration with the generator. Since the power generation is rim driven, thus operating at a higher variable speed.
   With information related to the wind turbine's diameter and the wind speed at any given time it can be calculated how much power can be potentially generated. This can then be in turn relayed to the generator from the wind turbine controller. This information can be relayed using controller-controller communication (such as an analog voltage signal Figure 1: RDWT Tested in Texas or protocol based communication such as MODBUS RTU or TCP/IP) representing the power coefficient from Betz' Law.
   A feasibly controllable system implements a signal from the overall wind turbine controller that in turn supplies the generator with how much power is available in the system to maximize power generation for a broad range of traditionally unrealizable wind conditions (3 m/s to 30 m/s). Rim Driven Wind Turbines represent an evolution in fundamental design of how the wind can be harnessed for power.
   This paper will discuss the VSDD's unique design and aspects of maintaining controllability thorough out the overall system operation.

AB In this paper, we tried to estimate the effect of control method on floating offshore wind turbine. The experiment in the water basin revealed that traditional blade pitch control can amplify the platform pitch oscillation of floating wind turbine. In order to understand the physical phenomenon, we used aeroelastic simulation using GH Bladed. Turbine model is based on the turbine used in wind tunnel test. To simulate the pitching motion of floating platform, we used onshore wind turbine model with inflow with oscillating wind speed that simulates relative wind speed change from wind turbine's fore-aft pitching motion. Two types of control method are used; fixed pitch variable speed control which represents before rated state of large wind turbines and variable pitch variable speed control which represents over rated state of large wind turbines. Comparing the relation between wind speed change and rotor thrust force change of two control methods, we made it clear that traditional blade pitch control method make thrust force change almost the inverse of wind speed increase and decrease. From thrust force inverse to wind speed change, tower pitching motion can be amplified. That is, blade pitch control can induce negative damping on tower pitching motion. As a conclusion pitch control can increase larger blade load although pitch control aims to reduce the blade load. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The reliability of frequency converters is a major concern for wind turbines. ChapDrive AS has built and tested a hydraulic drive train for variable speed wind turbines which includes a synchronous generator that is connected to the grid without the use of a frequency converter. The hydraulic drive train consists of a hydraulic pump, a variable displacement hydraulic motor, and a synchronous generator, which enables rotor speed control while maintaining synchronous speed of the generator. It has been proven that the hydraulic drive train and the ChapDrive Control system are able to absorb fluctuations in the wind speed and maintain a constant power output without the use of frequency converters. The hydraulic drive train and the ChapDrive Control system has been modeled analytically and compared to measurements, demonstrating a good agreement between simulations and measurements.

AB The objective of this work is to validate wind turbine models available in commercial simulation tools with measurements. Results are shown for two turbines located in two different wind farms; wind turbine 1 is a fixed speed turbine with induction generator, and wind turbine 2 is a variable speed turbine with converter-interfaced synchronous generator. Simulated active and reactive power transient responses to voltage dips have been compared to measured responses, as suggested by IEA Wind Annex 21. For the fixed speed turbine quite good agreement between measurement and simulation is obtained. Shaft parameters are seen to have significant influence on the simulated active power response. For the variable speed turbine the active and reactive power responses are to a high degree determined by the power electronics interface and corresponding controllers, and particularly the control strategy applied during voltage dips. Wind turbine manufacturers are generally very restrictive on giving out this type of information, and thus typical configurations and parameters have been used in this work. The agreement between measurement and simulation can to some degree be improved by changing the inverter controller parameters by trial- and error, but detailed knowledge on the control of the converter would be required in order to achieve a very good agreement.

AB In this study, the electricity generation ability for the main campus area of Dumlupinar University in Kutahya, using a solar-wind hybrid power (SWHP) system, is investigated. In the study, the solar data of the region and the wind data measured between July 2001 and June 2004 (36 months) were evaluated to determine energy potential of the region. To this end, optimum solar panel position was determined and wind energy potential was evaluated for four different wind turbines. Six different scenarios addressed by using life cycle cost (LCC) analysis were investigated in the viewpoint of technical and economic aspects of the system. As result, the position in which the maximum solar radiation was obtained, with a value of 134.14 kW/m(2), has been determined as gamma = 0 degrees and beta = 30 degrees for fixed-panel model taking the annual average solar radiation into account. For variable panel positions, the highest radiation value with 197.8 kW/m(2) was obtained in July at gamma = 0 degrees and beta = 2 degrees when the minimum with 89.4 kW/m(2) was obtained in December at gamma = 0 degrees and beta = 65 degrees. Moreover, the assessment of wind potential of the region on monthly average basis was found between with 3.9-5.3 m/s with the capacity factor of wind turbines varied between 8.2 and 23.7%. As a result of economic considerations, the scenarios with Present Worth Factor (PWF) of greater than 10 is were found to be feasible. In these scenarios, the installed capacity of wind was found to be higher relative to solar one.

AB Weather conditions are related to wind turbine power output and maintenance therefore, it now becomes interesting to use stochastic approaches to study regional weather conditions. In this paper, this approach was taken, based on real sampled data for a statistically representative time period. Results showed an adequate curve fit of the different probability density functions like Exponential, Gaussian, Log-Normal, GaussCum, Gamma, WeibullCum and Weibull distributions. Further, a common probability density function for all these weather variables was understood as a Weibull peak function with ten minutes of real sampled data, over a ten-year period. Once the Weibull model for each year and variable was defined, the relationship was analysed using the Pearson's correlation factor that was employed as a validation tool of weather forecast. Results showed that the partial vapour pressure of moist air resulted in a better approach with GSI than moist air dry bulb temperature, and particularly thermal comfort indices, specifically humidex, showed a good approach. Aiming to define a common model for all the weather variables, the determination factor between all the weather model constants was calculated for each year showing a relation between pressure and temperature and wind velocity. Finally, a practical case study of stochastic approach of wind power output was developed and the probability density functions of the main control parameters of the wind power station were defined.

AB A new algorithm for shaft position sensor-less independent control of real and reactive power of the Brushless Doubly-Fed Reluctance Machine (BDFRM), an emerging competitive for applications with limited variable speed ranges (e.g. pumps or wind turbines), is proposed and experimentally verified in this paper. The algorithm is inspired by the fundamental operating principles of the machine and does not depend on any parameters. Therefore, it is more robust than model-based control approaches which often suffer from sensitivity issues and performance trade-offs associated with machine parameter variations or their inaccurate identification. In turn, the considered control method merely relies on the grid-connected winding voltage and current signals. Practical studies including speed tracking, power factor regulation and load response have demonstrated high performance of the scheme on a custom designed 1.5 kW prototype. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) technique combined with predictive approach, a FMMPC law is designed easily by solving a convex optimization problem subject to LMI conditions. Then, such controller is developed to maintain a satisfactory quality of power in high wind speed operating region by reducing mechanical loads. The performances of the wind turbine in terms of wind turbine rotational speed and its stability, relative to wind speed changes, are discussed. The effectiveness and the merit of the proposed approach are shown by simulation results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of a variable speed wind turbine using a direct-drive permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) as well as a PMSG with single stage planetary gearbox is compared for two grades of electric steel applied for the generator stator core lamination. A ring type, radial flux PMSG is modeled. For a fixed mechanical power input, the geometry of the generator is optimized for each turbine systems and two materials to maximize the annual efficiency of the generator. The annual efficiency is calculated based on the power curve of the generator and the probability density function of the wind speed. This function is approximated by the Weibull distribution function for a site with average wind speed of 7 m/s. For both generator systems, the annual efficiency of two optimized generators using different steel grades differs around 1%. The difference depends on a mass of active material of the generator.

Relationships between the operational phase and control rules for the speed of rotation are derived for each of these phases. Taking into account the characteristics of the control strategies in the different operational phases, a global control strategy is designed to ensure the stable operation of the wind turbine in all phases. The results of simulations are presented that indicate that the proposed algorithm can control the individual phases when considered in isolation and also when they are considered in combination. Thus, a global control strategy for a wind turbine that is based on a single algorithm is presented which could have significant implications on the control and use of wind turbines.

AB The roughness increase on horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) blade surface, especially on the leading edge, can lead to an aerodynamic performance degradation of blade and power output loss of HAWT, so roughness sensitivity is an important factor for the HAWT blade design. However, there is no criterion for evaluating roughness sensitivity of blade currently. In this paper, the performance influences of airfoil aerodynamic parameters were analyzed by the blade element momentum (BEM) method and 1.5 MW wind turbine blade. It showed that airfoil lift coefficient was the key parameter to the power output and axial thrust of HAWT. Moreover, the evaluation indicators of roughness sensitivity for the different spanwise airfoils of the pitch-regulated HAWT blade were proposed. Those respectively were the lift-to-drag ratio and lift coefficient without feedback system, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio and design lift coefficient with feedback system for the airfoils at outboard section of blade, and lift coefficient without feedback, maximum lift coefficient with feedback for the airfoils at other sections under the pitch-fixed and variable-speed operation. It is not necessary to consider the roughness when HWAT can be regulated to the rated power output by the pitch-regulated and invariable-speed operation.

AB This paper proposes novel multiconverter operation and control scheme for variable speed wind energy conversion system to withstand against grid fault. The full or partial rating frequency converters (FCs), in general, are widely used in variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driven wind generators. Among the variable speed wind generators, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), which uses a full rating FC for grid interfacing, is drawing much attention nowadays due to its salient features. However, considering the factors such as higher-reliability, higher efficiency, and lower harmonics, the multiconverter based topology might be preferable instead of using a full rating FC. This paper proposes a coordinated control scheme for multiple parallel-connected FC units integrated with VSWT driving PMSG to augments the transient performance during a network disturbance. Multimode operation (inverter and rectifier) of the individual FC unit is another salient feature of this study. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper, a novel algorithm, based on dc link voltage, is proposed for effective energy management of a stand-alone permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based variable speed wind energy conversion system consisting of battery, fuel cell, and dump load (i.e., electrolyzer). Moreover, by maintaining the dc link voltage at its reference value, the output ac voltage of the inverter can be kept constant irrespective of variations in the wind speed and load. An effective control technique for the inverter, based on the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) scheme, has been developed to make the line voltages at the point of common coupling (PCC) balanced when the load is unbalanced. Similarly, a proper control of battery current through dc-dc converter has been carried out to reduce the electrical torque pulsation of the PMSG under an unbalanced load scenario. Based on extensive simulation results using MATLAB/SIMULINK, it has been established that the performance of the controllers both in transient as well as in steady state is quite satisfactory and it can also maintain maximum power point tracking.

The expressions are valid for heights above the ground in the range 40-80 m, site separations of 1-30 km, and frequencies of (1/6)-3 cycles h(-1). The influence of site separation distance is taken into account, as are variables that are defined for blocks of time. These variables include the mean and standard deviation of wind speed and the mean wind direction. The parameters of the model equations are determined by non-linear least-squares regression with cross-validation over 10 years of wind measurements from 84 towers in south-eastern Australia.

The system consists of a variable speed wind turbine coupled to a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) through a gear box, a diode bridge rectifier, a dc-to-dc boost converter and a current controlled voltage source inverter. The maximum power point tracker (MPPT) extracts maximum power from the wind turbine from cut-in to rated wind velocity by sensing only dc link power.

AB Recent fault ride-through (FRT) requirements have proven problematic for variable-speed wind generation systems. A particular problem regarding to doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) is that standard proportional integral (PI) current controllers, designed with very limited control bandwidth, cannot eliminate rotor current oscillations that occur during a grid fault. As a consequence, the current in the rotor-side converter can exceed the safety limits of semiconductor switches, which potentially leads to converter failure. This study introduces a hybrid current controller to enhance the FRT capability of DFIGs through keeping the rotor current below the safety limits. The proposed current controller includes two switching strategies: the standard PI current controller for normal operating conditions and a vector-based hysteresis current controller (with very fast transient response) for overcurrent protection during grid faults. Simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid current controller under various symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage sag conditions.

ID EXTREME RESPONSE
AB The paper explores a recently developed method for statistical response load (load effect) extrapolation for application to extreme response of wind turbines during operation. The extrapolation method is based on average conditional exceedance rates and is in the present implementation restricted to cases where the Gumbel distribution is the appropriate asymptotic extreme value distribution. However, two extra parameters are introduced by which a more general and flexible class of extreme value distributions is obtained with the Gumbel distribution as a subclass. The general method is implemented within a hierarchical model where the variables that influence the loading are divided into ergodic variables and time-invariant non-ergodic variables.
   The presented method for statistical response load extrapolation was compared with the existing methods based on peak extrapolation for the blade out-of-plane bending moment and the tower mudline bending moment of a pitch-controlled wind turbine. In general, the results show that the method based on average conditional exceedance rates predicts the extrapolated characteristic response loads at the individual mean wind speeds well and results in more consistent estimates than the methods based on peak extrapolation.

AB The investment decision on the placement of wind turbines is, neglecting legal formalities, mainly driven by the aim to maximize the expected annual energy production of single turbines. The result is a concentration of wind farms at locations with high average wind speed. While this strategy may be optimal for single investors maximizing their own return on investment, the resulting overall allocation of wind turbines may be unfavorable for energy suppliers and the economy because of large fluctuations in the overall wind power output. This paper investigates to what extent optimal allocation of wind farms in Germany can reduce these fluctuations. We analyze stochastic dependencies of wind speed for a large data set of German on- and offshore weather stations and find that these dependencies turn out to be highly nonlinear but constant over time. Using copula theory we determine the value at risk of energy production for given allocation sets of wind farms and derive optimal allocation plans. We find that the optimized allocation of wind farms may substantially stabilize the overall wind energy supply on daily as well as hourly frequency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Renewable energy technologies have recently attracted intensive attentions. Several renewable energies, such as wind, solar, etc., are being investigated to solve current energy crisis. In this paper, a nonlinear controller is developed for tracking control of a wind energy conversion system under a hierarchical configuration. First, an adaptive neural-network-based estimator is developed to estimate uncertain (possibly unknown) aerodynamics online. Based on an estimated value of aerodynamics, a model-based adaptive tracking control law is derived based on the Lyapunov stability analysis. Associated dynamic parameter estimators are also developed to remove requirement of prior knowledge of system parameters. Then, robust differentiator techniques are utilized to eliminate the need for an acceleration of the wind and rotor. It is shown that the proposed controller can regulate tracking error to an arbitrary small value even if neither system parameter nor aerodynamics is available for control design. It is expected that the proposed control algorithm can be used as an "universal controller" for similar types of variable speed wind turbine with minimal modifications. The modularity of the proposed controller will enjoy the plug-and-play property that will be helpful in distributed control of smart grids. Simulation studies are performed along with the theoretical analysis to validate the proposed method.

Simulation results reveal that this configuration is advantageous with respect to energy efficiency compared to a traditional six-switch two-level converter. In addition, it can have higher reliability, due to reduced blocking voltage stress across the semiconductors. The theoretical analysis and feasibility of the proposed configuration are validated by experimental results obtained from a prototype system.

AB This study was interested in the management of an energy production unit. A variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) was used as a principal source and a supercapacitor (SC) module was used as an energy storage system. Both were connected through a direct current bus. This unit was supplying a three-phase load using an inverter and an inductor and capacitor filter. In order to regulate the direct current bus voltage, the SC storage state was controlled by using a buck-boost converter according to load instructions and wind speed fluctuations. Then, a resonant controller was established to avoid any disturbances and to control the alternating line-to-line voltages of the load which may be unbalanced. This study has shown that the stability of the three-phase voltage source depends on the direct current bus power management and also on the line-to-line voltage control. Simulation results are presented to validate the efficiency of the control strategies used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel rectifier topology consisting of two three-phase diode bridges and three thyristors is proposed in the paper for variable-speed high-power permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). The proposed rectifier has several prominent features such as low cost, low power loss, and simple control. Its ability to cascade the input voltages allows it to properly regulate generator speed even when the wind velocity drops to half of the rated value. Consequently, maximum power-point-tracking algorithms can be applied to optimize power capture in a wide range of wind velocities. The operating principle of the rectifier is elaborated. Its use and control in the WECS is presented. The converter and control are verified by simulation and experimental results.

The proposed control scheme is based on computing the optimal wind farm electrical frequency depending on the different incoming wind speeds. The power converter regulates the system frequency by adjusting the power injected to the HVDC circuit. Fault ride-through is also possible by reducing rapidly the injected active power. The proposed scheme is validated by means of simulations with a wind farm composed of four wind turbines.

AB Today, many countries are integrating large amount of wind energy into the grid and many more are expected to follow. The expected increase of wind energy integration is therefore a concern particularly to transmission grid operators. Based on the past experience, some of the relevant concerns when connecting significant amount of wind energy into the existing grid are: fault ride through requirement to keep wind turbines on the grid during faults and wind turbines have to provide ancillary services like voltage and frequency control with particular regard to island operation.
   While there are still a number of wind turbines based on fixed speed induction generators (FSIG) currently running, majority of wind turbines that are planned to be erected are of variable speed configurations. The reason for this is that FSIG are not capable of addressing the concern mentioned above. Thus, existing researches in wind turbines are now widely directed into variable speed configurations. This is because apart from optimum energy capture and reduction of mechanical stress, preference of these types is also due to the fact that it can support the network such as its reactive power and frequency regulation. Variable wind turbines are doubly fed induction generator wind turbines and full converters wind turbines which are based on synchronous or induction generators.
   This paper describes the steady state and dynamic models and control strategies of wind turbine generators. The dynamic models are presented in the dq frame of reference. Different control strategies in the generator side converter and in the grid side converter for fault ride through requirement and active power/frequency and reactive/voltage control are presented for variable speed wind turbines.

AB Noise continues to be a significant factor in the development of wind energy resources. In the case of building-mounted wind turbines (BMWTs), in addition to the usual airborne sound there is the potential for occupants to be affected by structure-borne sound and vibration transmitted through the building structure. Usual methods for prediction and evaluation of noise from large and small WTs are not applicable to noise of this type. This letter describes an investigation aiming to derive a methodology for prediction of structure-borne sound and vibration inside attached dwellings. Jointly funded by three UK government departments, the work was motivated by a desire to stimulate renewable energy generation by the removal of planning restrictions where possible. A method for characterizing BMWTs as sources of structure-borne sound was first developed during a field survey of two small wind turbines under variable wind conditions. The 'source strength' was established as a function of rotor speed although a general relationship to wind speed could not be established. The influence of turbulence was also investigated. The prediction methodology, which also accounts for the sound transmission properties of the mast and supporting building, was verified in a field survey of existing installations. Significant differences in behavior and subjective character were noted between the airborne and structure-borne noise from BMWTs.

AB Studying migratory behavior of bats is challenging. Thus, most information regarding their migratory behavior is anecdotal. Recently, however, fatalities of migratory bats at some wind energy facilities across North America have provided the opportunity and impetus to study bat migration at fine spatial and temporal scales. Using acoustic monitoring and carcass searches, we examined temporal and spatial variation in activity levels and fatality rates of bats at a wind energy facility in southern Alberta, Canada. Our goals were to better understand the influence of weather variables and turbine location on the activity and fatality of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), and to use that understanding to predict variation in fatality rates at wind energy facilities and recommend measures to reduce fatalities. Overall activity of migratory bats and of silver-haired bats increased in low wind speeds and warm ambient temperatures, and was reduced when the wind was from the North or Northeast, whereas hoary bat activity increased with falling barometric pressure. Fatalities of migratory bats in general increased with increased activity of migratory bats, increased moon illumination, and falling barometric pressure and were influenced by the interaction between barometric pressure change and activity. Fatalities of silver-haired bats increased with increased activity, moon illumination, and winds from the south-east. Hoary bat fatalities increased with falling barometric pressure. Our results indicate that both the activity and fatality of migratory bats are affected by weather variables, but that species differ in their responses to environmental conditions. Spatially, fatalities were not influenced by the position of turbines within a turbine row, but were influenced by the location of turbines within the facility. Our findings have implications for our understanding of bat migration and efforts to reduce fatalities at wind energy facilities. To maximize the reduction of bat fatalities, operators of wind energy facilities could incorporate migratory bats' response to environmental variables, such as barometric pressure and fraction of moon illuminated, into their existing mitigation strategies.

The control objective results from optimizing the integral of a quadratic function that includes two contradictory demands: maximization of the energy captured from the stochastic wind behavior and minimization of the damage caused by mechanical fatigue. This trade-off in the combined performance criterion is realized by choosing the coefficient alpha. In this study, the optimal control law is obtained by a new approach based on the linearization of stochastic system and linear properties of measures. Representing the problem in variational form, transferring to a measure space globally and determining the optimal strategy via a finite linear programming are the steps of this approach. The method has many advantages compared with others like easy computational method, globality and guarantees the existence of solutions. The presented numerical simulations show a better efficiency as well. Also, the optimal value for a is calculated by Genetic Algorithm.

AB This paper presents a feedback/feedforward nonlinear controller for variable-speed wind turbines with doubly fed induction generators. By appropriately adjusting the rotor voltages and the blade pitch angle, the controller simultaneously enables: 1) control of the active power in both the maximum power tracking and power regulation modes; 2) seamless switching between the two modes; and 3) control of the reactive power so that a desirable power factor is maintained. Unlike many existing designs, the controller is developed based on original, nonlinear, electromechanically-coupled models of wind turbines, without attempting approximate linearization. Its development consists of three steps: 1) employ feedback linearization to exactly cancel some of the nonlinearities and perform arbitrary pole placement; 2) design a speed controller that makes the rotor angular velocity track a desired reference whenever possible; and 3) introduce a Lyapunov-like function and present a gradient-based approach for minimizing this function. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated through simulation of a wind turbine operating under several scenarios.

AB A multivariable control strategy based on model predictive control techniques for the control of variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines is proposed. The proposed control strategy is described for the whole operating region of the wind turbine, i.e., both partial and full load regimes. Pitch angle and generator torque are controlled simultaneously to maximize energy capture, mitigate drive train transient loads, and smooth the power generated while reducing the pitch actuator activity. This has the effect of improving the efficiency and the power quality of the electrical power generated, and increasing the life expectancy of the installation. Furthermore, safe and acceptable operation of the system is guaranteed by incorporating most of the constraints on the physical variables of the wind energy conversion system (WECS) in the controller design. In order to cope with nonlinearities in theWECS and continuous variations in the operating point, a multiple model predictive controller is suggested which provides acceptable performance throughout the whole operating region.

AB This paper presents an improvement technique for the power quality of the electrical part of a wind generation system with a self-excited induction generator (SEIG) which aims to optimize the utilization of wind power injected into weak grids. To realize this goal, an uncontrolled rectifier-digitally controlled inverter system is proposed. The advantage of the proposed system is its simplicity due to fewer controlled switches which leads to less control complexity. It also provides full control of active and reactive power injected into the grid using a voltage source inverter (VSI) as a dynamic volt ampere reactive (VAR) compensator. A voltage oriented control (VOC) scheme is presented in order to control the energy to be injected into the grid. In an attempt to minimize the harmonics in the inverter current and voltage and to avoid poor power quality of the wind energy conversion system (WECS), an filter is inserted between VOC VSI and the grid. The proposed technique is implemented by a digital signal processor (DSP TMS320F240) to verify the validity of the proposed model and show its practical superiority in renewable energy applications.
