AB We describe modeling and control methods for a variable speed squirrel-cage asynchronous (induction) generator with power electronic converters. A comprehensive dynamical model of the SCAG wind turbine and its control scheme is presented. The control scheme consists of wind turbine control and power converter control. Wind speed variations, local load variations, and voltage sag are simulated. Through these simulations, the capabilities of the proposed reactive power control design, which can adjust the voltage variations in a point of common coupling (PCC. Bus 4) to preset values when connecting wind power generation systems, are evaluated and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The west and south coastal region of Korea has very strong tidal current speeds and therefore accommodates many suitable sites for the application of TCP (Tidal Current Power). The maximum current speed recorded in the south is up to 6.5 m/s. Unlike other renewable energy sources, TCP is an extremely reliable, predictable and continuous energy source as the current pattern and speed can be predicted throughout the year. One of the essential components in a TCP device is the rotor converting the inflow current into the rotational energy. The design optimization of the rotor is very important to maximize the power production. The performance of the rotor can be determined by various parameters including the number of blades, shape, sectional size, hub. diameters etc.
   The blade of the rotor is one of the essential components which can convert tidal current energy into rotational energy to generate electricity. The variable blade properties determine the performance, efficiency and stability of the turbine system. This paper presents the design procedure for a 300 kW tidal current turbine blade. The HAT turbine model was designed based on the wind mill turbine design principles together with known turbine theories. To verify the compatibility of the turbine design method and to analyze the properties of design factors, the 3D CFD model was applied with the ANSYS CFX program. The characteristics and performances of the blades can be applied in the design of 300 KW and larger capacity TCP rotors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, some solutions based on diode rectifiers are extensively analyzed as for the waveforms, the efficiency, and the torque ripple, by considering several connections, which are allowed by the inherent modularity of the considered generators. Rectifier schemes with a high number of pulses can be easily realized without using special shifter transformers so that these solutions can be attractive for low- and medium-power applications.

AB This paper proposes a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique for variable pitch wind generators with induction machines, which can suitably be adopted in both the maximum power range and the constant power range of the wind speed. For this purpose, an MPPT technique based on the growing neural gas (GNG) wind turbine surface identification and the corresponding function inversion has been adopted to cover also the situation of constant rated power region. This has been obtained by including the blade pitch angle in the space of the data learnt by the GNG and feeding back the estimated wind speed to compute the correct value of the pitch angle, which permits the machine to work at rated power and torque. A further enhancement of the pitch angle selection by a simple perturb & observe method has been added to cope with slight wind estimation errors occurring at machine rated speed. The proposed methodology has been verified both in numerical simulation and experimentally on a properly devised test setup. The correct behavior of the system has been proved also on a real wind speed profile on a daily scale.

AB This paper describes an analysis of wake measurements from the research farm at the ECN Wind Turbine Test Site Wieringermeer. This research farm is owned and operated by the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands. The farm consists of five research turbines that are oriented in a single line with a mutual distance of 3.8D(iameter). The turbines are variable speed and pitch controlled, and they have a diameter and a hub height of 80 m. The rated power of the turbines is 2.5 MW. Extensive machine measurements (power, loads, yaw angle and pitch angles) are carried out on these turbines. In parallel, meteorological measurements are done on a 108 m mast that is instrumented at three heights (hub height and hub height +/- 70% span) with sonic anemometers and cups and wind vanes. This mast is located at a shortest distance of 2.5D from one of the turbines. Data have been collected over a period of almost 5 years, and they are used to study several phenomena mainly related to wake aerodynamics, e.g. power losses in the wake of up to four wind turbines and meteorological wake phenomena at different distances behind the turbines.

The conditions tested in a test bench are similar to the ones that can be found in different kinds of machines like for example wind turbines. The authors demonstrate how to take advantage of the information on vibrations from the mechanical system under study in a wide range of load and speed conditions. Using such information the prognosis and detection of faults is faster and more reliable than the one obtained from an analysis over a restricted range of working conditions (e.g. nominal).

AB A medium voltage power interface for a variable speed Wind Turbine is presented in this paper. The converter topology consists on the Back-to-Back connection of two medium voltage Diode Clamped Multilevel Inverters (DCMI) in the full power path. This mitigates traditional tradeoffs around the low voltage connection between the generator and the grid on the megawatt range. Also, this configuration allows for higher control versatility for grid codes compliance. The converter controllers are based on a Finite-States Model Predictive Control approach, leading to fast dynamic response and DC bus voltage equalization. The control scheme can be used with converters of an arbitrary number of levels with reduced computational effort. This is based on necessary switching restrictions which allow the reliable operation of converter legs. The performance of the control scheme is evaluated through computer simulations.

The technology of backstepping is introduced to design the controller for maximum power point tracking at the operation region with low and moderate wind, and the high-gain observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable variables needed for the controller design. Moreover, a switching mechanism is proposed, in which an online rotational speed is defined for the startup-to-grid-connected switch of the half-direct permanent magnet wind power generation system. Then, the stability of the designed closed-loop controlled system is analysed, based on the Lyapunov asymptotical stability theory. Simulation results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed control law.

ID DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; EXTREME RESPONSE; SIMULATION
AB This paper discusses the estimation of the failure probability of wind turbines required by codes of practice for designing them. The Standard Monte Carlo (SMC) simulations may be used for this reason conceptually as an alternative to the popular Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) method. However, estimation of very low failure probabilities with SMC simulations leads to unacceptably high computational costs. In this study, an Enhanced Monte Carlo (EMC) method is proposed that overcomes this obstacle. The method has advantages over both POT and SMC in terms of its low computational cost and accuracy. The method is applied to a low-order numerical model of a 5 MW wind turbine with a pitch controller exposed to a turbulent inflow. Two cases of the wind turbine model are investigated. In the first case, the rotor is running with a constant rotational speed. In the second case, the variable rotational speed is controlled by the pitch controller. This provides a fair framework for comparison of the behavior and failure event of the wind turbine with emphasis on the effect of the pitch controller. The Enhanced Monte Carlo method is then applied to the model and the failure probabilities of the model are estimated to the values related to the required 50-year return period of the wind turbine.

AB Megawatt class wind turbines generally turn at variable speed in wind farm. Thus turbine operation must be controlled in order to maximize the conversion efficiency below rated power and reduce loading on the drive train. In addition, researchers particularly employ pitch control of the blades to manage the energy captured throughout operation above and below rated wind speed. In this study, fuzzy rules have been successfully extracted from Neural Network (NN) using a new Genetic Fuzzy System (GFS). Fuzzy Rule Extraction from Neural network using Genetic Algorithm (FRENGA) rejects wind disturbance in Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS) input with pitch angel control generation. Consequently, our proposed approach has regulated output aerodynamic power and torque in the nominal range. Results indicate that the new proposed genetic fuzzy rule extraction system outperforms one of the best and earliest methods in controlling the output during wind fluctuation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The loads on wind turbine components are primarily from the blades. It is important to control these loads in order to avoid damaging the wind turbine. Rotor control technology is currently limited to controlling the rotor speed and the blade pitch. As blades increase in length, it becomes less desirable to pitch the entire blade as a single rigid body, but there is a requirement to control loads more precisely along the length of the blade. This can be achieved with aerodynamic control devices such as flaps. Morphing structures are good candidates for wind turbine flaps because they have the potential to create structures that have the conflicting abilities of being load carrying, lightweight and shape adaptive. A morphing flap design with an anisotropic cellular structure is presented, which is able to undergo large deflections and high strains. An aeroelastic analysis couples the work done by aerodynamic loads on the flap, the flap strain energy and the required actuation work to change shape. The morphing flap model is manufactured, and its stiffness is measured.

AB Fatalities of migratory bats, many of which use low frequency (<35?kHz; LowF) echolocation calls, have become a primary environmental concern associated with wind energy development. Accordingly, strategies to improve compatibility between wind energy development and conservation of bat populations are needed. We combined results of continuous echolocation and meteorological monitoring at multiple stations to model conditions that explained presence of LowF bats at a wind energy facility in southern California. We used a site occupancy approach to model nightly LowF bat presence while accounting for variation in detection probability among echolocation detectors and heights. However, we transposed the spatial and temporal axes of the conventional detection history matrix such that occupancy represented proportion of nights, rather than monitoring points, on which LowF bats were detected. Detectors at 22?m and 52?m above ground had greater detection probabilities for LowF bats than detectors at 2?m above ground. Occupancy of LowF bats was associated with lower nightly wind speeds and higher nightly temperatures, mirroring results from other wind energy facilities. Nevertheless, we found that building separate models for each season and considering solutions with multiple covariates resulted in better fitting models. We suggest that use of multiple environmental variables to predict bat presence could improve efficiency of turbine operational mitigations (e.g., changes to cut-in speeds) over those based solely on wind speed. Increased mitigation efficiencies could lead to greater use of mitigations at wind energy facilities with benefits to bat populations. (c) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB This paper presents an optimum design procedure for the controller used in the frequency converter of a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) by using genetic algorithms (GAs) and response surface methodology (RSM). The cascaded control is frequently used in the control of the frequency converter using the proportional plus integral (PI) controllers. The setting of the parameters of the PI controller used in a large system is cumbersome, especially in an electrical power system, which is difficult to be expressed by a mathematical model or transfer function. This study attempts to optimally design the parameters of the PI controllers used in the frequency converter of a variable speed wind energy conversion system (WECS). The effectiveness of the designed parameters using GAs-RSM is then compared with that obtained using a generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm considering both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults. The permanent fault condition due to unsuccessful reclosing of circuit breakers is considered as well. It represents another salient feature of this study. It is found that fault-ride-through of VSWT-PMSG can be improved considerably using the parameters of its frequency converter obtained from GAs-RSM.

The Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model with parametric uncertainties is adopted for modeling the nonlinear WECS and establishing fuzzy state observers. Sufficient conditions are derived for robust stabilization in the sense of Taylor series stability and are formulated in linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Application to WECS, subject to uncertain parameters and sensor faults illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

AB This paper considers the problem of power regulation for a variable speed wind turbine in the presence of a blade tip speed constraint, for example to limit noise emissions. The main contribution of the paper is the formulation of a policy for the regulation of the machine in the transition region between the classical regions II and III that accommodates the tip speed constraint, and the derivation of associated wind schedules for the rotor speed, blade pitch and aerodynamic torque. To exemplify the possible use of such wind schedules in the design of control laws, model-based controllers are formulated in this paper that are capable of performing power curve tracking throughout all wind speeds, in contrast with commonly adopted approaches that use switching controllers to cover the various operating regimes of the machine. The proposed regulation policies and control laws are demonstrated in a high fidelity simulation environment for a representative 3 MW machine. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Among the several wind generation technologies, variable-speed wind turbines utilizing doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) are gaining momentum in the power industry. Increased penetration of these wind turbine generators displaces conventional synchronous generators which results in erosion of system frequency. With this assertion, the paper analyzes the dynamic participation of DFIG for frequency control of an interconnected two-area power system in restructured competitive electricity market. Frequency control support function responding proportionally to frequency deviation is proposed to take out the kinetic energy of wind turbine for improving the frequency response of the system. Impacts of varying wind penetration in the system and varying active power support from DFIG on frequency control have been investigated. The presence of thyristor controlled phase shifter (TCPS) in series with the tie-line and Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) at the terminal of one area in conjunction with dynamic active power support from DFIG results in optimal transient performance for PoolCo transactions. Integral gains of AGC loop and parameters of TCPS and SMES are optimized through craziness-based particle swarm optimization (CRPSO) in order to have optimal transient responses of area frequencies, tie-line power deviation and DFIG parameters.

AB The primary objective of this investigation is to develop a new control method for wind turbines that can increase their wind energy capture efficiency. Since the resultant wind turbine system dynamics are profoundly nonlinear and coupled with significant uncertainties, traditional model-based control is found to be not only structurally complex but also computationally expensive. Here, we explore two sets of control algorithms to enhance wind to electrical energy conversion. The first accounts for system nonlinearities and external disturbances by integrating variable structure control with adaptive control. The second accommodates the nonlinearities arising from rotor aerodynamics and pitch (actuation) dynamics, as well as external disturbances, through a method inspired by a 1st order human memory/learning model. The second method allows direct maximum power coefficient tracking for winds under the rated speed and ensures rated power output for winds over the rated speed. Basically, it uses the system current and most recent memorized responses, together with past control experience, to generate new control actions. Both rotor dynamics and actuation (pitch) dynamics are reflected indirectly through the observed/measured system response at each instant, and are embedded within the control mechanism. Thus, there is no need for detailed information on the system model or system parameters in the control's design and implementation. The efficacy of both proposed approaches is analyzed through numerical simulations. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3696072]

AB This study addresses the problem of controlling a variable-speed wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), modelled as an electromechanically coupled non-linear system with rotor voltages and blade pitch angle as its inputs, active and reactive powers as its outputs, and most of the aerodynamic and mechanical parameters as its uncertainties. Using a blend of linear and non-linear control strategies (including feedback linearisation, pole placement, uncertainty estimation and gradient-based potential function minimisation) as well as time-scale separation in the dynamics, the authors develop a controller that is capable of maximising the active power in the maximum power tracking (MPT) mode, regulating the active power in the power regulation (PR) mode, seamlessly switching between the two modes and simultaneously adjusting the reactive power to achieve a desired power factor. The controller consists of four cascaded components, uses realistic feedback signals, and operates without knowledge of the C-p-surface, air density, friction coefficient, and wind speed. Finally, the authors show the effectiveness of the controller via simulation with realistic wind profiles.

AB The objective of the paper is to develop a novel intelligent pitch control system of a 2MW wind turbine driven by variable-speed hydraulic pump-controlled system. For realizing the intelligent pitch controller, self-organizing fuzzy sliding mode control, which combines fuzzy sliding mode control and self-organizing modifier, is proposed. In order to verify the proposed concept experimentally, a full-scale test rig of the hydraulic pitch control system of a 2MW wind turbine blades, including a novel mechanism of pitch control, a variable-speed hydraulic pump-controlled system, a disturbance system and a PC-Based control system, are designed and set up. The variable-speed pump-controlled hydraulic servo system contains an AC servo motor and a constant displacement hydraulic piston pump. In order to compare the control performance, the pitch control experiments by fuzzy sliding mode control and by self-organizing fuzzy sliding mode control are implemented respectively for different path profiles and different disturbance torque. Finally, the experimental results clarify that the pitch control controlled by self-organizing fuzzy sliding mode control can perform better than that controlled by fuzzy sliding mode control.

AB Variable-speed technologies have been adopted to improve the efficiency of electricity generation in wind farms. Among these technologies, doubly-fed induction generators have widely spread and their stability issues have been experienced and analysed. In recent years, permanent-magnet synchronous generators have been also exploited, connected to the grid through full-scale converters, ensuring high flexibility, reducing losses and weight. The presence of these technologies heightens the necessity of deeply investigating wind turbine behaviour under different disturbances.
   In this paper, a small- and large-disturbance stability analysis is carried out in order to compare dynamic characteristic of wind farm equipped with the aforementioned generation technologies. To this purpose, a detailed model of wind turbine, together with relevant control schemes, is adopted for each generator of a real-sized wind farm. The compliance of the plant with fault-ride-through requirements imposed by transmission system operator is also verified. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with design and control of a new isolated wind-hydro hybrid generation system employing a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine and a constant speed squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) driven by a constant power hydro turbine feeding three-phase four-wire local loads. The proposed hybrid energy conversion system is using back to back connected pulse width modulated (PWM) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) based voltage source converters (VSCs) with a battery energy storage system (BESS) at their dc link. The ac terminals of one VSC (rotor side converter) are connected to the rotor terminals of DFIG for the maximum power tracking (MPT) through its rotor speed control. The ac terminals of the other VSC (stator side converter) are connected to the stator terminals of DFIG and SCIG and load terminals through a delta-star transformer. The stator side converter is used for the voltage and frequency control (VFC) at the stator terminals of the DFIG and SCIG. The proposed electro-mechanical system is modeled and simulated in MATLAB using simulink and sim power systems (SPS) set toolboxes. The performance of the proposed wind-hydro hybrid system is presented to demonstrate its capability of MPT, stator voltage and frequency control, harmonic elimination, load balancing, and load leveling.

AB This paper presents the development, implementation, and performance testing of a permanent-magnet generator (PMG)-based wind energy conversion system (WECS) for grid-connected applications. The grid-connected operation is constructed using the new three-phase resolution-level-controlled wavelet-modulated inverter. The output of the wind generator is fed to a switch-mode ac-dc converter, where the dc voltage is controlled to ensure extracting power from the wind under variable wind speed conditions in order to meet the grid active and reactive power demands. The resolution-level control of the grid-side inverter is designed as a current controller for adjusting active and reactive powers delivered to the grid. The proposed WECS is implemented both in software and hardware for performance testing on a direct-drive 6-kW laboratory PMG operated with variable speed. Test results demonstrate that an accurate control of the dc voltage on the generator side ensures adjusting the generator speed to extract power at each wind speed in order to meet the demand active and reactive power delivery to the grid. Also, test results show significant abilities of the resolution-level controller to initiate fast and accurate adjustments in the active and reactive powers delivered to the grid in order to follow any changes in their demand values under variable wind speed.

AB This paper proposes a strategy of flicker mitigation for doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine systems. In the weak grid system where the grid impedance ratio is low, the reactive power compensation only cannot suppress the flicker sufficiently due to the limited power capacity of the converters or the DFIG. For the full suppression of flickers, the active power smoothening using the energy storage system (ESS) needs to be utilized together with the reactive power compensation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results for a 2[MW] DFIG wind turbine system and by experimental results for a 3[kW] wind turbine simulator.

AB In wind energy conversion system, variable speed operation is becoming popular nowadays, where conventional synchronous generators, permanent magnet synchronous generators, and doubly fed induction generators are commercially used as wind generators. Along with the existing and classical solutions of the aforementioned machines used in wind power applications, the switched reluctance generator (SRG) can also be considered as a wind generator due to its inherent characteristics such as simple construction, robustness, low manufacturing cost, etc. This paper presents a novel speed control of switched reluctance generator by using adaptive neural network (ANN) controller. The SRG is driven by variable speed wind turbine and it is connected to the grid through an asymmetric half bridge converter, DC-link, and DC-AC inverter system. Speed control is very important for variable speed operation of SRG to ensure maximum power delivery to the grid for any particular wind speed. Detailed modeling and control strategies of SRG as well as other individual components including wind turbine, converter, and inverter systems are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified with simulation results using the real wind speed data measured at Hokkaido Island, Japan. The dynamic simulation study is carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an optimum seeking-based robust non-linear controller is proposed to maximise wind energy captured by variable speed wind turbines at low-to-medium wind speeds. The proposed strategy simultaneously controls the blade pitch angle and tip-speed ratio, through the turbine rotor angular speed, to an optimal point at which the power coefficient, and hence the wind turbine efficiency, is maximum. The optimal points are given to the controller by an optimisation algorithm that seeks the unknown optimal blade pitch angle and rotor speed. The control method allows for aerodynamic rotor power maximisation without exact knowledge of the wind turbine model. A representative numerical simulation is presented to show that the wind turbine can be accurately controlled to achieve maximum energy capture.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Most variable speed wind turbines have pitch control mechanisms and one of their objectives is to protect turbines when the wind speed is too high. By adjusting pitch angles of wind turbine, the inlet power and the torque developed by the turbine are regulated. In this paper, the difference between the real wind speed and its rated value is regarded as a disturbance, and a component called disturbance observer (DOB) is added to the pre-designed control loop. The additional DOB based controller estimates the disturbance and generates a compensating signal to suppress the effect of disturbance on the system. As a result, the stability and the performance of the closed loop system guaranteed by an outer-loop controller (designed for a nominal system without taking into account of disturbances) are approximately recovered in the steady state. Simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed control scheme.

AB This paper focuses on the development of a control strategy for integration of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) into the electrical distribution networks with particular attention to the combined provision of energy and ancillary services. Typically, a WECS is composed by a variable speed wind turbine coupled with a direct driven permanent magnet (DDPM) synchronous generator. This configuration offers a considerable flexibility in design and operation of the power unit, as its output is delivered to the grid through a fully controlled frequency converter. Here, a new control scheme to regulate electrical and mechanical quantities of such generation unit is proposed, aimed both at reaching optimal performances in terms of power delivered to the grid and at providing the voltage support ancillary service at the point of common coupling. The control scheme is derived resorting to the feedback linearization (FBL) technique, which allows both decoupling and linearization of a non linear multiple input multiple output system. Several numerical simulations are then performed in order to show how the flexibility of the DDPM wind generator can be fully exploited, thanks to the use of the FBL approach, which assures independent control of each variable and significant simplifications in controller synthesis and system operation, thus making it easier to integrate WECS into modern day smart grids.

DE Wind power; Variable length blade; Smart wind turbine
AB A smart wind turbine concept with variable length blades and an innovative hybrid mechanical electrical power conversion system was analyzed. The variable length blade concept uses the idea of extending the turbine blades when wind speeds fall below rated level, hence in creasing the swept area, and thus maintaining a relatively high power output. It is shown for a typical site, that the annual energy output of such a wind turbine that could double its blade length, could be twice that of a corresponding turbine with fixed length blades. From a cost analysis, it is shown that the concept would be feasible if the cost of the rotor could be kept less than 4.3 times the cost of a standard rotor with fixed length blades. Given the variable length blade turbine system exhibits a more-or-less linear maximum power curve, as opposed to a non-linear curve for the standard turbine, an innovative hybrid mechanical electrical power conversion system was proposed and tested proving the feasibility of the concept.

AB Control of variable speed wind turbines coupled with squirrel cage induction generators situated in remote areas is difficult and suffers from some fundamental problems. These systems cannot stabilize frequency and voltage of the grid in acceptable ranges. Changes in the load during 1 day and sudden changes in wind speed also make this problem harder to deal with. In this paper, a system consisting of three wind turbines integrated with two types of diesel generator connected to a variable load is analyzed, and a new multilevel control strategy is proposed. A new load model is implemented by changing power demand based on load curve. This control method adjusts a controller based on past system and environmental data. Simulations based on PSCAD/EMTDC software show the ability of the proposed control system to provide high quality power for this type of load. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores the relationship between wind generation, particularly the control of reactive power from variable speed wind turbine generators, and the rotor angle stability of the conventional synchronous generators in the system. Rotor angle stability is a dynamic phenomenon generally associated with changes in active power flows that create angular separation between synchronous units in the system. With larger penetrations of wind generation being introduced into power systems, there will be large flows of active power from asynchronous generation in the system. These asynchronous active power flows can aid in maintaining the rotor angle stability of the system. However, the manner in which wind generation injects reactive power into the system can be critical in maintaining angular stability of the synchronous units. Utilizing wind generation to control voltage and reactive power in the system can ease the reactive power burden on synchronous generators, and minimize angular separation in the system following a contingency event and can provide a significant level of support which will become increasingly important in future power systems.

AB We present two intelligent controllers for large and flexible wind turbines operating in high-speed winds, a Fuzzy-P + I and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy controller. The control objective is to regulate the rotor speed at the given rated power in region 3 (full load) via collective blade pitch angle. The modeled turbine is a three-bladed, upwind machine with a flexible blade and tower. We use the particle swarm optimization method in off-line training for our adaptive neuro-fuzzy controller. Numerical simulations are performed using wind inflow step change with a set of input-output data of a nonlinear wind turbine model. We compare the performance of the proposed controllers with the baseline PI-controller. Simulation results confirm successful performance of the proposed controllers. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4004979]

AB This paper introduces a novel cage induction generator and presents a mathematical model, through which its behavior can be accurately predicted. The proposed generator system employs a three-phase cage induction machine and generates single-phase and constant-frequency electricity at varying rotor speeds without an intermediate inverter stage. The technique uses any one of the three stator phases of the machine as the excitation winding and the remaining two phases, which are connected in series, as the power winding. The two-series-connected-and-one-isolated (TSCAOI) phase winding configuration magnetically decouples the two sets of windings, enabling independent control. Electricity is generated through the power winding at both sub- and super-synchronous speeds with appropriate excitation to the isolated single winding at any frequency of generation. A dynamic mathematical model, which accurately predicts the behavior of the proposed generator, is also presented and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. Experimental results of a 2-kW prototype generator under various operating conditions are presented, together with theoretical results, to demonstrate the viability of the TSCAOI power generation. The proposed generator is simple and capable of both storage and retrieval of energy through its excitation winding and is expected to be suitable for applications, such as small wind turbines and microhydro systems.

AB In this paper, a grid connected permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based direct drive variable speed wind turbine with a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is investigated to achieve uninterrupted operation of wind farms during grid disturbances. The wind energy system will be able to maintain uninterrupted operation during grid faults or disturbances. The control strategies for the wind energy conversion system and STATCOM with super-capacitor are implemented in Matlab/Simpower. The proposed control strategy for super capacitor based STATCOM effectively reduces the level of voltage sag, enhance the low voltage/fault ride through capability of the wind farm and mitigate the power quality issue at the point of common coupling (PCC). Results show that the STATCOM with super-capacitor energy storage can enhance the dynamic performance of the direct drive wind energy system.

A control strategy with maximum power extraction for the generator side dc to dc converter is proposed. The generator speed is regulated under fluctuating wind speed through this converter. A dc link voltage controller is used to regulate the dc bus voltage under fluctuating wind and grid disturbance. Control strategy for active and reactive power flow to the grid is developed to transfer power to the grid through the vector controlled IGBT inverter. A simulation model for the proposed wind energy conversion system together with its controller is implemented in Matlab/Simpower environment. Simulation results confirm that proposed controllers for the wind energy conversion system worked well under fluctuating wind and grid disturbance.

AB The Low-Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) has become an important grid requirement for offshore wind farms connecting with Voltage Source Converter based High Voltage Direct Current (VSC-HVDC) links. In this paper, a cooperative control strategy with LVRT ability is proposed for a VSC-HVDC connected variable speed Squirrel-Cage Induction Generator (SCIG) wind farm. The approach employs a DC-link voltage versus offshore AC-bus frequency droop control on the offshore converter of VSC-HVDC link. Thus, the back-to-back converters of SCIG wind turbines can adjust the generated active power based on the AC-bus frequency deviations, so that a fast power reduction on the wind farm side can be achieved. The EMTDC/PSCAD simulations are performed on a 300 MW offshore variable speed SCIG wind farm. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

The proposed control strategy combines a robust observer of the aerodynamic torque with a Sliding Mode (SM) based field oriented control strategy. The robust vanishing of the observation error and the tracking error is proved. Reported numerical simulations show that the proposed SM approach is effective in terms of optimal power extraction and it is robust with respect to uncertainties affecting the system.

AB Because of the environmental pollution problems and the economic benefits of fuel savings, there has been a growing interest in the renewable energy, especially wind energy power systems. There are still many unsolved challenges in expanding wind power, and there are numerous problems of interest to systems control researchers. The amount of energy obtained from a wind energy conversion system (WECS) depends not only on the characteristics of the wind regime at the site, but it also depends on the control strategy used for the WECS. In order to get the maximum power from the wind, the variable-speed wind turbine should run at different speed when wind speed changes. In this paper modeling and control scheme of the efficient mathematical methods are introduced. Models of several autonomous WECS have been developed using Matlab Simulink software. These allow easy performance evaluations and comparisons on different control strategies used in WECS.

AB Power transmission faults are one important cause of machine downtime many production activities are working to prevail. Vibration monitoring tools have achieved this role on the assumption that the stationary condition hypothesis is maintained. Several industries, including wind energy production, are however demanding to observe mechanical or electrical rotating components behaviour at variable speeds. Instantaneous angular speed measurement has been recently proven able to detect localized faults in bearings using only an encoder close from the source of the defect. This paper presents the results obtained from a large span experiment on a 2MW wind turbine. The uniqueness of the sensor used to monitor the whole line shafting along with the continuous non stationary conditions are so many difficulties cumulated on this attempt. Two basic signal processing tools are theoretically defined and experimentally applied in an original way on the Instantaneous Angular Speed measurement to efficiently tackle these practical issues.

AB The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine is a variable speed wind turbine widely used in the modern wind power industry. At present, commercial DFIG wind turbines primarily make use of the technology that was developed a decade ago. But, it is found in this paper that there is a limitation in the conventional vector control technique. This paper presents a directcurrent vector control method in a DFIG wind turbine, based on which an integrated control strategy is developed for wind energy extraction, reactive power, and grid voltage support controls of the wind turbine. A transient simulation system using SimPower-System is built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The conventional control approach is compared with the proposed control technique for DFIG wind turbine control under both steady and gust wind conditions. The paper shows that under the dc vector control configuration, a DFIG system has a superior performance in various aspects.

AB A wind farm with variable speed wind turbines usually consists of a large number of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) connected and operating simultaneously. The study of a wind farm with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (PMSG) is presented. The 30 KW wind farm consists of 3 PMSGs based 10KW generators connected to a common DC-bus. Each PMSG of the wind farm is connected to the DC-bus through a rectifier, but the DC-bus is connected to the grid through only one DC/AC inverter. The proposed control strategy is introduced aiming in both Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control method and Direct Torque Control (DTC). The PMSG side converters are used to achieve MPPT. The reference speeds of the generators are dynamically modified according to the wind speeds so as to maintain the wind turbines at maximum power operating point. The grid-side converter regulates DC-link voltage and injects the generated power into the AC network. Direct power control of PWM inverter is adopted. Grid-side reactive and active power decoupling method is applied to regulate the grid-side power factor. Simulation results confirm that the proposed strategy has excellent performance.

AB This study proposes a novel Variable Structure Direct Torque Control (VS-DTC) scheme for Wind Farm (WF) based on the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (PMSGs) in order to maximize the generated power from wind turbines. The 30KW wind farm consists of 3 PMSGs based 10KW generators connected to a common DC-bus. Each generator of the farm is connected to the DC-bus through a rectifier, but the DC-bus is connected to the grid through only one DC/AC inverter. The efficiency of the variable speed farm can be greatly improved using an appropriate control strategy. In addition, WF has strong nonlinear multivariable with many uncertain factors and disturbances. Consequently, the control strategy combines the technique of DTC and Sliding Mode (SM) nonlinear control theory. Considering the variation of wind speed, the PMSGs side converters are used to achieve Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), while the grid-side converter regulates DC-link voltage, injects the generated power into the AC network and it's used to achieve unity power factor. The employed control strategy provides an optimal control solution for wind farm systems based on the PMSG.

AB The efficiency of the Wind Farm (WF) systems can be greatly improved using an appropriate control methodology. In this paper, a control for variable speed WF that incorporates a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) is described and the so called Vector Control (VC) theory is applied. 6 PMSGs based 2MW generators connected to a common DC bus are used. Each generator is connected to the DC-bus with a rectifier while the DC-bus is connected to the grid through one DC/AC converter. The proposed control law combines Space Vector Modulation (SVM) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control strategy to maximize the generated power from Wind Turbine Generators (WTG). Also, reactive and active power can be controlled by quadrature and direct current components, respectively. Accordingly, WF system can't only capture the maximum wind energy, but also can maintain the frequency and amplitude of the output voltage with unity power factor. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for WF based on the PMSGs.

AB Noise pollution from wind turbines and blowers operating in the vicinity Of residential buildings has in recent years been the focus of intensive research. This paper reports on the outcome of an experimental investigation to reduce the noise pollution through design, build and testing of a counter-rotating-double-row-fan with variable spacing. A single-row fan was selected as the benchmark fan. The mechanical noise and the background ambient noise were measured using the system operating with no-blades. The aerodynamic noise from the fan was then focused and air velocity, shaft-revolution, input-electric-power to fan, amplitude (dB) and Center Frequency (CF) in Hz of noise were measured using frequency-weighting of both "A" and "Linear". Coefficients of performance (COP), dB, CF, Tip speed ratio (TSR) were plotted for a range of spacing between two-blade-rows. It was noticed that double-shaft-fan relative to the benchmark single shaft fan has operated
   a) At a lower TSR due to division of the motor power between two shafts.
   b) At a higher COP of up to 18% due to a higher air velocity generated at the same motor power.
   c) Quieter at a lower dB (of up to 10 dB).
   d) At the minimum noise levels (80 dB) at the spacing of 15mm-to-25mm, using the "Lin"-weighting
   e) At the minimum noise levels (20 dB) at the spacing of 12mm-to 50 mm when measured at the "A"-weighting
   f) With no significant change in frequency of noise when operate at the same TSR.

AB Most recent grid codes require wind turbines to contribute to the recovery of frequency drops in the grid. More of the recently build wind turbines use variable speed generators. Unlike fixed speed generators, these generators do not naturally contribute to the recovery of the frequency drop since the rotor rpm is decoupled from the grid frequency. This decoupling is achieved by controller and power conditioning units. The studies reviewed in this paper focused on the design of such a controller so that the wind turbine could react to frequency drops. Another approach to responding to frequency drops is to connect an energy storage system to the DC bus of variable speed generator. Flywheels have been used as energy storage systems to fill energy gaps in several applications and can be used for frequency recovery application for wind turbines as well. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the improvement of frequency stability of wind turbines connected to electrical grids in the presence of flywheel energy storage systems (FESS). Studies reviewed show that FESS can enhance the power quality and frequency stability of wind turbines connected to an electrical grid.

AB The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the possibility of improving the efficiency of wind turbines by taking advantage of the wind speed variability. An active epicycloids gearbox system allowing a variable speed at the input shaft and delivering a constant speed at the output shaft is proposed herein. The gearing system consists of an assembly of spur and ring gears run and controlled by an electrical motor. The system acts as a continuously variable transmission (CVT) between the wind turbine hub and the electricity generator which requires an entry speed corresponding to an electrical grid frequency of 60 Hz. The active gearing system is designed using CAD software, and the gearing design theory is used to dimension the proposed epicycloids system. The kinematic gearing theory is used to establish the different gearing ratios of the system, and the kinematic velocity relationships between the gearing system stages. The forces and torques acting on the gearing system are computed using the equilibrium equations. Ideally, the electrical power consumed by the regulating motor system is minimal so that a maximum percentage of the generated electrical power is supplied to the electricity grid. The advantage of this gearbox configuration is that the power consumed by the regulating motor will be theoretically close to zero when the wind speed is about 10.5 mph, which is the average wind speed for many areas where wind turbines are installed. As the wind speed moves away from its mentioned average, the gearbox electrical controls activate a regulating motor to secure a constant speed at the generator input. Currently, a prototype of the proposed system is under tests and experimental data has already shown the constancy of the angular velocity at the generator input. The measurements of the mechanical power distribution between the different components of the system are still underway. A prony-break system is currently used for this purpose. It is expected that within a defined range of the hub angular velocities, the power absorbed by the regulating motor remains a small fraction of the power delivered by the electricity generator.

AB Two optimum power transfer models of self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) have been studied with a view to validating previous findings. The first model employed a capacitor bank-load approach to optimising by sizing of shunt and shunt-series compensation capacitors for SEIG variable speed wind turbines, and the use of 50uF shunt + 45uF series capacitors in this first model was validated and supported. The second model employed an extrapolated magnetizing characteristic resulting in three curves, in which the generated voltage provides a high degree of voltage stability without changing the excitation capacitor or exceeding the generator rating. Errors were found in the best-fit coefficients presented in this second model, which are corrected, represented, and validated.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHMS
AB In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm is used to find optimized spatial configurations of wind turbines in offshore or flat terrain wind farms. The optimization is made by obtaining maximizing power output per unit cost. A wake model which permits the calculation of single wakes, multiple wakes and wake interactions is employed to estimate wind speeds at each turbine for a given external wind distribution function and a given spatial configuration. The optimization is applied to cases of unidirectional wind, variable direction winds and variable wind speed. The placement of a turbine can be set at any location following the approach of Mittal et al. Results are obtained for different spacing limits between turbines and wind farms of different sizes. The results for some patterns of optimized placements of wind turbines are discussed in the context of the wind distributions and the wake model employed

AB Most wind turbines installed have traditional architectures: double-fed asynchronous machine or direct drive with full conversion, both containing several levels of control composed of PI controllers. In our application, a robust 3rd-generation-CRONE controller is used to manage a planetary gearing ratio upstream of a synchronous generator directly connected to the grid. Thus, the speed of the low shaft is controlled and unlike other architectures, no system of power electronics is required for conversion. This CRONE approach is a robust control methodology based on fractional order differentiation.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to repair modeling using a time domain Auto-Regressive model to represent meteo-ocean site conditions. The short term hourly correlations, medium term access windows of periods up to days and the annual distribution of site data are captured In addition, seasonality is included. Correlation observed between wind and wave site can be incorporated if simultaneous data exists. Using this approach a time series for both significant wave height and mean wind speed is described This allows allows MTTR to be implemented within the reliability simulation as a variable process, dependent on significant wave height. This approach automatically captures site characteristics including seasonality and allows for complex analysis using time dependent constraints such as working patterns to be implemented A simple cost model for lost revenue determined by the concurrent simulated wind speed is also presented A preliminary investigation of the influence of component reliability and access thresholds at various existing sites on availability is presented demonstrating the ability of the modeling approach to offer new insights into offshore wind turbine operation and maintenance.
