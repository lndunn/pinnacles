AB We describe a multi-layer architecture for the control of variable speed wind turbines, whereby each control layer targets a specific goal. The proposed architecture is inspired by the multi-objective nature of the wind turbine control problem.
   Three main goals are identified and associated with three distinct control loops: a) trimming and load alleviation for large scale gusts engulfing the whole rotor disk, targeted by a collective-pitch/torque controller; b) alleviation of deterministic slowly varying and low frequency loads, targeted by a higher harmonic controller operating in the frequency domain; and c) alleviation of non-deterministic loads caused by small spatial and fast temporal wind fluctuation due to turbulence.
   The proposed control architecture is demonstrated by means of various tests conducted in a high-fidelity simulation environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A review of current progress in Condition Monitoring (CM) of wind turbine gearboxes and generators is presented, as an input to the design of a new continuous CM system with automated warnings based on a combination of vibrational and Acoustic Emission (AE) analysis. For wind turbines, existing reportage on vibrational monitoring is restricted to a few case histories whilst data on AE is even scarcer. In contrast, this paper presents combined vibration and AE monitoring performed over a continuous period of 5 days on a wind turbine. The vibrational and AE signatures for a healthy wind turbine gearbox and generator were obtained as a function of wind speed and turbine power, for the full normal range of these operational variables. i.e. 5-25 m/s and 0-300 kW respectively. The signatures have been determined as a vital pre-requisite for the identification of abnormal signatures attributable to shaft and gearbox defects. Worst-case standard deviations have been calculated for the sensor data. These standard deviations determine the minimum defect signal that could be detected within the defined time interval without false alarms in an automated warning system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a new control strategy of a stand-alone self-excited induction generator (SEIG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine. The proposed system consists of a three phase squirrel-cage induction machine connected to a wind turbine through a step-up gear box. A current controlled voltage source inverter (CC-VSI) with an electronic load controller (ELC) is connected in parallel with the main consumer load to the AC terminals of the induction machine. The proposed control strategy is based on fuzzy logic control principles which enhance the dynamic performance of the proposed system. Three fuzzy logic PI controllers and one hysteresis current controller (HCC) are used to extract the maximum available energy from the wind turbine as well as to regulate the generator terminal voltage simultaneously against wind speed and main load variations. However, in order to extract the maximum available energy from the turbine over a wide range of wind speeds, the captured energy is limited due to electrical constraints. Therefore the control strategy proposed three modes of control operation. The steady state characteristics of the proposed system are obtained and examined in order to design the required control parameters. The proposed system is modeled and simulated using Matlab/Simulink software program to examine the dynamic characteristics of the system with proposed control strategy. Dynamic simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a precise real-time wind speed estimation method and sensorless control for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbine power generation system (WTPGS). The wind speed estimation is realized by a nonlinear input-output mapping extreme learning machine (ELM). A specific design characteristic of the wind turbine is used for improving the mapping accuracy with considering the variable pitch angle. Moreover, since the design is independent of the environmental air density, the proposed ELM wind speed estimation method is robust to the air density variations. The estimated wind speed is then used to determine the optimal rotational speed command for maximum power point tracking. A fast and effective ELM mapping based pitch controller is proposed too when the WTPGS operates in its high wind speed region. The ELM pitch controller can act much faster and more precise than conventional pitch controllers. Furthermore, the complicated design precess for the parameters of conventional pitch controllers will be avoided in the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified both by simulations and experiments on a WTPGS installed with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A rotor speed predictive control algorithm has been designed to control the angular speed of the machine in order to allow the wind energy conversion system to operate with maximum power extraction. The generator torque and uncertainties are estimated and injected into the control law to improve the tracking performance. Control action is carried out assuming that all the states are known by measurement. Then, a state observer is implemented and Lyapunov method is used to prove the global stability of the complete continuous control scheme. Simulation is carried out to verify the performance of the proposed control system.

ID POWER-SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents an improved fuzzy synthetic model that is based on a real-time condition assessment method of a grid-connected wind turbine generator system (WTGS) to improve the operational reliability and optimize the maintenance strategy. First, a condition assessment framework is proposed by analyzing the monitored physical quantities of an actual WTGS with an electrically excited synchronous generator (EESG) and a full-scale converter. To examine the variable speed operational performances, the dynamic limits and the deterioration degree functions of the characteristic variables are determined by analyzing the monitoring data of the WTGS. An improved fuzzy synthetic condition assessment method is then proposed that utilizes the concepts of deterioration degree, dynamic limited values and variable weight calculations of the assessment indices. Finally, by using on-line monitoring data of an actual 850 kW WTGS, real-time condition assessments are performed that utilize the proposed fuzzy synthetic method; the model's effectiveness is also compared to a traditional fuzzy assessment method in which constant limited values and constant weights are adopted. The results show that the condition assessment that utilizes the improved method can predict the change of operating conditions and has a better coherence with real operating conditions than that of a traditional fuzzy assessment method.

AB The aim of this paper is to improve the reactive power compensation and active filtering capability of a Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). The proposed algorithm is applied to a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) with a stator directly connected to the grid and a rotor connected to the grid through a back-to-back AC-DC-AC PWM converter. The control strategy of the Rotor Side Converter (RSC) aims, at first, to extract a maximum of power under fluctuating wind speed. Then, depending on the rate power of the RSC, the power quality can be improved by compensating the reactive power and the grid harmonics current due to nonlinear loads. Hence, the RSC is controlled in order to manage the WECS function's priorities, between production of the maximum active power captured from the wind, and power quality improvement. The main goal of the proposed control strategy is to operate the RSC at its full capacity, without any over-rating, in terms of reactive power compensation and active filtering capability. Elsewhere, the Grid Side Converter (GSC) is controlled in such a way to guarantee a smooth DC voltage and ensure sinusoidal current in the grid side. Simulation results show that the wind turbine can operate at its optimum power point for a wide range of wind speed and power quality can be improved. It has been shown also that the proposed strategy allows an operating full capacity of the RSC in terms of reactive power compensation and active filtering. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy storage devices are required for power balance and power quality in stand-alone wind energy systems. Initially, the holistic model of the entire system is achieved, including the PMSG, the boost converter, and the storage system. The power absorbed by the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed wind turbine and energy storage systems, subject to an appropriate control method. The main purpose is to supply 230-V/50-Hz domestic appliances through a single-phase inverter. The simulation results, validated by experimental testing, show a good prediction of the electrical parameter waveforms. The control system is implemented on a dSPACE DS1103 real-time board. Furthermore, the results confirm the stability of the supply.

The optimization is done by controlling the pitch angle and the tip speed ratio of each one of the wind turbines in order to minimize the overall wake effect between wind turbines and, as a consequence, maximize the power produced by the facility. The optimization is performed by using a genetic algorithm with the aim of maximizing the power production. The production model considers aspects as the wind turbine power coefficient dependence on the pitch angle and the tip speed ratio as well as the influence of these variables on the wake effect performance.

AB This paper presents control strategies for combined operation of fixed speed and direct drive variable speed wind turbines connected to the grid. The system consists of a direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and a directly connected self-excited induction generator (SEIG). The wind energy system together with its controllers is implemented in Matlab/SimPowerSystem. Since SEIGs do not perform voltage regulation and absorb reactive power from the grid as they are the source of voltage fluctuations. During the faults, it is essential to determine the possible impacts on system stability when wind penetration increases. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is used to enhance the system performance during loss of generation, voltage sag, voltage swell, load change and faults. The simulation results show that the STATCOM improves the transient voltage stability and therefore, helps the system to remain in service during disturbances.

The application of DFIG in large wind energy conversion systems (WECS) has reached 55% of the worldwide total wind capacity during the year 2012. On the other side fluctuating output power, weak fault ride through capability and high sensitivity to grid disturbances are the main issues that affect DFIG performance. In this paper, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit is proposed to improve the overall performance of a DFIG-based WECS during voltage sag disturbance in the grid side. A new control approach for SMES unit using hysteresis current controller (HCC) along with proportional integral (PI) controller is introduced. Simulations results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed SMES controller in improving the overall performance of the WECS system under study.

AB Wind turbine drivetrains consist of components that directly convert kinetic energy from the wind to electrical energy. Therefore, guaranteeing robust and reliable drivetrain designs is important to minimize turbine downtime. Current drivetrain models often lack the ability to model both the impacts of electrical transients as well as wind turbulence and shear in one package. In this work, the capability of the FAST wind turbine computer-aided engineering tool, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, is enhanced through integration of a dynamic model of the drivetrain. The dynamic drivetrain model is built using Simscape in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and incorporates detailed electrical generator models. This model can be used in the future to test advanced control schemes to extend life of the gearbox.

AB Wind turbine generators (WTGs) consist of many different components to convert kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy for end users. Wind energy is accessed to provide mechanical torque for driving the shaft of the electrical generator. The conversion from wind power to mechanical power is governed by the aerodynamic conversion. The aerodynamic-electrical-conversion efficiency of a WTG is influenced by the efficiency of the blades, the gearbox, the generator, and the power converter.
   This paper describes the use of MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the electrical and grid-related aspects of a WTG coupled with the FAST aeroelastic wind turbine computer-aided engineering tool to simulate the aerodynamic and mechanical aspects of a WTG. The combination of the two enables studies involving both electrical and mechanical aspects of a WTG. For example, mechanical engineers can formulate generator control that may preserve the life of the gearbox or mitigate the impact of transient events occurring on the transmission lines (faults, voltage and frequency dips, unbalanced voltages, etc.). Similarly, electrical engineers can study the impact of high-ramping wind speeds on power systems, as well as the impact of turbulence on the voltage and frequency of a small balancing authority area. This digest includes some examples of the capabilities of the FAST and MATLAB coupling, namely the effects of electrical faults on the blade moments.

AB This paper presents a new overall control strategy for small scale wind energy conversion systems (WECS). The purpose of the proposed strategy is to utilize a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control to maximize the captured energy when the wind speeds are below the rated maximum and when the wind speeds are above the rated value, the captured power is regulated to protect the system from over-power operation. For the MPPT control, a modified perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm is utilized, where the dc side current is used as a perturbation variable and the dc link voltage slope information is used to enhance the tracking speed and stability of the proposed algorithm. For the power regulation operation during high wind speeds, the system is controlled in the stall region to limit the rotational speed of the generator. A stabilizing control loop is proposed to compensate for the stall region instability. And a new mode transfer control strategy is developed to effectively control the transfer between the two modes of operation while ensuring the system stability. A 1.5KW hardware prototype is developed and tested to prove the proposed new control strategy.

AB A detailed model of a full conversion wind turbine is presented in this paper. Most of the systems found in a modern wind turbine are included in the model and an optimal level of model complexity is achieved to allow the design, analysis and simulation of controls and subsystem interactions within a turbine under various conditions.
   Mechanical, electrical and control subsystems were modeled to achieve flexibility for future expansion and properties that can be analyzed. Beside describing the overall wind turbine (WT), simulation system integration, which couples a variety of freeware and commercial software, the paper introduces a variable speed control for wind turbine with stall power regulation. It also describes the analysis of the interactions between components which cannot be observed with a simple WT model.

AB Current-based wind turbine generator (WTG) fault detection techniques have received more and more attention in academia and industry due to their nonintrusive character and economic advantages. This paper presents a novel broadband and highly accurate and efficient synchronous sampling method for eccentricity fault detection of direct-drive WTGs (i.e., no gearbox) only using generator stator current measurements. The proposed method resamples the WTG current measurements in a way such that the variable characteristic frequencies of the excitations generated by a WTG eccentricity fault are converted to constant values. Then, the excitations generated by WTG eccentricity fault can be easily extracted by using a traditional power spectrum density (PSD) method. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for eccentricity fault detection of a direct-drive WTG operating with variable rotating speeds.

AB As the level of wind penetration increases, wind turbine technology must move from merely generating power from wind to taking a role in supporting the bulk power system. Wind turbines should have the capability to provide inertial response and primary frequency (governor) response. Wind turbine generators with this capability can support the frequency stability of the grid. To provide governor response, wind turbines should be able to generate less power than the available wind power and hold the rest in reserves, ready to be accessed as needed. In this paper, we explore several ways to control wind turbine output to enable reserve-holding capability. The focus of this paper is on doubly-fed induction generator (also known as Type 3) and full-converter (also known as Type 4) wind turbines.

   Synchronous Generator; 12-pulse rectifiers; Deadbeat Control; and
   Adaptive Predictor
AB In this paper, an Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (IPMSG) driven by a wind turbine is directly connected to multi-pulse rectifier lies in its ability to reduce the line current harmonic distortion of the generator. The rectifiers can be configured as 12-pulse rectifiers, powered by a phase shifting transformer with a number of secondary windings. Each secondary winding feeds a six-pulse diode rectifier. The dc output of the six-pulse rectifiers is connected to a voltage source inverter. The inverter is connected to the grid via an LCL-filter and the proposed control strategy for the grid-side inverter provides the highest capabilities of attenuating switching frequency components and damping the resonance. The information of wind speed and/or generator is observed from the rectified output voltage of the IPMSG for maximizing the output power of the wind turbine. Therefore, the proposed control algorithm does not require any speed sensor for wind speed. It must be noted that the construction and installation of the whole system are simple, cheap, and reliable.

DE DFIG; Distribution; Line fault; Power flow; PSAT; Transmission network
AB With increased penetration of wind power into electrical grids, DFIG wind turbines are largely deployed due to their variable speed feature and hence influencing system dynamics.
   According to grid codes issued by utilities, tripping of wind turbines following power system faults is not allowed. Besides, to provide voltage support to the grid, reactive current supply is necessary. This paper studies the power flow (PF) of two different networks, the first is a transmission network and the second is a distribution one, A wind Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) turbine is injected to these different networks.
   A line fault right through (LFRT) is applied on each network and the power flow results are given and compared, then a new solution is proposed to connect the wind turbine to the distribution network with a down transformer to not disconnect the wind turbine during the LFRT, the power system analysis toolbox (PSAT) is used in this work.

The FMPC law can be easily obtained by solving a convex optimization problem subject to several LMI conditions. Then such controller is constructed to control a variable wind turbine. For this purpose, a model predictive control approach with blade pitch and generator torque as two control inputs with the objective to control power is proposed.

AB In this paper, a control strategy for a stand alone induction generator (IG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine for use in remote area power supply is presented. The IG is excited simultaneously by a capacitor bank and a PWM rectifier. During the voltage build up process, there is a variation in the flux linkage of the induction generator. The variation of the magnetising inductance is taken into account due to saturation of the core. To achieve the main goal of the control system, which consists to keeping the DC link voltage constant regardless of the magnitude of the load power, a direct power control (DPC) technique is proposed. In DPC approach, the converter switching states are selected directly by a switching table based on the instantaneous errors between the controlled and estimated values of active and reactive power.
   The simulation calculation was achieved using MATLAB (R)-SIMULINK (R) package and results are presented to support the theoretical discussion. (C) 2010 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Doubly-fed Induction Generator (DFIG); Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRI);
   Stator Dynamic Braking Resistor (SDBR)
AB Energy is crucial component of socio-economic development of any country. Climate change, increasing energy demand and rising oil prices has fostered the use of renewable energy sources. Wind energy represents substantial potential of renewable energy resource in the world and the installed capacity of wind turbine has increased rapidly. The recent technological revolution in variable-speed wind turbines coupled to Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) has made wind energy competitive and popular. However, DFIG is sensitive to grid disturbances. This paper reports the use of stator dynamic braking resistor (SDBR) to limit the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) in order to improve the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of the system. When the grid voltage dip occurs, a stator dynamic braking resistor connected in series with the stator terminals is usually activated. In this paper the effect of the (SDBR) are studied and analyzed. Simulation results based on MATLAB/SIMULINK are discussed.

   source inverter (CCVSI)
AB In this paper we present evaluation of two pulse width modulation techniques for two level inverters employed in a grid connected wind energy conversion systems(WECS). Sine pulse width modulation is the most simple modulation technique employed for inverters. However it has disadvantages like very narrow linear range, higher total harmonic distortion value(THD) and does not make effective utilization of DC value. The other modulation technique is space vector modulation (SVPWM), which eliminates lower order harmonics and provides a lower THD, high reliability and optimized efficiency when compared sine pulse width modulation(SPWM). The induction machine here is driven by a variable speed wind turbine and AC voltage generated is rectified by the voltage source converter and stored in a DC link capacitor. Control strategy has been developed for maintaining this DC link voltage constant at a reference value. This DC voltage is further inverted and fed to grid with a current controlled voltage source inverter (CCVSI). A current control strategy for CCVSI has also been developed. The results of the developed system validates the theoretical studies.

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS; ALGORITHMS
AB This paper proposes a control strategy based on neural network to regulate the blade pitch angle and rotate speed of the wind turbine system. An affine model of wind turbine system is proposed. On the one hand, from the aerodynamic model one can know that there exists strong coupling between the wind turbine speed and the pitch angle. On the other hand, the range of pitch angle and variable pitch rate of the wind turbine system is limited. Therefore, the wind turbine system should be seen as a nonlinear system with unknown actuator dead-zone. In order to deal with this problem, a neural network controller is introduced to estimate the partial wind turbine system, and then another static network is constructed as a novel compensator to overcome the unknown dead-zone behavior of the actuator. The detailed design and analysis procedure of the proposed adaptive control scheme are presented and some statements are used to show the reasonability of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents a new methodology for optimizing the wake effect performance and, therefore, the energy captured by the wind turbines in an offshore wind farm. The optimization is done by controlling the pitch angle and the tip speed ratio of each one of the wind turbines in order to minimize the overall wake effect between wind turbines and, as a consequence, maximize the power produced by the facility. The optimization is performed by using a genetic algorithm with the aim of maximizing the power production. The production model considers aspects as the wind turbine power coefficient dependence on the pitch angle and the tip speed ratio as well as the influence of these variables on the wake effect performance.

AB This paper presents state space representation and a method of the automatic development of the small signal model of dc distribution network. The model can represent the dynamics of the converter-interfaced wind, photovoltaic generation units and energy storage system around the steady-state operating point. The presented model considers the voltages crossing capacitors, the currents through inductors, the control variables as state variables, and the variations of the wind speed, irradiance solar, loads as the control input. The whole state space equations are developed automatically. A detailed small-signal mathematical model is derived automatically by using the stamping method to analyze the small-signal stability of the system. Time-domain simulation is used to verify the method. The effects of system and controller parameters on the system performance are analyzed.

   control
AB An adaptive dynamic sliding mode pitch control strategy for the output power control of wind generation systems in above rated wind speed range is presented in this paper. The corresponding controller is designed, which consists of an adaptive dynamic sliding mode controller, virtual damping controller. These variable pitch control systems have several advantages over the traditional wind turbines, such as reduction of the mechanical stress, improve quality of electric energy and mitigate tower fore-aft vibration and gearbox vibration. Traditionally, wind turbine pitch control system using mainly proportional integral (PI) controller. However, such kind of controller does not adequately handle some inaccuracies mainly leading to non-optimal power factor. These may decrease wind turbine performances. Therefore, using robust control and additional sensors to help the controller to achieve its objects more effectively, such as adaptive sliding mode control, damping controller will allow to tuning the wind turbine rated power to improve power quality. Finally, simulation results are demonstrated to validate the proposed controllers.

DE WIND FARM; EXTREMUM SEEKING CONTROL; ENERGY CAPTURE; TORQUE CONTROL
ID POWER
AB This paper proposes a novel control approach for optimizing wind farm energy capture with a nested-loop scheme of extremum seeking control (ESC). Similar to Bellman's Principle of Optimality, it has been shown in earlier work that the axial induction factors of individual wind turbines can be optimized from downstream to upstream units in a sequential manner, i.e. the turbine operation can be optimized based on the power of the immediate turbine and its downstream units. In this study, this scheme is illustrated for wind turbine array with variable-speed turbines for which torque gain is controlled to vary axial induction factors. The proposed nested-loop ESC is demonstrated with a 3-turbine wind farm using the SimWindFarm simulation platform. Simulation under smooth and turbulent winds show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Analysis shows that the optimal torque gain of each turbine in a cascade of turbines is invariant with wind speed if the wind direction does not change, which is supported by simulation results for smooth wind inputs. As changes of upstream turbine operation affects the downstream turbines with significant delays due to wind propagation, a cross-covariance based delay estimate is proposed as adaptive phase compensation between the dither and demodulation signals.

AB This paper deals with nonlinear model based adaptive power capture control of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) using online approximator (OLA) in low-speed region. Compared with the traditional linear techniques valid only around an operating point, which may result in poor system performance and low reliability since the operating point may change with time due to the stochastic operating conditions, the developed controller in this paper is totally a nonlinear one capable of covering the whole operating range. In addition, with the aid of a two-layer neural network, we waive the requirement of system dynamics and aerodynamic torque. Furthermore, the weights of neural network are updated in an online manner, which means that no off-line training is needed. Finally, the effectiveness and merits of our proposed controller are verified on a 1.5 MW three-blade wind turbine using the FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) code developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

AB A variable electromotive-force generator (VEG), which is a modified generator with an adjustable overlap between the rotor and the stator, is proposed to improve the efficiency and/or expand the operational range of a conventional generator, with particular applications to wind turbines, hybrid vehicles, and so on. A mathematical model of the VEG is developed, and a novel prototype is designed and fabricated. The performance of the VEG with the active control system, which adjusts the overlap ratio based on the desired output power at different input speeds, is theoretically and experimentally studied. The results show that reducing the overlap between the rotor and the stator of the generator at low speeds results in a reduced torque loss of the generator and an increased rotational speed of the generator rotor.

AB Over three decades modern wind power development is characterised by huge advancements in turbine scaling, drive technology, switching rotor fixed-speed to variable-speed operation, advanced load-control and grid integration. Larger rotors per megawatt aims at much lower cost of energy (CoE) and achieving accelerated cost parity with conventional power plants. Hybrid drive from the late 1990s expanded the choice between high-speed geared and direct drive. Double fed induction generators (DFIGs) were long been predicted to lose out from permanent magnet generators (PMG), while by mid-2010 PMG-based direct drive was predicted to become the ultimate drive solution. DFIG proves more enduring than predicted, and uncertainty on future rare earths price development and fluctuations has turned medium-speed requiring smaller PMGs into a main trend. Hydraulic-drive solutions offer variable rotor speed with fixed generator speed and appear on the increase.

AB This paper proposes a new approach based on the association of backstepping control with genetic algorithm for power generation control of variable speed wind turbine under the effect of high wind. The Genetic algorithms are used to estimate the values of the pitch angel and Tip speed ratio and the backstepping control is used to calculate electromagnetic torque applied to the system to enslave the speed of the generator. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB In modern wind turbines the output power for wind speeds above the nominal wind speed is limited by the adjustment of the rotor blade angles. The adjustment is performed with the pitch system. For cost reasons, in small wind turbines simple mechanical pitch systems are used actuated by centrifugal force and thus depending on the rotor speed and the blade mass. With the help of the converter the generator torque, and as a consequence also the rotor speed, is controlled, so that the constant regulation on nominal power output above the nominal wind speed is enabled. The main difficulty using low cost centrifugal force regulators in pitch systems are determined by a variable structure mathematical description, the manufacturing tolerances, and age-related changes of dynamic properties. The nonlinear dynamics of such systems has not yet adequately been studied. In particular, no stability was verified considering the foregoing model uncertainties.

The I/O correspondence between IEC 61131 Single-Axis FBs and wind turbine controller is discussed first. In view of the Betz's law from aerodynamics, the question about rotor speed as input variable instead of wind speed has been confirmed in this paper. After a brief introduction of the turbine control systems and general control principle of wind turbine, the single-axis FBs of wind turbine are proposed. A simplified FB network is used to describe pitch and torque motion control system. The software implementation of the signal-axis FBs are illustrated finally.

AB Dynamic load is a key consideration in large scale wind turbine design. It is approved that the performance of controller can distinguish impact wind turbine loads. For strong external disturbances and inaccurately modeled of large wind turbines, In this paper, we propose model-free adaptive (Model Free Adapt, MFA) individual pitch control algorithms. The controller was developed in to mitigate the rotor unbalance structural load for variable speed wind turbine. The controller is designed from a nonlinear model of the system which takes into account the blades, shaft and tower flexibilities. Bladed software was used for the control strategy and traditional PM control strategy simulation comparison. The results show that the new control strategy can effectively stabilize wind turbine power output and reduce aerodynamic loads.

DE double-fed wind turbine; hybrid additional damping control; transient

AB Based on the traditional single power control of the doubly-fed wind generator, this paper proposes an active/reactive power hybrid control method of the doubly-fed wind generator, which associates the operation characteristics of the doubly-fed wind generator with the operating conditions of the power grid. This proposed method incorporates the power variation in the system transmission channel into the calculation of the wind generator power output, and employs the additional control function of the wind generator to increase system damping and restrain system power oscillation. At the same time, the proposed method controls the wind generator to capture the maximum wind power when it is operating at a variable speed with a constant frequency. Moreover, because the proposed method decouples the control of active and reactive power, the converter capacity can be reduced. Simulations in a 9-generator 13-bus system and results indicate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, the terminal sliding mode (TSM) control technique is used to solve the solution sought for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of wind energy conversion system. In order to realize the control strategy, the wind energy conversion system (WECS) is regarded as a part of the constructed high order system. Based on the constant tip-speed ratio (TSR), selecting the appropriate state variables and treating rotational speed as the object researched, the control scheme for the MPPT of wind turbine can be achieved by using the terminal sliding mode control technique. The simulation carried out shows that the system tracking efficiency can be greatly improved and the power factor and tip speed ratio are very close to the optimal value in this solution.

ID ACTIVE POWER FILTER
AB Wind power is one of the most important kind of renewable energies. Wind farm as a device which receives this energy needs some special conditions to work properly. The most common type of wind turbine is the variable-speed directly connected to the grid. Faults in the power system can originate the disconnection of wind farms. Dynamic voltage restore (DVR) is a custom power device used for eliminating voltage sages and swells which is the result of the faults. This paper presents a simulation model of a 12-pulse DVR using photovoltaic (PV) as a mean of providing an alternative energy source for the DVR. In this study, the design of a fuzzy logic (FL) controlled DVR are presented and extended to perform fast fault detection. A new control method for DVR is proposed by combining FL with a carrier modulated PWM inverter. Simulations were carried out using the MATLAB SIMULINK. The simulation results proved the capability of PV-based DVR in eliminating voltage sag and swell distributed system. Improving the operation of wind farm as a energy generator and stabilizing its voltage is the main result of this work.

AB In this paper, a novel maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm for variable speed wind systems is presented. In this approach variable step secand method is applied to improve the dynamic response of wind turbine MPPT which is based on incremental conductance (INC) algorithm. This method is also independent of specifications of turbine and generator. For lowering costs and improving reliability of system, the proposed maximum power track6er does not have any mechanical sensors. MPPT tracker forces the system to operate at maximum power point by appropriate control of a boost DC/DC converter. Model predictive control is used to control the boost converter. In the final stage a simple model predictive control method is employed for two-level three-phase inverter to deliver power to a load. Simulation results in MATLAB/SIMULINK validate feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper presents a novel control scheme of neutral point clamped (NPC) voltage source converter (VSC) based static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) to enhance the performance of wind farms. A novel control strategy for the STATCOM is presented by introducing a voltage equalizer for de link capacitor voltages and decoupled current controllers to produce appropriate d-q currents. The controllers for the wind energy conversion system and STATCOM are implemented in Matlab/SimPower. The performance of the proposed control scheme is compared with the traditional vector control scheme and results show that the proposed scheme for the STATCOM shows better performance. The STATCOM is also used to enhance the system performance during loss of generation, load change, three phase fault, voltage sag and swell. The simulation results show that the STATCOM with the proposed controller can improve the steady state and dynamic responses, and enhance the system performance during various disturbances.

AB In the variable-speed generation system, the wind turbine can be operated at maximum power operating points by adjusting the shaft speed optimally. This paper presents a novel maximum power point tracking (MPPT) based control of interior permanent magnet synchronous generator (IPMSG) incorporating loss minimization algorithm. In the proposed method, without requiring the knowledge of wind speed, air density or turbine parameters, MPPT algorithm generates optimum speed command for speed control loop of vector controlled machine side converter. The MPPT algorithm uses the estimated active power output of the generator as its input and generates command speed so that maximum power is transferred to the dc-link. Additionally proposed control system incorporates loss minimization algorithm (LMA) to improve the efficiency. The performance of the proposed adaptive MPPT and LMA based control of IPMSG for WECS is tested in simulation at different wind speed conditions.

AB This paper proposes a novel discrete-time direct-torque and flux control (DTFC) scheme for a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) used in a variable-speed direct-drive wind power generation system. The proposed DTFC does not rely on machine parameters, such as the inductances and permanent-magnet flux linkage, while the main advantages of the DTC, e.g., fast dynamic response and no need of coordinate transform, are preserved. The stator flux linkage is estimated by an adaptive low-pass filter (LPF), in which a variable cutoff frequency is used. The adaptive LPF stator flux observer can achieve high estimation precision over a wide operating range of the PMSG. A space-vector modulation (SVM) module is integrated into the control scheme of the PMSG to achieve a fixed switching frequency as well as lower flux and torque ripples when comparing with the conventional DTC. The overall control scheme is simple to apply and is robust to parameter uncertainties and variations. The effectiveness of the proposed discrete-time DTFC scheme is verified by simulation and experimental results on a 2.4-kW PMSG used in a variable-speed direct-drive wind turbine system.

   Model Predictive Control
AB Due to the development of technology and a great demand of energy, researchers try to discover energy sources with lower pollution, so the use of wind power for generating electricity has been increasing over last few decades. Nowadays, controller design for a variable speed variable pitch wind turbine is one of the most challenges for engineers.
   In this paper, a multivariable control strategy based on multiple model predictive control techniques for the control of variable speed pitch regulated wind turbines in the above-rated wind speed (full region) is proposed. Pitch angle and generator torque are controlled to reduce loads by producing a rated generator power and turbine speed.
   The advantages of this control structure are to consider the multivariable nature of the system and using a multiple model structure to deal with the nonlinearity in the system.
   A 2MW wind turbine is considered to show the good performances brought by the proposed approach by presenting and discussing the simulation results.

ID SPEED
AB Spatial distribution of the wind field exerts unbalanced loads on wind turbine structures and it is shown these loads could be mitigated by controlling each blade's angle individually (individual pitch control). In this work the problem of individual pitch control of a variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbine in the full load region is considered. Model predictive control (MPC) is used to solve the problem. A new approach is proposed to simplify the optimization problem of MPC. We linearize the obtained nonlinear model for different operating points which are determined by the effective wind speed on the rotor disc and take the wind speed as a scheduling variable. The wind speed is measurable ahead of the turbine using LIDARs, therefore the scheduling variable is known for the entire prediction horizon. We consider uncertainty in the wind propagation, which is the traveling time of wind from the LIDAR measurement point to the rotor. An algorithm based on wind speed estimation and measurements from the LIDAR is devised to find an estimate of the delay and compensate for it before it is used in the controller. Comparisons between the MPC with error compensation, without error compensation and a benchmark cyclic pitch PI controller are given. The results show that with appropriate signal processing techniques, LIDAR measurements improve the performance of the wind turbine controller.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive study on the wind power impact with increasing penetration on frequency stabilization in restructured power system scenario. The focus of the study is on faster and smoother settlement of frequency and tie-line power. A large penetration of wind power generation causes imbalance in power system because of its intermittent output. The wind power generation system does not provide inertia and isolates from the grid during disturbances but this possibility becomes milder if wind power generators also contribute to system inertia. The proposed control scheme with fuzzy logic uses frequency deviations to provide fast active power support, which blocks the fall in frequency and tie-line power during transient conditions. The simulation studies have been conducted in a two-area interconnected power system in restructured environment.
