AB This paper analyzes nonlinear dynamics and stability in a network of fixed-speed induction generators. A typical example of the network appears in windfarms that have recently attracted a lot of interest as an alternative renewable energy resource with large capacity. In this paper, we derive a mathematical model representing nonlinear dynamics occurring in the induction generator network and then present a phenomenon of nonlinear instability. The dynamical mechanism of the phenomenon is discussed in terms of collective variables and mode decomposition.

AB The maximum power point tracking technique is applied in wind power generation system to improve the utilization of wind energy. A review of existing maximum power point tracking methods is presented in this paper, based on which an intelligent maximum power point tracking is developed by the authors to improve the system performance and to facilitate the control implementation. The developed maximum power point tracking algorithm adopts variable duty cycle step size to maximize the output power of the wind generator, without the need for either knowledge of wind turbine characteristics or the measurements of mechanical quantities such as wind speed and turbine rotor speed. System simulation results have confirmed the functionality and performance of this method.

AB This paper presents the modeling and control of a Continuously Variable Planetary (CVP) transmission in a wind turbine system. The primary purpose of this paper is to evaluate its effectiveness for mechanically decoupling the variable speed turbine rotor from the grid tied induction generator. It is expected that a CVP controlled wind turbine can take advantage of the grid tied induction generator without the use of an inverter, while optimizing the blade speed aerodynamically. This system also expands its operating range making it possible to track the optimal tip speed ratio over a wider wind speed range, which allows higher power to be captured from the wind. System characteristics have been studied by simulating an 8kW horizontal axis wind turbine in a MatLab/Simulink (R) environment. Experimental results have been included to verify the model of the system. Analyses conducted show that the continuously variable transmissions are potential candidates for small wind turbine applications.

AB When the wind speed is above the rated value, the traditional control strategy is variable pitch control, and the control method is PI control. However, variable pitch wind turbines have strong nonlinear characteristics due to the natural wind which random changes with time and space. For the pitch angle control agencies in the large wind turbines, the bp neural network controller is designed and the controller of the FPGA-based hardware problem is discussed. The analysis of the neural network controller features reconstructed is presented by its three major reconfiguration units. The controller can be established based on the SG/Simulink. The simulation results show that the FPGA-based neural network controller can keep the constant output of wind turbine power, the working efficiency of the variable pitch servo system is improved, and a better idea is provided for the hardware implementation of the neural network in the wind energy conversion system.

AB This paper deals with design and control of a connected wind energy generation system employing a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine feeding single-phase loads. The proposed energy conversion system makes use of asymmetric NPC five level inverter. The dc terminal of the generator connected rectifier is tied to a boost converter for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) operation. An energy storage device is used to absorb the excess power generated from the wind turbine, and also to regulate the dc bus voltage. A pitch angle control is integrated to reduce the power generated from the wind when the battery SOC reaches 90%. The output voltage is tracked to its reference voltage in order to feed ac local loads. The proposed system is modeled and simulated using Simulink/Simpower of Matlab. The performance of the proposed system is presented, MPPT capability, dc and ac voltage regulation are also demonstrated.

In the back-to-back converter, the failure in switching devices may occur either in a machine side converter (MSC) or in a grid side converter (GSC), which decreases the generator output power and degrades the stability in wind power generation system. To detect such a fault, the second-order harmonic components of the q-axis current are monitored in the MSC as well as in the GSC. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the comparative simulation results are presented.

AB the use of wind energy has developed significantly worldwide. Wind power is the strongest growing form of renewable energy, ideal for a future with pollution-free electric power. But the intermittent nature of wind makes it difficult to forecast. The researchers have embarked on use of the Multi-Layered Perceptrons (MLP) neural networks and other architectures of neural networks for predicting the actual wind speed from the previous values of the same variable. Several algorithms are then supplied with the data to establish the relationship between the inputs and the output. The obtained results indicate that the identified model can successfully be used, but with a poor accuracy prediction of the wind speed and the Forecasting error increases as we go far dates (hours or minutes) of learning data. In this work a new neural networks approach is developed for predicting the actual wind speed from the previous values of the same variable. Model parameters are estimated from a set of past available data, and they are regularly updated during online operation by accounting for any newly available information. The learning involves physical changes of the connections between neurons. The association between several neural structures, with a specific function, allows the emergence of a higher-order function for all. If the neural network can not monitor the physical changes over time we opt for a dynamic learning over time. Finally, we present a mathematical foundation for our approach.

AB This paper deals with the robust control of variable speed, pitch regulated for a modeling two-mass gear train wind turbine. It is well know that the mechanisms are investigated in term of the most proposed assumptions to deal with the damping, shaft stiffness and inertia effect of the gear. The existing control techniques do not take into account the dynamical aspect of the wind and the turbine, which leads to significant power losses, besides, they are not robust. A control structure based on a nonlinear sliding mode control approach is presented, where we show the design methodology for a class of linear saturated systems. The effectiveness and the merit of the proposed approach are shown by simulation results.

AB In this paper the results are presented of experiments to prove an innovative concept for passive torque control of variable speed wind turbines using fluid power technology. It is demonstrated that by correctly configuring the hydraulic drive train, the wind turbine rotor operates at or near maximum aerodynamic efficiency for below rated wind speeds. The experiments with a small horizontal-axis wind turbine rotor, coupled to a hydraulic circuit, were conducted at the Open Jet Facility of the Delft University of Technology. In theory, the placement of a nozzle at the end of the hydraulic circuit causes the pressure and hence the rotor torque to increase quadratically with flow speed and hence rotation speed. The rotor torque is limited by a pressure relief valve. Results from the experiments proved the functionality of this passive speed control concept. By selecting the correct nozzle outlet area the rotor operates at or near the optimum tip speed ratio.

AB In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of a wind turbine under blade pitch angle and shaft speed sensor faults as well as pitch actuator faults. A land-based NREL 5MW variable speed pitch reg- ulated wind turbine is considered as a reference. The conventional collective blade pitch angle controller strategy with independent pitch actuators control is used for load reduction. The wind turbine class is IEC-BII. The main purpose is to investigate the severity of end effects on structural loads and responses and consequently identify the high-risk components according to the type and amplitude of fault using a servo-aero-elastic simulation code, HAWC2. Both transient and steady state effects of faults are studied. Such information is useful for wind turbine fault detection and identification as well as system reliability analysis. Results show the effects of faults on wind turbine power output and responses. Pitch sensor faults mainly affects the vibration of shaft main bearing, while generator power and aerodynamic thrust are not changed significantly, due to independent pitch actuator control of three blades. Shaft speed sensor faults can seriously affect the generator power and aerodynamic thrust. Pitch actuator faults can result in fully pitching of the blade, and consequently rotor stops due to negative aerodynamic torque.

AB Due to the increasing penetration of wind energy into power systems, it becomes critical to reduce the impact of wind energy on the stability and reliability of the overall power system. In precedent works, Shen and his co-workers developed a re-designed operation schema to run wind turbines in strong wind conditions based on optimization method and standard PI feedback control, which can prevent the typical shutdowns of wind turbines when reaching the cut-out wind speed. In this paper, a new control strategy combing the standard PI feedback control with feedforward controls using the optimization results is investigated for the operation of variable-speed pitch-regulated wind turbines in strong wind conditions. It is shown that the developed control strategy is capable of smoothening the power output of wind turbine and avoiding its sudden showdown at high wind speeds without worsening the loads on rotor and blades.

AB From extensive application over a number of years, it has been established that the nonlinear rotor aerodynamics of typical medium and large wind turbines exhibit an effectively global separability property, in other words the aerodynamic torque of the machine can be defined by two independent additive functions. Two versions of the separability of aerodynamic torque for variable speed wind turbines are investigated here; the separated function, related to wind speed, in the first version is only dependent on that variable and not rotor speed and in the second version is only dependent on tip speed ratio. Both provide very good approximations to the aerodynamic torque over extensive neighbourhoods of T-0, at least from 0 to 2T(0).

AB The influence of constant speed wind turbine in an electrical network during torque impact can lead various problems. The disturbances affect active power quality, reactive power and r.m.s. phase to phase voltage. In this paper, we propose an original system and control to solve firstly, the problems due to the brutal impact of active power and secondly the control of reactive power. The principle of the proposed wind energy system with STATCOM-supercapacitors energy storage is to limit the rapid variation of active power and give the required reactive power compensation to the induction machine during the torque change. The supercapacitor is directly coupled to the common dc-link of the whole bidirectional DC-AC converter. The control strategy of the STATCOM use a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) technic to regulate the currents injected or absorbed by the inverter. The same strategy is used to control the variable DC supercapacitor voltage. The simulation results of the STATCOM using a state-feedback with integral controller for i(d), i(q) currents converter and a simple proportional (K-p) controller cascaded to d axis current loop for DC voltage source are presented and discussed.

AB This study puts forth a multi-objective optimization of the efficiency and power density of a low speed Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) synchronous generator with the output power and rated speed amplitude of 1 kW and 100 rpm. Firstly, a brief review of different AFPM machine topologies has been provided and double sided interior slotted stator (known as TORUS-S) structure has been selected as the most suitable structure for the current application. The optimization problem was formulated by means of general sizing equations and then genetic algorithm was utilized. Innovatively, this study introduces a novel fitness function as its original contribution which offers a tool for ascertaining the priority of objective functions. This fitness function includes two variables whereby an increase in either of them leads to more improvement in one of the objective functions than in the other. The merits of this method are especially palpable in situations where it is necessary to prioritize the objective functions as is indeed the case with generators used in wind turbines which should have not only a high efficiency but also a reduced weight and volume. Finally, the results are verified through the three dimensional Finite Element Method.

AB Fast response of doubly fed induction generators is very important for grid synchronization where they are used for electrical energy generation in wind units with variable speed turbine. Predictive rotor control method is proposed in this paper. The cost function based predictive control is used to control the torque and flux of the rotor. A novel torque ripple reduction method is proposed. Therefore, the mechanical tension of the turbine will be reduced. Rotor winding is supplied with a back to back converter in order to achieve the best performance of the predictive control. The validity of the proposed method is examined by means of simulations. The results prove the fast dynamic performance of the proposed control system.

Two cases were considered. In the first case, variable speed wind turbines were connected in the wind park. For the second case, only fixed speed wind turbines were considered. The results obtained could help understand the transient and dynamic phenomena in fixed speed wind parks attending to grid network disturbances. This can be done by including some variable speed wind turbines in order to achieve stability during periods of dynamic and transient conditions. Thus, wind parks composed of both types of wind turbines could be promising in the near future.

The analysis is focused on low-cost and effective maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the wind power system while satisfying the load requirements and ensuring battery protection. Dynamic simulation results of the proposed system validate its suitability for providing reliable power supply under load and wind speed variations in isolated locations.

AB this paper is devoted to study the conversion of renewable energy resources into electrical energy in a stand-alone hybrid power generation system. The hybrid system consists of a 230 kW wind turbine, a 30 kW micro-turbine and solar heaters of double-parallel flow. Solar heaters are being used to partially preheat the air entering the combustion chamber of the micro-turbine in order to decrease the amount of fuel consumption. The dynamic behavior and simulation results are being discussed to extract the maximum energy obtained from a variable speed wind power generation system. The hybrid model has been simulated under several wind speed conditions. A supervisory controller is designed that was able to manage between the maximum energy captured from the wind turbine and the generated energy by the microturbine to meet the load demands and wind power fluctuation due to wind speed variation. Solar heaters saved amount of fuel on average 15.4 U.S. Dollars/hr monthly according to the data provided in the year 2013.

AB The effective inertia of the power system would reduce if the penetration of variable speed wind farms (WFs) increases. The case becomes more serious in a weak grid, which can cause instability issues. As a result, WFs are usually required to provide inertia response by some grid codes. This paper analyzes small signal stability (SSS) of the weak power system connected with the inertia tuned WF based on systematic nonlinear simulations and modal analyses. As indicated in this paper, the inertia tuned WF improves the frequency response of the system. At the same time, the WF remarkably engages in the power oscillations and induces a new critical oscillation mode, which threatens SSS of the system. To avoid the instability problem, a cost-effective damping controller based on the local signal is also proposed for the inertia tuned WF. The simulation results show that the controller can help to stabilize the system without affecting the frequency support capability of the WF.

AB Due to many advantages such as simple construction, low cost, no synchronization and variable speed operation etc., induction machines are emerging as a potential candidate as a generator in a wind energy conversion system. However the major drawback of its operation as a generator is its reactive power requirements. Therefore when such generators are connected into a power network, result into an excessive import of reactive power along with sudden disturbance. Therefore, in the present paper, an attempt has been made to investigate behavior of induction generator during integration as well as during the load disturbances across power network Matlab/simulink model as developed is used to analyze such effects. Further distribution of load is shown through simulation. The simulated results as obtained are used to tackle such issues effectively.

AB The focus of this paper is to design an active control system that can regulate pitch angle (angle at which blade rotates around its own axis) of the turbine blade. It will vary the mechanical torque input to the generator of a wind energy conversion system and in turn control the power extracted from the wind at a particular wind speed. A small change in pitch has effect on the extraction of available energy, reduction of torque and output power variation to the grid. In this paper a fuzzy-PI control system is modeled and the oscillation in grid power due to change in pitch position is analyzed. Furthermore it is shown that fuzzy-PI offers limited output power oscillation when compared to conventional PI controller.

AB Residential generation of electricity from renewable sources has grown substantially owing to active governmental stimulation programs in many countries. Permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) are a preferable solution for residential wind turbines (WTs) due to their high efficiency and reliability. In the design of grid integration equipment, PMSG-based WTs need special attention because of their variable-speed-variable-voltage nature. This paper reviews current trends in residential wind energy conversion systems based on the PMSG. Specific focus is on the design standards, PMSG-based WTs technology, typical power electronics building blocks, maximum power point tracking, and control systems for grid integration.

AB The utilization of wind generation equipment, such as DFIGs (double fed induction generators), interconnected to islanded power generation and distribution systems is investigated in order to determine their effects on the overall system operating characteristics and stability. The use of a stable power station (with high speed machines) will be critical in achieving fast and reliable transient response to network events, in particular, when large transient loads are expected on a continuous basis, i.e., industrial mining and mineral processing equipment. Simulation results of this paper assist in understanding how small power stations and wind generation equipment respond to large transients in an islanded network. In particular, detailed simulations and analyses will be presented on impacts of distributed wind generation units (1.5 MW DFIG) on the stability of a small weak network. The novelty of this paper is on detailed analyses and simulation of weak, islanded networks with interconnects DFIG's including their impacts on system stability under various transient operating conditions.

AB Current grid codes request the wind turbines (WTs) to have a decent level of fault ride through (FRT) capability and also participate in recovering the network stability following contingencies. Modern WTs are mostly equipped with power converters that allow them to control the output power under various operating conditions. However, there are some Fixed Speed Induction Generators (FSIGs) still operating. FSIGs have simple and economic construction. But under fault, they are very susceptible to rotor overspeed that may lead to disconnection from the grid. For variable speed WTs, application of power converters can improve the controllability of the turbines but modifications in their PQ capability are needed to meet the network requirements. This paper is aimed to investigate the impacts of connecting full converter wind generators (FCWGs) to improve FRT capability of FSIGs within a weak network. The implemented reactive power supports set in Danish and Australian Grid Codes will be assessed based on their influences on the FRT capability of FSIGs. Impacts of FCWGs locations as reactive power providers and fault durations on the FRT capability of FSIGs will also be discussed. Results confirm that FRT capability of FSIGs can be improved in accordance with enhanced capability of FCWGs.

ID MODEL
AB This paper presents a new method for estimation of energy cost for grid-connected small wind power systems (SWPSs), which integrates the wind resources, turbine power curves, system component losses and costs, and reliability into a comprehensive model. For each of these aspects, models were established. Various structural options of small wind power system components at both fixed speed and variable speed operation were considered. Through Monte-Carlo based simulations, a statistical estimation of energy costs of a typical 30kW small wind power system was obtained for the life cycle operation. The simulation results can give consumers an overview of how much they need to invest for a small wind power system during its installed lifetime. Furthermore, the results of different structural options can serve as a lookup table to provide the cost effectiveness of different structural types of small wind power systems, and also provide a benchmark for future research works on energy cost evaluation.

AB The design of a variable structure sliding-mode controller (SMC) for a variable speed wind turbine with double-fed induction-generator, based on the fuzzy logic, is described in this paper. The purpose of this controller is to maximize the energy capture by operating the turbine at the optimal rotational speed as well as fast and stable generator response. The dynamics of both the turbine and the generator are modeled to exhibit their mechanical/electrical characteristics. Two global sliding-mode controllers, which eliminate the reaching phase of SMC and the sliding-mode motion starts from the beginning, are designed to guarantee the robust tracking of both the optimal blade-rotor speed and the reference generator torque/flux in the whole process, despite the parametric uncertainty and external disturbance. To reduce the adverse chattering effect of the conventional SMC, the adaptive fuzzy inference strategy is adopted to deduce the adjustable switch gain, instead of the fixed gains. Simulation results show that the proposed controller achieves global asymptotic tracking, satisfied torque/flux responses, and has better performance and higher utilization ratio of wind energy than the conventional feedback-linearization method.

AB Recent developments of offshore power grid demonstrations in European waters at substantial distances from the onshore grid have accelerated the demand to look at high voltage DC power transmission (HVDC) as an alternative topology to traditional high voltage AC methods [1]. Current VSC-HVDC technology can realise the integration of a centralised power converter to control the speed of a cluster of turbines, thus reducing the number of power converters from the farm and therefore potentially increasing reliability and lowering power loss. This paper will primarily concentrate on the benefits of variable frequency operation of a wind farm using a centralised VSC-HVDC converter and comparing its performance to 50 Hz Type 4 wind turbines. The analysis will incorporate measured wind data form Irish offshore locations and will provide a detailed power loss methodology for the wind farm components with annual energy capture results for both variable and fixed frequency approaches.

AB This paper presents the powers control of a variable speed wind turbine (WT) device based on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). Indeed, to increase the efficiency of the WT system, a robust variable structure control has been applied. DFIG has been previously presented in several works with diverse control diagrams using generally conventional PI controllers. Nevertheless, this type of controllers does not sufficiently handle some of WT resource characteristics such as wind fluctuations effects. Indeed, these can reduce WT performances. Furthermore, DFIG parameter variations should be accounted for. In this context, this paper proposes a high-order sliding mode to control the WT DFIG. Simulation results show that the proposed approach presents attractive features such as chattering-free behavior, good response to speed variations and robustness against machine parameter variations compared to the conventional first order sliding mode technique and even fuzzy sliding mode one.

DE wind power system; pitch-angle; chattering free; sliding mode control
AB The power generated by wind turbines appears to be instable at high rate speed due to the stochastic nature of wind speed, system lagging and nonlinearities, and involving time-variable parameters. To improve the dynamic performance in the operation region of constant power output, a sliding mode variable structure controller based on the analysis of the features model of the variable pitch and the speed wind turbine generator system is proposed. Moreover, to eliminate the chattering problem caused by the sign function in the traditional controllers, a quasi-sliding mode controller within the boundary layer is introduced. The pitch control model of a 2MW permanent magnet direct-drive wind power system is built and simulated. The simulation results show that the sliding mode control with quasi sliding mode can cope with traditional chattering problems in variable structure systems, and has such advantages as strong robustness to changes in parameters and fast response.

AB Wind turbines require methods to predict the power produced as inflow conditions change. We compare the standard method of binning with a turbulence renormalization method and a machine learning approach using a data set derived from simulations. The method of binning is unable to cope with changes in turbulence; the turbulence renormalization method cannot account for changes in shear other than by using the the equivalent wind speed, which is derived from wind speed data at multiple heights in the rotor disk. The machine learning method is best able to predict the power as conditions change, and could be modified to include additional inflow variables such as veer or yaw error.

AB Load reduction is increasingly seen as an essential part of controller and wind turbine design. On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the pitch actuator requirements vary. The smart rotor pitch actuator has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This bene fit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the pitch actuator and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies.

AB Variable speed wind turbine is a complex and nonlinear system, a sophisticated control is required to meet the challenges posed by these systems. This paper is presenting a pitch regulation strategy based on LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) to regulate turbine at its rated power and to reject the effect of disturbance acting on its rotor blades by wind. CART2 (Control Advanced Research Turbine) linear model is produced/generated by FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence) code to test its simulation on MATLAB/Simulink and various results are compared. The designed controller provide better disturbance rejection performance as compared to PID controller.

AB This work presents a novel framework for the aerodynamic design and optimization of blades for small horizontal axis wind turbines (WT). The framework is based on a state-of-the-art blade element momentum model, which is complemented with the XFOIL 6.96 software in order to provide an estimate of the sectional blade aerodynamics. The framework considers an innovative nested-hybrid solution procedure based on two metaheuristics, the virtual gene genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm, to provide a near-optimal solution to the problem. The objective of the study is to maximize the aerodynamic efficiency of small WT (SWT) rotors for a wide range of operational conditions. The design variables are (1) the airfoil shape at the different blade span positions and the radial variation of the geometrical variables of (2) chord length, (3) twist angle, and (4) thickness along the blade span. A wind tunnel validation study of optimized rotors based on the NACA 4-digit airfoil series is presented. Based on the experimental data, improvements in terms of the aerodynamic efficiency, the cut-in wind speed, and the amount of material used during the manufacturing process were achieved. Recommendations for the aerodynamic design of SWT rotors are provided based on field experience.

AB Nowadays, the proportion of wind turbines and the dimensions of wind plants have increased significantly all over the world. This paper describes a comparison of the power quality for wind power systems based on three different popular wind generators: the squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG), the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and the permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). Although a fixed speed system is more simple and reliable, it severely limits the energy output of a wind turbine and power quality. In case of variable speed systems, comparisons shows that generator of similar rating can significantly enhance energy capture as well as power quality. The performances of these wind turbines and their characteristics are analyzed in steady-state. Simulation results matched well with the theoretical turbines operation.

AB A micro-grid consisting of a 300kW wind turbine and a 40kW photovoltaic array is investigated under extreme operating gust (EOG) wind scenarios. The micro-grid is connected to the 380-V utility through a utility-side converter using natural-frame control, which provides a constant voltage of the DC link between the micro-grid and utility. The impact of the extreme gust wind variations on the micro-grid performance is studied for variable speed wind energy system equipped with a squirrel-cage induction generator. The Hurghada city, Red Sea, Egypt is taken as a case study for the wind speed profile. A detailed model of extreme gust-wind speed variation is implemented and simulated using PSIM commercial software package, based on climate characteristics of Hurghada city. The indirect rotor field oriented control (FOC) method is implemented to the generator-side converter to keep the system stable under the extreme gust wind conditions and to control the squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) speed for maximum power-point tracker (MPPT) regime. Power quality of the utility-side converter in terms of operation at different power factors, voltage value and THD are verified.

Important equations governing on the stand-alone structure has been discussed and then the control loops of Rotor Side Converter (RSC) and Load Side Converter (LSC) are analyzed and designed. Two methods of direct and indirect stator voltage control method are also introduced and compared, and due to advantages of direct voltage control method, this method has been used. during the system's changes, voltage and frequency of the stator is stabilizes and regulated on a constant value by using vector control method and selecting the stator flux rotating frame. Finally, two simulation scenarios are employed to verify the designed controlling structures. In these simulations, the stator voltage and frequency stability for the changes in rotor speed and changes in the local load, has been analyzed.

AB The optimum management of a wind system involves capturing a maximum energy at a significantly variable wind speed. This requires the control of both speed and torque of wind turbine and adapting the generator load to the wind speed. The main objective of this work is determining the RPM corresponding to the maximum energy given by wind turbine. By simulation, is determined the mechanical angular speed at which the energy is maximally, considering a variable wind speed.

AB The United States Eastern Interconnection (EI) has been going through some profound changes due to the increasing penetration of wind power in this bulk grid, including the worsening of the frequency response and inter-area oscillation. However, the fast response speed of electronics devices makes it possible that the kinetic energy stored and/or wind power reserve (if it exists) in variable-speed wind generators could be injected into the power grid in a fast manner. This portion of fast-injected active power could contribute to frequency regulation or oscillation damping of the EI significantly if implemented with appropriate control schemes. In this chapter, a user-defined wind electrical control model with fast active power controllers is built in PSS (R) E. Then, based on the 16,000-bus EI system dynamic model, the potential contributions of variable-speed wind generators to the EI frequency regulation and oscillation damping are evaluated respectively. Simulation results have demonstrated that current and future penetrations of wind generation are promising in providing frequency regulation and oscillation damping in the EI.
