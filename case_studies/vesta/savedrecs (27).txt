AB This paper focuses on a robust power generation control strategy for a variable speed wind energy conversion system. The proposed control strategy, by a robust observer of the aerodynamic torque, produces the required generator electromagnetic torque. The robust ultimate boundedness of the observation error and the tracking error, with arbitrary precision, is proved. The proposed sliding mode control approach has been validated on a l. S-MW three-blade wind turbine using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine simulator FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) code. Reported numerical simulations show that the proposed control solution is effective in terms of optimal power extraction and it is robust with respect to disturbances affecting the system.

AB This paper presents the experimental results of variable speed wind power generation system (VSWPGS) using permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The back to back PWM converters are utilized as converters for the VSWPGS. The experimental results are obtained by the test bench using the wind turbine emulator. The wind turbine emulator are reproduced the behaviors of windmill by the servo motor drives. The mechanical torque reference to derive the servo motor is calculated from windmill wing profile, the wind velocity and windmill rotational speed. The VSWPGS using PMSG employs the vector control system to control the torque and speed of PMSG in the converter side. The windmill rotational speed is controlled to maximize the efficiency of wind turbine against wind speed in low-and middle-range. When the wind speeds exceeds the rated value, the windmill rotational speed and output power are controlled to be the rated values by the pitch angle control system. And the active power and reactive power are controlled in the inverter side, and generated power is sent to the grid-connected power generation while controlling the DC link voltage to be constant at the same time.

AB In this study, power factor correction rectifier is proposed for wind turbines with three phase permanent magnet synchronous generators to provide maximum energy conversion efficiency. Reference values for the rectifier are controlled by a fuzzy logic based algorithm to track maximum power point of the wind turbine which varies with turbine characteristics, wind speed, temperature, etc. The proposed maximum power point tracking algorithm removes the requirement of knowledge about the wind generator optimal power characteristics, or measurement of the wind speed, and provides variable speed operation of wind turbine. Therefore, wind energy conversion system with higher reliability, lower complexity and cost, and less mechanical stress are obtained. Maximum power point tracking algorithm and phase locked loop circuit determining the current reference values are determined, and PI regulators are used to control of the DC voltage and line currents of the rectifier. Three level neutral point clamped rectifier topology is used as main converter. Because this topology does not require isolated DC sources and power switch modules for a leg of the rectifier are commercially available, design and implementation of the neutral point clamped rectifier is simple. Simulation results show that proposed rectifier tracks the maximum power point of the wind turbine either in variable frequency and power levels. Also line currents of the rectifiers are in same phase and frequency with permanent magnet synchronous generator voltage. In addition, THD levels of the rectifier input currents and power factor are obtained as <5% and 0.99, respectively.

AB This paper presents a simple control strategy for a variable speed wind energy conversion system with a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). PMSG is connected to the grid through a switch mode rectifier and a voltage source inverter. The grid should be supplied by certain levels of powers for certain times from wind energy system according to a certain schedule. Batteries bank is connected to the DC-link voltage through a DC-DC bidirectional converter to maintain the DC voltage at constant value. Also it is used to make batteries bank stores a surplus of wind energy and supplies this energy to the grid during the wind power shortage. Voltage source inverter, at the grid side, uses a relatively complex vector control scheme to supply power at unity power factor into the grid. Simulation results have been performed using MATLAB/SIMULINK. It demonstrates that the controller performs very well in spite of variation in wind speed and demanded grid power. Also, maximum power extraction from wind turbine can be achieved through the switch mode rectifier control at the generator side.

AB Wind energy, being a clean and renewable source, is becoming more popular day-by-day. Wind energy is also economical and feasible in areas where electricity is not available due to high cost of distribution. The main disadvantage of wind power has been its unreliable nature which results in load mismatching. So an energy storage device is needed. Variable nature of wind results in variable voltage and variable frequency at generator. So an AC-DC-AC link is required. In this paper, we have proposed a simulation of wind energy conversion system (WECS) using a variable speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) with battery as an energy storage device for an isolated load to prevent load mismatching.

AB This paper presents a new configuration for a wind energy conversion system (WECS) with variable speed, using a squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) for stand-alone energy system applications. The Proposed configuration utilizes converters with reduced power rating, operates with MPPT to maximum wind energy extraction, uses battery bank for energy storage and can operate with non-linear and unbalanced loads. Energy storage characteristic is desirable for wind energy conversion systems isolated from the mains since an energy interruption does not stop of the entire system. Also, the power rating of the converters is reduced compared to the generator and load power rating due to the low power requirements of the power converters to SCIG excitation control and to supply the load. It is presented also the whole proposed WECS and the system operation modes according the turbine speed. It is presented also the whole proposed system and the system operation modes according the turbine speed. The simulation of the proposed WECS is performed in conjunction with the dynamic wind turbine model of 1 kW and the results confirm the effectiveness to supply unbalanced and non-linear loads, the converters power rating reduction and operation with variable turbine speed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the system to supply unbalanced and non-linear stand alone loads.

AB To be competitive economically, various control systems are used in large scale wind turbines. These systems enable the wind turbine to work efficiently and produce the maximum power output in varying wind speed. In this paper, an adaptive control based on Radial-Basis-Function (RBF) neural network (NN) is proposed for different operation modes of variable-speed variable-pitch (VSVP) wind turbines including torque control at speeds lower than rated wind speeds, pitch control at higher wind speeds, and smooth transition between these two modes. The adaptive neural network control approximates the non-linear dynamics of the wind turbine based on input/output measurements and ensures smooth tracking of optimal tip-speed-ratio at different wind speeds. The robust NN weight updating rules are obtained using Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed control algorithm is first tested with a simplified mathematical model of a wind turbine. Second, the validity of results is verified by simulation studies on a 5 MW wind turbine simulator.

The proposed wind energy conversion system consists of a PMSG coupled to a diode-bridge rectifier, a DC-to-DC converter and a three-phase four-wire inverter. The diode-bridge rectifier is used as an AC-DC converter. The DC-DC converter is used to achieve maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for the wind turbine. The grid-side converter is controlled to supply extracted power from wind energy to the grid and to the loads as well as to compensate the harmonics, the reactive power and unbalances, so that the supply currents will be sinusoidal, balanced, and in phase with the supply voltages. A nonlinear control technique is proposed for the inverter. The effectiveness of the proposed variable speed wind energy conversion system is proved by simulation.

AB An innovative transmission mechanism, referred to as a series-type independently controllable transmission (ICT), is proposed in this study. The series-type ICT is an alternative form of the parallel-type ICT proposed in the former researches. It can provide performing functions similar to those of an infinitely variable transmission (IVT) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and produce a required and desired angular output velocity that is independently manipulated by a controller and does not depend on the angular velocity of the input shaft. While being applied to variable speed wind power systems, the ICT mechanisms could overcome turbine speed fluctuations and provide a constant speed output to the generator to generate electricity with constant frequency. The series-type ICT is composed of two planetary gear trains and two transmission-connecting members. Kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the series-type ICT are investigated and analyzed, and their analytical equations are also derived for application.

Most wind turbines are equipped with doubly fed induction generator, thereby allowing them to keep on producing while the speed varies over a wide range. This enhancement forces the monitoring methods to deal with these large variations in speed and torque, since the conditions are seldom if ever stationary. In an original and inexpensive attempt to tackle this issue through angular sampling, this paper proposes to base the surveillance of the line shafting on the instantaneous angular speed variations experienced by the high speed shaft. The unsteady behaviour of these wind turbines is also a difficulty in term of long term diagnostic, since the comparison of successive measurements is usually performed under the same operating conditions. Parametrization of the indicators according to well chosen variables might bring a valuable tool regarding several aspects. A long term experimental study carried over a 2MW wind turbine will be presented as a first application, and will be used to dress an interesting diagnosis on another wind turbine.

AB This paper presents an assessment of the variability on the output power of three different types of wind turbines commercially available. The dynamic response of terminal voltage, active power and reactive power are evaluated using time-domain simulations obtained from DIgSILENT (R) PowerFactory (TM). The assessment of the variability is performed based on probability density function, Pearson correlation coefficient and scatterplots. Results of this evaluation demonstrated that variable speed wind turbines using synchronous generator exhibits the better dynamic performance considering the wind speed changes, and highlight the need of smart grid oriented control strategies aiming at coordinated management of individual wind turbine controllers to avoid adverse implications of wind speed fluctuation.

DE Hybrid system; Battery; deep cycling and long duration life; off-grid
   telecom sites
AB The continuous increase in fuel costs for generators is driving organizations that use power in off-grid locations to search for more cost-effective ways of powering their sites. This is especially the case within the telecoms sector where grid supply is unreliable. Therefore, choosing a reliable method (including equipment) to generate electricity to run sites is vital to successfully operate equipment.
   In the case of telecoms operators this means ensuring the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) has power and functions. However, choosing the right technology to achieve this can have a major impact on the site's operating costs.
   Furthermore, the wrong choice of technology can not only be expensive to run, but also have a negative impact on a site's environmental footprint - which is not ideal when you consider the "wireless industry" is striving to play a positive role in dealing with climate change by reducing its CO2 emissions.
   One solution to this problem is for organizations to use a hybrid system that integrates a variable speed diesel DC generator (genset) with a deep cycling Li-ion battery. This can offer an extremely energy efficient alternative to using an AC generator operating 24/7. The generator simultaneously charges the battery and powers the site load. When the battery has been fully charged the generator shuts down and the battery takes over as the primary source of power. By reducing the genset runtime down to typically 4 hours per day, this approach offers major savings in fuel consumption - usually up to 74 percent savings compared with a standard genset. It also reduces CO2 emissions while increasing refuelling and service intervals.
   A complete hybrid system of this type can be packaged in a compact and light "energy container" to offer a turnkey solution that is quick and easy to install in remote locations.
   Moreover, achieving both optimum system efficiency ratings and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) reductions comes down to a careful selection of the right equipment making up the hybrid system. This includes selecting the right sub-systems comprising the best DC diesel generator, controller and battery for the task at hand. Typical factors that need to be considered include:
   The high-density cycling battery must be temperature-resistant, maintenance free, highly energy efficient, charge quickly and deliver a large number of deep discharge cycles
   The DC generator must be based on Permanent Magnetic Generation (PMG) technology so that the system can keep its weight and size to a minimum. This helps achieve an overall compact design that achieves optimum global efficiency and system reliability
   The controller must be equipped with its own dedicated software that enables the operating profile of the battery and generator to be optimized, thus delivering the lowest possible operating cost.
   The addition of PV (photovoltaic) panels or possibly wind turbines will allow further significant reductions in operating costs (OPEX) while also increasing environmental benefits.
   This paper discusses technical aspects of hybrid systems such as application needs; complete system design and optimization including DC generator, advanced battery, and controller choices. It will also review and analyse the results of various filed tests implemented to validate this concept. It concludes with a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis of a proposed hybrid system compared with existing systems based on continuously operating diesel generators.

AB Our study aims to determine how different climatic variables influence bat activity and mortality at wind farms in Portugal. The study was conducted from March to October 2007 at a wind farm with 20 turbines located in Northern Portugal. Bat activity was determined by ground bounded acoustic sampling, while mortality was assessed through fatality searches around each turbine. Sampling occurred weekly and activity was measured the night before fatality search. The highest activity and mortality rates were from Nyctalus leisleri and Pipistrellus pipistrellus. The majority of activity and mortality (95% and 94% in that order) occurred from August to October and both were significantly correlated with wind speed, temperature and relative humidity; mortality also appeared to be influenced by wind direction. Our results show that it is possible to establish a relationship between ground bounded activity and mortality. Our results are relevant for the implementation of effective minimization measures and, therefore, for bat conservation in the Mediterranean region. Specifically, our results show that nearly all (94%) of bat mortality at wind farms happens from August to October, at temperatures higher than 13.0 degrees C, and wind speeds lower than 5.0 m.s(-1).

AB The cost and mass of an offshore wind turbine power-train can be reduced by using high-temperature superconducting generators, but for a successful commercial design the superconducting generator should be as reliable as its alternatives. In this paper, we present a novel transverse flux superconducting generator topology which is suitable for low-speed, high-torque applications. The generator is designed with a stationary superconducting field winding and a variable reluctance claw pole motor for simplified mechanical structure and maximum reliability. 3D FEA simulation results of a 70 kW prototype is presented.

Aerodynamic characteristics, i.e. lift and drag coefficients and lift to drag ratio, of the wind turbine, are analyzed. Two design attack angles along with the base-line attack angle (with maximum lift to drag ratio) are selected for the wind turbine blade design exercise. Blade design outcomes are analyzed and compared along with load performance and power performance. This paper is possibly the first attempt to determine the optimized design attack angle for maximizing annual energy production, given the base-line wind turbine and the blade airfoil.

AB This paper introduces the concept of constant volt/hertz operation of offshore wind power plants (WPPs). The deployment of offshore WPPs requires power transmission from the plant to the load center inland. Because this power transmission requires submarine cables, there is a need to use high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission, which is economical for distances greater than 50 km. In the concept presented here, the onshore substation was operated at 60 Hz synced with the grid, and the offshore substation was operated at variable frequency and voltage, allowing the WPP to be operated at constant volt/hertz. In this paper, a variable frequency at rated volt/hertz operation was applied to a Type 3 doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine generator. The size of the power converter at the turbine can be significantly reduced from 30% of the rated power output in a conventional Type 3 turbine to 5% of the rated power. The DFIG allows each turbine to vary its operating speed with respect to the other turbines. Thus, small wind diversity within the WPP can be accommodated by the DFIG, and the collector system frequency can be controlled by HVDC to follow large variations in average wind speed.

AB With a growing penetration of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Wind Turbine Generations (PMSG-WT) into the modern power system, a comprehensive modeling and analysis of PMSG-WT is required to investigate its dynamic stability and interaction between large wind farm and power grids. In this work, a complete detailed MW-class variable speed Wind Turbine System based on a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator and a full-scale IGBT Voltage Source Converter is developed for PSCAD/EMTDC simulation study. This control scheme comprises both the mostly applied Maximum Point Power Tracking Operation and Double PWM active/reactive power independent control strategy. Moreover, a DC-link over-voltage protection scheme is designed and implemented in this model. A two mass drive train model is integrated into this WT model to achieve a reasonably accurate simulation on the transient stability of PMSG-WT. The feasibility of the established PMSG-WT physical model plus the effectiveness of proposed control and protection scheme are evaluated through a series of simulation studies under both variable wind speed conditions and a three-phase grid disturbance. Simulation results demonstrate that the PMSG-WT model possesses desirable capabilities of operation at the maximum power point as well as enhanced Low Voltage Ride Through Function (LVRT).

AB This paper focuses on the design, thermal loading and reliability of a three-level Neutral Point Clamped (3-L NPC) back-to-back full scale converter for a 10 MW direct-drive wind turbine equipped with a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). The reliability performance of the three-level converter is strongly influenced by the thermal behaviour of the semiconductor devices and their mission profile which directly affects the lifetime and the cost of the whole converter. Therefore, the simulation platform is developed in Matlab/Simulink and PLECS simulation environment to analyse the dynamics of the system using different kinds of modulation strategies and analyzing different wind load conditions dependent on roughness classes. It is concluded that 60 degrees discontinuous PWM modulation strategies show better thermal performance and increase the estimated lifetime of the converter. Furthermore, the increment of the wind roughness class causes a larger dispersion of the mean values and the variation of the junction temperatures, also affecting the lifetime of the converter. Hence, the cycles lifetime largely decreases considering variable wind speed profile. In fact, the results show that the reliability of the converter is strongly affected by the temperature cycle behaviour and non-linear factors of the mission profile like turbulence, 3p effect and gust.

ID TRANSMISSION; SCHEME
AB This paper suggests an operation and control strategy of an offshore wind farm based on a high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission, where the variable-speed permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbine system is adopted. The HVDC transmission system consists of a hybrid of a twelve-pulse diode rectifier and a voltage-source converter (VSC) on offshore side, whereas a VSC is employed on AC grid side (GSVSC). For this topology, the twelve-pulse diode rectifier is capable of delivering a part of wind farm power, the rest of which is absorbed naturally by the wind farm VSC (WFVSC) since the WFVSC is controlled and operated as a voltage source of a constant frequency. At grid sags, a low-voltage ride-through of HVDC transmission is achieved, in which the HVDC link voltage is controlled by the WFVSC, and the wind farm output power is reduced by increasing the generator speeds. By utilizing the uncontrolled rectifier, a cost of HVDC converter is reduced compared with a case of the fully rated VSC, while the performance is the same. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results for a 500-MW offshore wind farm have been shown to verify the validity of the proposed scheme.

AB Flicker mitigation in variable-speed wind generators can be approached by reactive power control utilizing the power-electronic converter of the machine, a technique that is bound by several factors including the network X/R ratio, line current limits and the instantaneous output of the machine. The highest flicker level is observed as the machine approaches its rated output, under such conditions in sites with favorable wind resource, sole reactive power compensation would necessitate overrated operation for long periods and increased line currents or otherwise the reactive power margin narrows possibly resulting in impaired capability in reducing flicker to compatible levels. This paper proposes coordinated power curtailment and reactive power control and assesses the feasibility of its implementation in reducing variable-speed wind generators flicker emission under high wind speed conditions. The amount of active power to be curtailed is quantified based on the observed decrease in short-term flicker P-st with respect to power factor settings.

AB Wind energy is variable and intermittent in nature. The variations in wind speed results in a stochastic output for wind turbines. Therefore, the peak generation of wind farms and peak load demand typically do not occur at the same time. This paper studies a wind farm integrated with an energy storage device at turbine level in order to shift the wind power generation to the peak demand periods. A model of system including practical utility level battery integrated with wind farm is developed and presented. In order to measure the effect of this integration, actual profiles of load, wind energy, and other power sources is studied and the Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) for wind energy, after and before adding the battery, is calculated. Results show that the battery can make significant improvements in the ELCC of wind energy.

AB Permanent magnet synchronous generator is widely used in wind turbine applications because of its high efficiency and lower maintenance. Interior permanent magnet machine has the advantage of using both reluctance torque due to saliency and common magnetic torque. In this paper a grid connected IPM generator is studied as a variable speed wind turbine. Maximum power point tracking strategy beside loss minimization of is applied to get maximum power from the wind speed. The controller part of machine side converter and grid side converter is designed and explained in details. Besides a pitch angle control is added to protect the generator from over speeding. Simulation results prove the performance of variable speed operation under and above rated wind speed.

AB Gearbox faults constitute a significant portion of all faults and downtime in wind turbines (WTs). Current-based gearbox fault diagnosis has significant advantages over traditional vibration-based techniques in terms of cost, implementation, and reliability. This paper derives a mathematical model for a WT drive train consisting of a two-stage gearbox and a permanent magnet (PM) generator, from which the characteristic frequencies of gear tooth breaks in generator stator current frequency spectra are clearly identified. A adaptive signal resampling algorithm is proposed to convert the variable fault characteristic frequencies to constant values for WTs running at variable speeds. A fault detector is proposed for diagnosis of gear tooth breaks using statistical analysis on the fault signatures extracted from the stator current spectra. Experimental results on a real gearbox are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed model and method for diagnosis of gear tooth breaks.

AB In this paper, the problem of designing an output feedback regulation control scheme of variable speed wind energy conversion system with rotor speed measurement is addressed. The controller consists of the combination of a linear control for blade pitch angle with a nonlinear H-infinity torque control and a finite-time convergent Super-Twisting Observer. This strategy does not use the wind velocity and avoid the chattering phenomena. The nonlinear H-infinity torque control take into account the nonlinear dynamic aspect of the wind turbine and the turbulent nature of the wind, also mitigate the effects of external disturbances that occur at the input and output of the system. The controller exhibits better power and speed regulation when compared to classic linear controllers. In order to validate the mathematical model and evaluate the performance of proposed controller, we used the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) aerolastic wind turbine simulator FAST. Simulation and validation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of power and speed regulation. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the model, a fuzzy control of wind turbine is developed Wind turbine control loop provides the reference inputs for the electric generator control loop in order to make the system run with maximum power. Since the wind speed involved in the aerodynamic equations is a stochastic variable, whose effective value cannot be measured directly, a wind speed estimator is also proposed.

AB Variable speed doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) are preferred in wind generation systems because they offer several advantages in terms of control and aerodynamic efficiency. While it is generally a stable machine, its converter systems may not work properly under severe grid fault conditions. This article presents a strategy of riding through the low voltage conditions through control of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system. The reactive power supplied by the SMES helps the voltage recovery, while the real power improves the damping properties of the post disturbance system. Simulation studies show that the proposed SMES control strategy restores normal operation of the wind system in reasonably short period of time.

AB The crowbar circuit installed in the rotor side is frequently adopted by doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) to implement low voltage ride through (LVRT) ability. Based on DFIG transient characteristic, this paper discusses the principle of choosing crowbar resistance and input lasting time from the view point of converter security, wind turbine security and wind power generation system restoring stability. A simulation model of DFIG was built. The numeric tests studied the impact of different crowbar resistances on LVRT ability of DFIG with grid voltage dip, and crowbar circuit input lasting time impact on LVRT ability with consideration of reactive power compensation ability during grid fault. The results showed that reasonable crowbar resistance and input lasting time can improve LVRT ability of DFIG and is helpful for wind power generation system to restore stability smoothly.

This paper adopts the equivalent circuit of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to derive the equation of the reactive power balance. Based on the equivalent circuit, the paper discussed the relationship of the reduced reactive power (R.P) between the stator and rotor circuit with different frequency. All of those reveal that the DFIG has an enormous mechanism to adjust the reactive power flexibly. After studying the stator and rotor R.P.C of the DFIG, we summarized the influence of the rotor R. P from the slid ratio and the stator R.P. And the end, we verify the correction of theory by a simulation.

It is specifically targeted to large wind installations, specifically offshore wind applications. This control strategy maximizes the life of the battery and increases the efficiency of the energy storage system while still balancing the power fluctuations of a large wind turbine system. The depth of discharge and remaining battery life are the key parameters considered in this approach. The proposed control scheme is applied to the battery package such that each battery cell is controlled individually. Individual cell depth of discharge is controlled and cell life is calculated periodically so that all cells within the package reach the end of life at the same. Total storage capacity and individual battery cell size are calculated based on the characteristics of the wind turbine. To verify the presented method, a case is studied in PSCAD and corresponding results are provided.

AB A Department of Energy study showed wind power generation may reach 330 GW and 20% penetration of total generated at offshore wind power plants. The deployment of offshore wind power plants requires power transmission from the plant to the load center inland. Depending on the distance to shore, the use of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission may be economically justified. The use of HVDC ha many operational and reliability advantages, and among them is the possibility of variable frequency operation of the sending-end (offshore wind power plant) power converter. The will allow the offshore wind power plant to operate at variable frequency but constant volt/hertz ratio.
   In this paper, a variable frequency constant volt/hertz operation will be applied to the Type 1 wind turbing (induction generator) for offshore wind power plants. The benefits of such variable frequency constant volt/hertz application include (a) low-cost variable speed wind turbines (no need to install a power converter at each turbine), (b) improved energy capture of the wind turbine by variable speed operation, and (c) enhanced compliance in energy conversion from aerodynamic to mechanical to electrical power. Various control aspects of Type 1 generators at the plant level and at the turbine level will be investigated. The potential impact of the proposed system on lowering the cost wind power will be investigated as well.

AB Due to the differing electromechanical characteristics of modern variable speed wind turbines to conventional generators, the provision of ancillary services from wind generation is likely to change the nature of the frequency response of power systems to contingency events. This paper explores the aggregate contribution from wind turbines to the frequency response of future power systems, considering both emulated inertial and governor controls. In particular, the potential issues that may arise as a result of the changing nature of the system frequency response due to the uncertainty over the distribution of ancillary services from embedded generation on the network, are examined in the context of future power system requirements.

AB This paper addresses the problem of controlling wind energy conversion systems (WECS) which involve permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) fed by IGBT-based buck-to-buck rectifier-inverter. The goal of control is to maximize wind energy extraction and this needs letting the wind turbine rotor operate in variable-speed mode. Interestingly, the present study features the achievement of the above energetic goal without resorting to sensors for wind velocity. The control strategy involves: (i) a non-linear regulator designed by the backstepping technique; (ii) a sensorless online reference-speed optimizer designed using the turbine power characteristic to achieve the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) requirement. It is formally shown that the proposed controller actually meets its control objectives. This theoretical result is confirmed by several simulations.

AB The purpose of the authors' research is to develop a variable ratio gearbox (VRG) that enables discrete variable speed operation for fixed-speed wind turbines in the production range of 50 to 500 kW. Previous work suggests that this device can increase power production by 7% over the original configuration. The current study further increases the wind capture by applying control to the VRG and mechanical brake. In this technique the selected gear ratio produces torque slightly above the level that is required, by the generator, for full power. This excess torque is removed through the mechanical brake, and full load production is realized simultaneously. This paper discusses the framework and decision-making protocol used to control these two subsystems. The control design process uses dynamic programming to insure maximum energy production while conserving brake liner. System performance is simulated for twenty sets of wind data that cover a wide range of wind conditions. The results demonstrate that full production can be achieved across greater ranges of wind speed, and can increase electrical production by an average of 10% for the sites considered.

AB Based on the complete model of the Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS), a robust nonlinear control using high order sliding modes (SM) is proposed to capture maximum wind power and to regulate the reactive stator power. First a slave current control is designed, then three schemes are considered to deal with captured power problem, a) Control of electromagnetic torque, b) Control of generator speed considering turbine dynamics and c) Control of generator speed considering turbine dynamics as unmodeled. Simulation results are shown to validate designed control laws.

ID LOAD REDUCTION
AB The standard wind turbine (WT) control law modifies the torque applied to the generator as a quadratic function of the generator speed (K omega(2)) while blades are positioned at some optimal pitch angle (beta*). The value of K and beta* should be properly selected such that energy capture is increased. In practice, the complex and time-varying aerodynamics a WT face due to turbulent winds make their determination a hard task. The selected constant parameters may maximize energy for a particular, but not all, wind regime conditions. Adaptivity can modify the controller to increase power capture under variable wind conditions.
   This paper present new analysis tools and an adaptive control law to increase the energy captured by a wind turbine. Due to its simplicity, it can be easily added to existing industry-standard controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is assessed by simulations on a high-fidelity aeroelastic code.

AB To tackle maximum wind power tracking problems, a fuzzy sliding mode control strategy was developed in this paper. This method established sliding mode surface based on state variable of generator rotational speed and electromagnetic torque, and equivalent control law and switch control law were obtained. Meanwhile, fuzzy rule inference method was proposed based on state of sliding surface to flexible on-off component in order to weaken sliding mode control chattering, and then fuzzy sliding mode control law was gained. Furthermore, optimal operating region of wind turbine was introduced and maximum wind power capture control of a 1.5MW wind power generator unit was studied. The simulation results show that the improved fuzzy sliding mode control can adjust wind turbine rotational speed to follow wind speed accurately, and make wind turbine output power in optimal operating region, with maintaining optimal tip-speed ratio and maximum power coefficient, and reduce mechanical load of the unit under the capture of maximum wind energy.

The ICCEA is based on general co-evolution model, and can choose evolutionary algorithm for its subpopulations independently, and regulate the probabilities of individuals production to promote the speed of evolutionary according to the characteristic of control system by introducing chi(2) distribution function. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can efficiently and steady control the output power of the wind power generation system. Compared with the traditional PID controller, the controller has better control performance.

ID FIXED-SPEED
AB Doubly fed induction generator use a back-to-back dual PWM converters that it can decouple of active power and reactive power, leading to reduce the system's frequency response. If it does not take additional control strategy, when the wind turbine capacity increases to a certain extent, frequency stability of the grid will have a significant hazard. On the one hand, when the frequency control loop responding the diversification of the system frequency is installed in the rotor of the doubly-fed variable speed wind turbines, the frequency can be regulated by controlling the rotor's kinetic energy. On the other hand, by additional frequency control loop is installed in pitch angle control system, the wind turbine can also contribute to frequency control. In this paper by synthesizing the above two methods, wind farms can be participate in a better performance in frequency regulation. The results of the simulation show that the above-mentioned method is correct.

AB Owing to the characteristics of the variable wind speed and small gear samples, the gear reliability of a wind turbine gearbox is hard to predict. In order to solve this problem, a complete reliability prediction model is presented in this article. Firstly, distribution parameters of the gear stress are deduced according to the variable wind data, and a linear path is defined for the time-varying stress. Next, historical gear samples are transformed into the equivalent prior data by grey relational analysis and then the posterior data is deduced by Bayes data fusion. Then, distribution parameters and a non-linear path are determined for the time-varying gear strength. After that, the dynamic reliability of gears in a wind turbine gearbox is calculated on the basis of the stress-strength interference model and the Monte Carlo sampling. Lastly, an instance is given to verify the validity of this model. The result shows that the variable wind speed will decline the reliability of wind gears, in addition, the reliability declines faster than its expectation in the infant mortality period.

AB In this paper, nonlinear control of permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) for wind energy conversion system (WECS) is investigated in order to maximize the generated power from wind turbine. The control strategy combines the technique of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method and sliding mode (SM) nonlinear control. A speed and pitch control scheme for variable speed wind turbines are proposed. The block diagram of the WECS with PMSG and a back-to-back PWM converter structure is established with the dq frame of axes. Both converters used the sliding mode control scheme considering the variation of wind speed. A speed controller is designed to maximize the extracted energy from the wind, below the rated power area, while the objectives of grid-side converter are to deliver the energy from the PMSG side to the utility grid, to regulate the DC-link voltage and to achieve unity power factor and low distortion currents. The employed control strategy can regulate both the reactive and active power independently by quadrature and direct current components, respectively. With fluctuating wind, the controller is capable to maximize wind-energy capturing. Under varying load condition and at constant load, the controller can maintain the load voltage and frequency quite well. The system is built using Matlab/Simulink environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

The study of a wind farm with permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) is presented. The 10 MW wind farm consists of 5 PMSGs based 2MW generators connected to a common DC-bus. Each PMSG of the wind farm is connected to the DC-bus through a rectifier, but the DC-bus is connected to the grid through only one DC/AC inverter. The proposed control strategy combines pulse width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control method. The PMSG side converters are used to achieve MPPT. The grid-side converter regulates dc-link voltage and injects the generated power into the AC network. Direct power control of three phases PWM inverter is adopted. Grid-side reactive and active power decoupling method is applied in order to track maximum wind power and regulate the grid-side power factor. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy has excellent performance.

AB Based on the analyses of the dynamic characteristics and operation data of variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) doubly-fed wind power generation system that is consisted of wind turbine, variable speed gear box and doubly-fed induction generator, this paper built an new logic math model of VSCF doubly-fed wind power generation system by use the tools of Pan-Boolean algebra theory. The model input variables are wind speed, generator stator power, and generator rotational speed. The model output variables are paddle angle, generator rotator power. A sets of Pan-Boolean algebra equations are used to describing the system control characteristics. The simulation results are shown that this model method is correct. It is significance for the wind power generation system control.

AB This paper has two main objectives: to explain the dynamic characterization of wind farms as part of their integration in power systems using modal analysis and to present a qualitative development for understanding the main factors that impact on the damping of the oscillation modes by incorporating wind farms based on variable speed wind turbines. Moreover, such developments are validated by performing simulations on a 2017 peak scenario for the Uruguayan electrical system, showing a strong interaction between the hydroelectrics power plants located on the Rio Negro and future wind farms Palmatir and Agua Leguas.

AB This work aims the description, modeling and simulation of the incorporation of a power system stabilizer (PSS) in variable speed wind turbines in order to dampen oscillation in power grids. The proposed PSS aims to alter the nature of the electric power injected by the wind farms to, in some sense, mimic the oscillatory behavior of synchronous generators and allows dampening these transient oscillations. The main advantage of this stabilizing action lies in the fact that the wind turbines, by decoupling the electrical frequency of the network respect its rotational speed by the inclusion of power electronic converters, allows the injection of oscillating power without risk of suffering stability issues. This allows to improve the oscillation damping between different synchronous generators. The proposed PSS has been analyzed in a grid of three areas: an area comprises the infinite bus; the second one a synchronous generator and the third one contains a synchronous generator and a wind farm. The PSS takes as reference the active power injected by the synchronous generator of the third area using synchrophasors. Finally, it is studied the performance of the PSS for a particular case of the Uruguayan power grid. In this scenario, the second area is composed by the hydro power plant Baygorria; the third area is comprised by the hydro power plant Terra and the wind farms Palmatir and Agua Leguas; finally, the first area is the rest of the power system.

AB In this work, wind turbine pitch angle control using a Fuzzy controller is presented. This controller is implemented in Fuzzy Logic Toolbox (TM) available in MATLAB (R). The controller was built based on knowledge on operation principles of wind turbines equipped with variable pitch angle control. Not requiring mathematical models for this. It is presented as an alternative for Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers currently used. Furthermore, the control aims to reduce the fluctuations in turbine power generation. The control was integrated with the Dynamic Simulation Program developed by INESC, which uses PI controllers. Simulations are performed varying the incident wind speed on a wind farm equipped with squirrel cage asynchronous generators. These simulations prove the efficiency of the pitch control using Fuzzy Logic.
