AB In high altitude wind power (HAWP) generating system, medium voltage AC (MV-AC) permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is used. The generated electrical power is transmitted to ground without any power conditioning in the air-borne unit. The ground based power conversion system (PCS) interfaces variable voltage and variable frequency medium voltage power into distribution level grid voltage. The proposed PCS consists of a three-level vienna rectifier for generation side control, a half bridge DC-DC converter for isolation and step-down purpose and a grid/load connected inverter for load side active power control. Three-level operation in the generation side converter reduces the switch/diode voltage stress to half and therefore allows to use low voltage rating power semiconductor devices. The vienna rectifier is controlled for sensorless maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) of the air-borne wind turbine. The phase lock loop (PLL) is used for speed and rotor position detection of the PMSG for optimal torque control of the airborne wind turbine (AWT). Simulation studies have been carried out using computer programs like PSIM and MATLAB. For the validation of the proposed methodology, scaled down laboratory based prototype is built and tested. The obtained experimental results confirm the performance of the PCS for interfacing HAWP generation system to the grid.

AB In this paper, a new modeling method of the variable speed variable pitch wind turbine is proposed. More specifically, the linear parameter varying model of wind turbines is optimized by utilizing the variable forgetting factor recursive least squares identification algorithm, which improves the accuracy of the online estimation of the aerodynamic parameters. As the power factor results in the nonlinear characteristics of the wind turbine, the nonlinear power factor is approximate to a polynomial function of the tip speed ratio and the pitch angle. Then the relationship between the aerodynamic parameters and the power factor can be deduced. Furthermore, the solving problem of aerodynamic parameters can be transformed into the identification of the power factor. It is depicted in the simulation results that the modeling method of wind turbines can be optimized from the proposed variable forgetting factor recursive least squares identification algorithm, and the controller obtained from the optimized model can improve stability.

AB In this paper, a novel extended state observer (ESO) based integral sliding model control (ISMC) approach is proposed to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) variable speed wind energy conversion systems (VS-WECS). The proposed control approach adopts optimum tip speed ratio tracking scheme to realize maximum wind energy capture. Considering strong nonlinear and uncertainty features of VS-WECS, the ISMC is developed on the basis of the rotor angular speed tracking model. The sliding mode surface function consists of the integral term of the rotor angular speed tracking error, which ensures the rotor angular speed tracking without error at stable state. To eliminate the undesired chattering phenomena aroused from the sign function in the sliding mode control law, an ESO is designed to estimate the wind turbine aerodynamic torque. Using torque estimate feedback technique, the gain of sign function has the capability of self-adjustment according to the fluctuation of wind speed. Simulation results show that the proposed control approach has better tracking performance compared with that of conventional PI regulator.

The overall system is decomposed into four subsystems, where each control area has an independent MPC controller. These subsystem-based MPC controllers work cooperatively while satisfying systemwide optimal problems. Simulation results show that with the proposed distributed MPC technique, the overall system has good performance in face of load disturbance, while respecting generation rate constraints (GRC).

ID CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS
AB This paper investigate an asymmetric support vector machine approach for wind turbine hydraulic pitch systems. Hydraulic pitching system in the wind turbine is critical for energy capture, load reduction and aerodynamic braking. Its reliability and maintenance is thus of high priority. The fault of cylinder internal leakage is studied in this paper.
   The fault and not-fault conditions for the internal leakage in the hydraulic system are classified through the self-learning asymmetric support vector machine (ASVM) algorithm, which can maintain the complexity of the fault model. The improved ASVM algorithm can adaptively select the minimal number of support vectors while maintaining the desired classification performance, which makes the practical implementation of the classifier computationally more efficient. The proposed method is verified through the simulation study based on the aerodynamic loading on the pitching axis under smooth and turbulent wind profiles obtained from the simulation of a 1.5 MW variable-speed turbine model on the FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structural and Tower) software developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

Firstly, the nonlinear wind turbine model was built and the nonaffine wind energy conversion system was converted into an affine system through a novel system transformation. The transformed system becomes linear with respect to the new input while the traditional backstepping approach was not needed, by this means the synthesis to be extremely simplified. Then the adaptive neural universal tracking control algorithm was adopted to local controller for system model. Finally, a numerical simulation was given to illustrate the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB Based on the analysis of the wind turbine model characteristics, the essence of the maximum wind energy tracking problem of variable speed wind turbines is transformed into controlling the rotor speed to track the optimal rotor speed. The generator torque is used as a control input to force the wind turbine to stay close to the maximum energy point in the below-rated power region. In this paper, a nonlinear tracking controller of variable speed wind turbines with a fuzzy logic adjustable parameter is proposed, which does not need wind speed measurement and avoids the complex linearization. The controller makes the wind turbines output more power and the mechanical loads acceptable, which is verified in the simulation using the FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) code.

AB This paper proposes a novel maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategy for variable speed wind turbine system using the optimal torque sliding mode control technique. In this strategy, the generator optimal torque tracking error and its integral are selected as system state variables, and a dynamic sliding mode controller is designed to improve the wind energy capture efficiency and shorten MPPT response time for variable wind speed working condition. The actual control input signal is formed from a first-order integral operation of the original sliding mode control input signal, which makes the generator actual control input reference current signal continuous and smoothing. It also contributes greatly to chattering attenuation and avoiding large fluctuations of the generator output power. The simulation results for a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind turbine system have proved the validity of the proposed control strategy.

AB This paper proposes control of a grid connected variable speed wind energy conversion using factional calculus. The global system contains a wind turbine emulator and PMSG connected to the grid via two back-to-back converters. The control system under study is composed of two parts, a current vector control with fractional order PI controller (FOPI) on the speed loop to ensure maximum power extraction and a direct power control (DPC) to guarantee a unity power factor. The fractional order PI controllers are designed using the isodamping feature, which desensitizes the phase frequency variations, by means a flat phase around a gain crossover frequency. This increases the robustness of a fractional order control system against uncertainties. The proposed control scheme improves the tracking performance and system robustness. To investigate the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed controller, an experimental bench is built. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed controller over integer order controllers by realizing maximum power extraction and improving the grid-side power factor for a wide range of wind speeds.

AB This paper presents the application of H-infinity controller for speed control of variable speed wind turbine system. For constant Wind speed and blade pitch angle aerodynamic torque coming from wind is constant, with the increase in demanded electrical torque the rotor speed decrease. Preferred function of the wind turbine is to keep the turbine speed close to rated speed and also the output power close to the rated. In this control method by controlling the demanded electrical torque the rotor speed is maintained constant. With the help of simulation it has been shown that at different demanded electrical torque the rotor speed is constant hence uncertainty due to demanded electrical torque is restrained by the robust controller.

For unique features of PMSG like high power density, less maintenance requirement in comparison to the other kind of machine, it is pioneering in the WECS technology. In this paper modeling of PMSG and PWM converter have been explored well. The control of PMSG in its machine side and grid side has been achieved by Field Oriented Control(Vector Control). The machine side converter is controlled by a vector control strategy. The grid side converter is controlled by proposing a grid side voltage oriented control by which the DC link voltage is achieved constant. Finally the simulation of the model is performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK and all the results has been discussed briefly.

AB The paper focuses on possibility of integrating different renewable energy sources (RES) and how the integrated system could be effectively utilized to supply power to remote and far-flung areas where grid connection is challenging and power demand is nominal. A detailed modeling of solar photovoltaic (SPV) system, a wind energy system (WES) and a micro hydro system (MHS) and their integration and eventual connection to a common AC bus feeding power to three-phase load is presented. Along with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) system, the SPV system has a DC-DC converter to obtain a regulated DC output. The voltage source inverter (VSI) performs DC-AC conversion, the AC output being smoothen by means of an LC filter. The WES consists of fixed pitch angle and a variable speed wind turbine model which acts as prime mover to a capacitor excited asynchronous generator (CAG) meant for generating the rated voltage. Similarly the MHS is modeled with a CAG assuming a constant input power. The integrated system is modeled in Matlab simulink environment and the simulated results are presented for different three-phase loads. The inferences are drawn and adequately explained.

AB The common practice regarding the modelling of large generation components has been to make use of models representing the performance of the individual components with a required level of accuracy and details. Owing to the rapid increase of wind power plants comprising large number of wind turbines, parameters and models to represent each individual wind turbine in detail makes it necessary to develop aggregated wind power plant models considering the simulation time for power system stability studies. In this paper, aggregated wind power plant models consisting of the IEC 61400-27 variable speed wind turbine models (type 3 and type 4) with a power plant controller is presented. The performance of the detailed benchmark wind power plant model and the aggregated model are compared by means of simulations for the specified test cases. Consequently, the results are summarized and discussed in terms of model accuracy, simulation time and modeling assumptions.

The short-circuit current behavior of conventional generators (for instance those used in heat and power plants), of generators equipped with full convertors and of double fed induction generators (DFIG) are described from the perspective of a distribution system operator (DSO) with limited information about the power plants. Special attention is given to variable speed generators; i.e. equipped with power electronic devices. Default figures are given for the assessment of the short-circuit current contribution by dispersed generators to a fault in a MV grid.

AB Training power system operators for situations with a high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) is a prospective task of most system operator entities. The objective of this paper is to develop simplified but accurate models of variable speed wind turbine generation (WTG) which are implementable into a real-time training simulator (RTS) environment for a realistic operational training. The behaviour of the generation unit model to grid side voltage incidents depends on the voltage control strategy (VCS) and priority conditions which are selected by the power plant operator. The unit capability diagram is considered as a feature on how much reactive power could be supplied by the unit. The models are suitable for root-mean square (RMS) and balanced simulations and can be adjusted to resemble any vendor products.

The dynamic model considers a stochastic model of the wind, a state-space representation of the wind turbine with the PMSG, avoiding the use of a gear box, and a back-to-back converter for the interconnection of system with the grid. A field oriented control technique in the dq reference frame was used for the converter, also a control loop for the pitch angle of the wind turbine was implemented. In order to show the performance of the controllers, they were implemented in an Arduino card and then connected to a specialized station in real time simulations. Case studies that show the dynamic behavior of the wind turbine are presented and discussed.

AB This paper presents a design of surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous generator with concentrated windings. The machine is designed for a variable speed direct driven vertical axis wind turbine. One of the optimized parameters in the design procedure is the cost of active material. High efficiency, high torque density and easy scalability are some attributes that makes the surface mounted PM machines very attractive solutions for wind power application. However, the cost of the active material, especially permanent magnets, has to be minimized. The results presented here shows low harmonic contents of the air gap flux density and the induced voltage. Hence, the cogging torque is very low, which together with low radial forces indicates a low magnetic noise as well.

AB Brushless doubly-fed induction machines (BDFIM) have great potential as variable-speed generators in larger-scale wind turbines. Undesired space harmonics exist because the special rotor needs to couple both two stator windings which with different pole-pair numbers and different frequencies. These rich space harmonics lead to a bigger torque ripple comparing to the normal induction machine. This paper makes use of 2D multi-slice finite element (FE) method to study the effect of the rotor skew on the performance of the BDFIM in the cases without and with saturation. The results show the torque ripple is reduced significantly by skewing the rotor both in those two situations. But the rotor skew has negligible influence on the harmonics due to the saturation effect. Furthermore, the rotor skew has little influence on the total amount of losses. However, based on the simulation results, it redistributes the core losses along the axial direction in the BDFIM.

To reduce weight further, a tooth-wound coil winding is chosen for the generator.

AB As wind turbines increase their power rating, their size and mass increase as well. Therefore, the higher reliability is needed in order to minimize maintenance. Direct-drive PM (DDPM) generators are a good solution to this problem because they omit the gearbox. The large generator mass has been also a difficult problem limiting the practical use of DDPM generators, which makes them difficult to build, transport and install. In this paper, a rotor supporting a 7MW DDPM generators is optimized by a response surface model (RSM). The dimensions that greatly influence the stiffness are taken as optimized design variables. Minimizing the mass is taken as the optimized objective, and the stiffness demands are taken as constraint conditions. The simulations show that the required level of stiffness can be met while reducing the mass by 11000 kg (34%) and the optimization results show the validity of the optimization method for the lightweight design of structures.

AB This paper presents a control and simulation of hybrid renewable energy system connected to the grid. The studied system includes a photovoltaic panel, synchronous permanent magnet generator based wind turbine, and a battery for storage energy. The PV array and wind systems are connected to the common DC bus by a boost converter. The battery is connected by a bi-directional DC/DC converter, and then integrated into the AC utility grid via a common DC/AC inverter. In order to extract the maximum energy, a simulation study has been carried out according to the meteorological conditions (wind speed and variable solar irradiance) while maintaining power quality at a satisfactory level. In order to capture the maximum power, a MPPT algorithm is applied for both wind turbine and photovoltaic panel. The modeling and simulation of the whole system has been performed under Matlab/Simulink environment. The obtained results show that the current and the voltage of grid side are sinusoidal and alternative forms, and the power injected to the grid is around the power produced by the hybrid system.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Voltage stability is an important issue to be considered in power system with large scale wind power integration. The mechanism of transient voltage instability induced by wind power is studied. A variable speed wind turbine can control the power rapidly and flexibly with power electronic convertors. The fast dynamics related to power electronic control transients can be neglected, and the wind power is simplified to static power injection model in electromechanical transients. The wind power is modelled with power balance algebraic equations, and the system dynamic equations arc differential algebraic equations. The trajectory encountering a singular point corresponds to transient voltage instability of the system, and at this point the power balance equations of wind power become insoluble. Simulation results validate the mechanism, and reveal the variation of instability mode of a wind-thermal-bundled sending system. As the proportion of wind power increases, the instability mode of the system changes from rotor angle instability dominated by synchronous generator to voltage instability dominated by wind power.

AB A blade pitch angle control in Wind Turbine (WT) is important to achieve a constant output torque for attaining stability of WT. Therefore, accurate and effective controlling techniques are proposed and designed to produce constant output torque. In this context, two controlling techniques, i.e. Proportional-Integral (PI) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) based blade pitch angle control is implemented and their performance is analysed. Both the controlling techniques are investigated in terms of torque stability and response time. The proposed system is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The performance of the system with these control techniques is investigated under variable wind speed conditions such as small and large duration variations, increase and decrease of wind speed. However, the performance of both the systems is found satisfactory, but system with FLC shows better performance as compare to PI based system in terms of settling time.

AB In order to investigate small wind turbines, a comprehensive knowledge of mechanical and electrical parameters is required. Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) is one of the kinds which are widely used for variable speed and direct driven wind power generating. In order to predict the amount of power that can be extracted by the wind turbine in a concerned area the knowledge of wind speed pattern for that particular location is required. In this paper a case study is selected to study the wind pattern and investigate the performance of the PMSG based wind power generation system for fixed speed and variable speed conditions. Wind power generation system simulated using MATLAB / Simulink consisting of wind turbine, PMSG, diode rectifier, Maximum Power Point tracking (MPPT) controlled boost converter, and DC load is considered. The Hill Climbing Search (HCS) algorithm is implemented using Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for MPPT. The effectiveness of PMSG based wind power generation in the case study is investigated with the environmental conditions recorded at BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad campus, Telangana, India.

AB the applications of wind energy develops much more rapidly than the other renewable resources such as solar, geothermal etc. in the 21st century. It becomes the third core energy resource following non conventional fuels as oil and chemical. Electrical energy generated by wind power plants is the fastest developing and most promising renewable energy source. The wind is a clean, free and inexhaustible energy source. The origin of wind is simple.
   Wind turbines are classified into two types as fixed speed and variable speed wind turbine. A variable speed wind turbine provides more energy than the fixed speed wind turbines, reduce power fluctuations and improve reactive power supply. Basically direct drive PMSG (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator) and DFIG (Double Fed Induction Generator) are used in variable speed wind turbine generator. In this paper, the Matlab simulations of a Wind Energy Conversion System with PMSG and variable-speed wind turbine have been discussed.

AB According to the energy yield of wind turbines, a new design method for optimizing wind turbine blades based on the aerodynamics is presented. The design object is the minimum cost of energy which is calculated from the Annual Energy Production (AEP) and the cost of the rotor. The design variables used in the current study are the chord and twist angle. The blade shape parameters and the loads of the blades are considered as the constraints. With the model in this paper, one 2 MW wind turbine rotor is designed. The aerodynamic characteristics of the designed rotor are simulated and plotted. To prove the reliability of the results, the comparison between the designed 2 MW rotor and one existing widely used 2 MW rotor is completed. The rated wind speed is reduced from the 15m/s to 12.8 m/s that displays the designed rotor has high power at the low wind speed. The maximum power coefficient is increased from 0.463 to 0.49 that can effectively improve the annual power generation.

AB Renewable energy systems become more present in the energy market and wind power has already proven it's potential. The offshore wind farms have also been continuing its growth rapidly due to much better wind conditions like onshore wind farms.
   The studied system here is a variable speed wind generation system based on Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). In this topology, stator side converter and rotor side converter is used to implement the DFIG control to achieve wind power conversion. Here, a maximum power control strategy is incorporated with the DFIG, whereby the produced power serves as the active power reference for the DFIG. Stator flux oriented vector control is applied to decouple the control of active and reactive power generated by the DFIG based wind turbine.
   A DC/DC boost converter is used for DFIG system to DC grid connection. This system represents transferring offshore wind power to the terrestrial ac grid through the High Voltage DC (HVDC) network. The details of the control strategy and system simulation results in Simulink are presented in the paper.

AB In smart electrical grids, wind turbines with variable speed are the most attractive choice for high penetration level of wind energy due to their high operation flexibility. Wind turbines are the core component of the wind energy conversion. In this paper, the objectives are to build a realistic wind turbine model for smart grid analysis and simulations, and propose wind power adaptive control algorithms with a mixed criterion of energy maximization and fatigue load minimization during partial and full load regimes. The modelling approach considers wind aerodynamics and tower dynamics. The generator torque set points are calculated based on the wind turbine design values and rotor speed. The blade pitch angle set point is calculated using a proportional feedback control loop during partial load conditions, and a proportional differential control loop during full load conditions. The wind speed is also modelled considering wind turbulence, tower shadow and wind shear. Models and controllers are built in MATLAB Simulink, and simulations are performed using a realistic data of a typical wind turbine. The simulation results show that the proposed models and controllers accurately simulate the expected performance.

The proposed method employs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for estimation of all electrical parameters of the DFIG, i.e., the stator and rotor resistances, the leakage inductances of stator and rotor, and the mutual inductance. The nonlinear state space model of the DFIG is derived and the design procedure of the EKF is described. The observability matrix of the linearized DFIG model is computed and the observability is checked online for different operation conditions. The estimation performance of the EKF is illustrated by simulation results. The estimated parameters are plotted against their actual values. The estimation performance of the EKF is also tested under variations of the DFIG parameters to investigate the estimation accuracy for changing parameters.

The proposed scheme uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for estimation of rotor speed and rotor position. Moreover, the EKF is used to estimate the mechanical torque of the generator to allow for maximum power point tracking control for wind speeds below the nominal wind speed. For EKF design, the nonlinear state space model of the DFIG is derived. The estimation and control performance of the proposed sensorless control method are illustrated by simulation results at low, high, and close to the synchronous speed. The designed EKF is robust to machine parameter variations within reasonable limits. Finally, the performances of the EKF and a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) observer are compared for time-varying wind speeds.

The research considered the wake effect of wind turbines and was run for 3 cases: constant wind speed and constant wind direction, constant wind speed and variable wind direction, variable wind speed and variable wind direction. It focused on finding the best position of each turbine in wind farm to minimize the impact of a turbine on others in term of harnessing the power. The simulation shows that the best position was achieved when 73 turbines are installed in Wind Farm with total power 37,611 kW (518.4 kW each) and 2 kilometers square length of area when wind speed 12 m/s and wind direction constant.

AB This paper investigates the optimized model and the behavior of a variable speed wind energy conversion system (WECS) based on permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). Models and equations that describe different components of the WECS are addressed and their implementations into PSCAD/EMTDC are described. There are different types of synchronous generators, but the PMSG is chosen because the elimination of gearbox and introduction of variable speed control would even further increase the availability of the system. The proposed model has a set of IGBT converter-inverter connected through a DC bus associated with the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) system. Three models for the converter-inverter set have been used and their performances have been compared. Simulation results show that the controllers can extract maximum power and regulate the voltage and frequency under varying wind conditions. The controllers show very good dynamic and transient performances.

AB During last decade, the concept of a variable speed wind turbine equipped with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) has received increasing attention due to its noticeable advantages over other wind turbine generator concepts. New configuration of DFIG is single external feeding of DFIG (SEF-DFIG) where a rotor side converter (RSC) replaces the back to back variable frequency converter (VFC) in the conventional DFIG. The main issue of wind turbines that equipped DFIG and SEF-DFIG is the grid faults or low voltage ride through capability. In this paper, a new solution for uninterrupted operation of wind turbine driving a SEF-DFIG has been proposed during fault condition in the grid. A fault current limiter (FCL) is placed in series with the rotor circuit. During fault condition FCL enters a impedance in the rotor circuit to inhabit increasing of current in the rotor circuit. When the fault is cleared the FCL bypasses the impedance. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) has been applied for supplying required reactive power in faults and steady states. Capability and modeling accuracy of the proposed method confirmed with simulating a sample power system in PSCAD/EMTDC software.

AB Recently, the idea of a variable speed wind turbine equipped with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) has obtained great regard because of its considerable superiority over other wind turbine generators. New configuration of DFIG is single external feeding of DFIG (SEF-DFIG) where a rotor side converter (RSC) is set instead of the back to back variable frequency converter (VFC) in the conventional DFIG. In this paper, the vector control method for the SEF-DFIG is defined, then DFIG and SEF-DFIG operation in wind turbine system (WTS) during normal condition and grid fault, is compared. Also a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is employed to supply the reactive power and voltage support to a wind turbine equipped with conventional DFIG and SEF-DFIG and power system during normal grid condition and grid faults. Simulation has been done using PSCAD/EMTDC software.

AB Self-excited induction generators are extensively used for wind power generation in remote and grid-isolated areas. It is challenging to maintain constant voltage and frequency under variable loads conditions for such kind of generators. As a result, its applications have been limited in the field. One of the technique used to regulate voltage is shunt compensation scheme i.e. by connecting STATCOM in shunt with the load which improve voltage profile. This paper presents the dynamic analysis of three-phase self-excited induction generator (SEIG) with and without shunt compensation statcom feeding a static load. Mathematical modeling and simulation study is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink. The rotor reference frame is recommended for the analysis. Here the statcom provides the additional reactive power desired to regulate the generator output voltage under variable loads. Mathematical modeling and suitable simulations responses justify the analysis.

AB Wind speed correlation, time variation of wind turbine generator's forced outage rate (WTG FOR), and dependent failure of WTGs in adverse weather are three factors that affect reliability evaluation of wind integrated power systems. These three factors are related to weather conditions, which can be divided into normal and adverse weather conditions. Although wind speed correlation has been well studied by researchers, the other two factors are not addressed in the existing reliability models of wind farms. A new enhanced reliability model of wind farms is proposed in this paper to effectively incorporate all of these factors. In the proposed model, WTGs are assumed to fail dependently in adverse weather, but independently in normal weather and the dependency of WTG FOR value on weather conditions is considered. Nataf transformation method (NTM) is chosen to simulate correlated random variables for correlated weather conditions, correlated wind speeds, and WTG dependent outages. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of studies have been carried out on the IEEE RTS with two wind farms added. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed wind farm model.

ID SYSTEMS; ENERGY
AB The increasing penetration of large-scale wind generation in power systems will challenge the power system inertia due to the reason that the converter based variable speed wind turbines have no contribution to the system inertia. Traditionally, a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind power plant naturally does not provide frequency response because of the decoupling between the output power and the frequency. Moreover, DFIGs also lack power reserve margin because of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation. In this paper, a virtual inertial control strategy of the DFIG based wind turbines called supplementary control loop for inertial response is investigated. When the system frequency is changing severely, the output power of DFIG should respond to it rapidly through the virtual inertial controller at the same time. The rotor speeds of wind turbines can also be adjusted into this procedure. The inertial control methods proposed in this paper can supply controllable virtual inertia of DFIGs to the power system so that the system frequency stability can be strengthened through inertial control of wind turbines on the basis of damping torque analysis.

AB The control strategies have influences on the dynamic stability of modern wind turbines. This article presents a theoretical investigation on this topic. The investigation is motivated by a vibration measurement of wind turbines in a wind farm. The mechanisms of control strategies influencing the dynamic stability have been discussed and the stability enhancement by means of time delay in pitch control is investigated. The results show that the optimum control of rotational speed for maximizing energy capture below rated power can improve the dynamic stability by suppressing the axially unstable vibrations of the wind turbines. At above rated wind speed, the control mode of fixed-speed variable-pitch can cause unstable axial vibrations of the wind turbines; variable-speed variable-pitch can suppress the unstable vibrations. Additionally an appropriate time delay in pitch control can effectively enhance the dynamic stability of wind turbines.

AB Variable-speed doubly fed asynchronous (Type 3) and full converter-based (Type 4) wind turbine generators (WTGs) have complex fault current characteristics governed by proprietary controls. The control technique of some manufacturers is to produce balanced three-phase fault current during unbalanced faults. At present, short-circuit analysis tools commonly used by protection engineers are inadequate in representing the fault current behavior of these WTGs. This paper presents the fault current characteristics of a Type 4 WTG using a detailed MATLAB (R) and Simulink (R) model that incorporates pseudo control logic for this converter type. This paper also presents a case study of a misoperation of directional overcurrent relays connected to the collector circuit in an actual wind power plant during a fault. The paper provides recommendations on protecting wind power plants with these converter-based WTGs.

AB Large scale megawatt wind farms like the Adama wind farm and Ashegoda is being integrated into the Ethiopian Electric Power System. The location of Adama wind farm is about 95 km from Addis Ababa (the capital city of Ethiopia) and 3km from Adama town, with an altitude elevation of 1824 similar to 1976m. The central geographical position of the wind farm is 39 degrees 13'48 '' E, 8 degrees 32'41 '' N. The Adama wind farm has two parts named by Phase-1 and Phase-2 with installed capacity of 51 MW and 153 MW respectively. Both Wind farms use variable speed wind turbines. However, the wind turbine type of Adama Phase-1 wind farm is a permanent magnet synchronous generator direct derive wind turbine (PMSG WT) while Adama phase-2 wind turbine is doubly fed induction generator wind turbine (DFIG WT). In this study the dynamic behavior of these wind turbines under fault conditions is discussed. The dynamic modeling of major components involved in wind energy conversion systems like aerodynamic modeling of the turbine rotor, dynamic modeling of generator, shaft system, drive train, controllers, converters, and other components that are involved in wind energy conversion process is done. Modeling and simulation of wind turbines (both PMSG WT and DFIG WT) are done by the DigSILENT PowerFactory Simulation tool. The wind farms (both phase-1 and phase-2) are modeled by aggregated modeling approach and tested for Fault Ride-through capability during three phase short circuit fault on the electric grid near to the wind farms. The simulation results showed that the integration of the wind farms to Ethiopian Electric Power Utility (EEU) network is feasible with respect Fault ride-through capability.

AB MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) which means maximizing the power extracted, is a key factor that has critical role in improving wind system performance. Wind systems with outputs variables because their input quantities are variable, why an MPPT algorithm that follows the maximum performance is required. Indeed, the performance of a wind turbine depends primarily on three parameters: wind power, curve power turbine and the generator's ability respond to wind fluctuations. This article is dedicated to the study of a wind MPPT system characteristic P= f (Omega). To do this, double feed asynchronous generator is modeled and NPC three level converter. Thereafter, explaining the different strategies maximizing power extracted.

AB This paper presents torque control in an wind powered induction generator driven by a variable speed wind turbine using stator flux oriented vector control. To avoid the use of position sensor or flux sensor in a field oriented induction generator system, the terminal quantities are often use to estimate the stator flux. Since the estimation of the stator flux is independent of the leakage, the steady state performance of the stator flux oriented system is insensitive to the leakage inductance. A decoupler is designed to minimize the coupling in the stator flux reference frame and hence the dynamic performance of the system is improved. Results obtained in Matlab/Simulink environment are presented illustrating good control system performance.

AB Wind turbines systems considered multivariable processes can work in several operational modes. Each mode can be represented with a dynamic model. This fact supposes a difficulty in controlling these types of systems. In addition, the models are subjected undesired interactions between variables. In this paper, different multivariable methodologies are proposed to deal with the previous problems when they are applied to a variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbine. Specifically, the proposed methods to be performed and compared are a multivariable robust control based on the H-infinity mixed sensitivity problem and multivariable control strategies with different decoupling networks.

AB This paper proposes a new design approach of discrete sliding mode control for variable speed wind turbine in presence of saturation constraint. The saturation is reported on inputs vector. The design of the sliding surface is formulated as a pole assignment of linear saturated systems in a specific region through convex optimization. It is well know that the mechanisms are investigated in term of the most proposed assumptions to deal with the damping, shaft stiffness and inertia effect of the gear. The existing control techniques do not take into account the dynamical aspect of the wind and the turbine, which leads to significant power losses, besides, they are not robust. Finally, the validity and the applicability of this approach are illustrated by a numerical simulation.
